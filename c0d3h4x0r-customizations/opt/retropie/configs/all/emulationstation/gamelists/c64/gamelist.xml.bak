		<name>Archon II: Adept</name>
		<desc>Archon 2 or also Adept is the successor of the successful Electronic Arts classic Archon. As already seen in Archon, an apocalyptic fight takes place in a fantasy surrounding, now not between "light" and "dark" but between "order" and "chaos". 

It all happens in a game area which is divided into 4 elemental layers. In the center is the earth layer, it is surrounded by the water layer and this is surrounded by the air layer. The outer layer is made of fire. 
Opposite to its forerunner the players start in Adept only with one magician ("Adept") per layer. All the other creatures have to be conjured in the course of the game. Evocations and other spells cost energy, which is renewed by occupying energy points on the game area with your own creatures. The more points you occupy, the more energy you get. 

Every side possesses 4 own elemental beings, which have a special force when they are on their corresponding layer. Moreover 4 different demons can be conjured from both sides, which can fight independently from the chosen element. Many of these creatures can use a shooting attack, but they have also lots of special attacks. 

When two figures meet on a field, here also the screen is zoomed and a fight for life and death starts. The winner claims the hard-fought field. 

Dependent on the layer you are fighting on, the battlefield has different obstacles such as slowing-down lakes, shoot destracting swirls, flame walls or simply walls ready. The only exception are the two void fields, here no terrain is used</desc>

		<name>B.C. II: Grog's Revenge</name>
		<desc>The player controls Thor, a caveman, who rides a stone unicycle. Thor is searching for the "Meaning of Life" within several mountains.

The player must navigate through the mountains, collecting clams. Like the comic strip, they are used as money, in this case to pay the toll to another caveman, Peter, to access the next mountain.

There are two modes of play. The first is along the mountainside, where the user can move all four directions, but must avoid falling off the cliff, slamming into the wall, hitting a rock or a hole, or encountering the creature Grog, who will yell "GROG" and knock the player off the mountain. There is also a green dinosaur that will eat the player's "tire" on contact. The player may enter caves to enter the second mode. The caves are dark except for a beam of light emanating from the player, and clams must be collected without running into stalagmites. At the end of a mountain, there is a bridge to a new mountain. If the player has enough clams, the game continues; otherwise, it is necessary to return to find more clams.</desc>

		<name>Caverns of Khafka</name>
		<desc>Find 5 holy seals in a labyrinth and attach them to the gate at the temple of Pharao Khafka to open the gate. Enter the tomb, outwit the ghost guards and get the treasure. . . . .

This sounds easy, but it is not, because the people of the pharao does not live any more but all lockings and traps still work well. Furthermore, evil bugs, rolling and falling rocks, magma and bats obstruct the search. And finally, some tunnels and channels are very narrow so that our brave treasure hunter (or tomb raider) must crawl through them to avoid hurting his head.

In the unlikely event that you find all seals and get to the guards of the treasure, the most dagnerous task will follow, as you need to pass the guard without touching it. If this succeeds the adventurer will be awarded the Treasure of the Pharao, if not he will die a cruel death. . .</desc>

		<desc>The player moves the character about the bottom area of the screen and fires laser shots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of mushrooms. Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.</desc>

Mortars, grenades and dynamite rain from the skies and explode around you. Enemy bullets fly past you in all directions, trenches, cliffs and lakes block your path. Rebel forces appear from caves, strong holds and troop carriers to stop your progress. You must show no mercy. You must not retreat. You must keep pushing yourself further and further into enemy lines, collecting supplies of hand-grenades from defeated outposts, until you reach your final objective, the fortress.

		<desc>You are Super Joe the cracked combat soldier of the eighties battling against all odds to defeat the advancing rebel forces. Equipped with only an M60 machine gun and six hand-grenades you carry out your lone crusade, forcing your way into hostile territory. Mortars, grenades and dynamite rain from the skies and explode around you. Enemy bullets fly past you in all directions, trenches, cliffs and lakes block your path. Rebel forces appear from caves, strong holds and troop carriers to stop your progress. You must show no mercy. You must not retreat. You must keep pushing yourself further and further into enemy lines, collecting supplies of hand-grenades from defeated outposts, until you reach your final objective, the fortress.

Have you got the skill and stamina to defeat the enemy?</desc>

		<name>Crystal Castles</name>
		<desc>Crystal Castles has nine levels with four castles each, and a tenth level which features a single castle — the clearing of which ends the game. Each of the 37 trimetric-projected castles consists of a maze of hallways filled with gems and bonus objects, and also includes stairs, elevators and tunnels that the player can use as shortcuts. The three-letter initials of the player with the highest score are used to form the first level's castle structure. When all gems in a castle have been collected, the player moves on to the next castle. The player can also skip some castles and acquire additional lives and points by using secret warps activated by making Bentley Bear jump at special locations.</desc>

		<desc>Dark Caves is a H.E.R.O. clone in which the you control a treasure hunter searching for treasure under the surface of the earth. Equipped with a jetpack, a short-ranged beam weapon and a limited number of bombs, you must reach the exit before running out of energy. The amount of energy available is displayed at the bottom of the screen. It depletes over time and when the jetpack or the beam weapon is used. When navigating through the caves, you must avoid contact with enemies, spikes and other deadly objects. The beam weapon can be used to dispatch enemies, while bombs are used to destroy walls. If you have run out of bombs, you can also use the beam weapon to destroy walls, which uses up a lot of energy. 

In the final level, a Tetris-inspired puzzle has to be solved. However, instead of clearing lines, the goal in this case is to fill up the lower part of the screen without leaving a gap.</desc>

		<name>Davids Midnight Magic</name>
		<desc>written by David Snider and released by Brøderbund in 1982. The game was published in Europe by Ariolasoft.

David's Midnight Magic is closely modeled after the popular real-life pinball table Black Knight, released by Williams in 1980.[citation needed] The computer simulation, unlike Black Knight, contains bright colors such as green, pink, and blue (depending somewhat on the version of the game) in contrast to Black Knight's darker medieval theme.These colors were used to great advantage by illustrator Marc Ericksen as he produced for Broderbund one of his earliest game art efforts showing a pinball player's face reflected on a floating chrome pinball, with the pinball game surface floating over a ghostly desert scene. The same art was used in the Atari 2600 version, but the reflection of the player was removed.. Atari released a pinball game called Midnight Magic for the Atari 2600 that plays differently from the similarly named David's Midnight Magic.</desc>

		<name>Defender</name>
		<desc>Defender is an arcade video game developed and released by Williams Electronics in February 1981.[1] A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis' first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.

Defender was one of the most important titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.</desc>

There are two kinds of enemies in the game: Pookas, round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles, and Fygars, green dragons who can breathe fire. The player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.</desc>

This gameplay style is called a tube shooter, and Gyruss is one of the very few examples that exist. The familiar scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games was arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving very fast through space.</desc>

		<desc>The object of the game is to defuse all bombs in a platform-filled screen. Jumpman defuses a bomb by touching it. According to the story, these are placed on Jupiter by terrorists. Jumpman can climb up and down ladders, and of course jump, and there are two kinds of rope each allowing a single direction of climbing only. Hazards include falling, "smart darts" (small bullets that fly slowly across the screen, but when orthogonally lined up with Jumpman, greatly speed up and shoot straight in his direction) and other hazards that are unique to a certain level.

Points are awarded for each bomb defused, with bonus points available for completing a level quickly. Jumpman's game run-speed can be chosen by the player, with faster speeds being riskier but providing greater opportunity to earn bonus points.</desc>

		<name>Mancopter</name>
		<desc>Mancopter is a side view horizontal game where the screen scrolls from right to left when you move, as you control your hero flying a primitive helicopter powered by pedal-power for a race over the ocean. You must fly and pass as many other competitors as you can as you try to get from the start-line to a finish-line a long distance away. To fly your helicopter you keep pressing the fire button to stay airborne and press left to move along the screen. If you stop pressing the fire button then you fall downwards towards the water, if you stop pressing left then your momentum keeps you going until you slowly come to a halt. The race is timed and you start with seventy seconds and this decreases as you race but passing buoys gives you forty extra seconds.

The other competitors fill the skies and you can avoid them or hit the top of their helicopter which sends them into the water but if you are hit from above then you fall into the sea. You are carrying four fish and every time you hit the water then a whale appears and lifts you onto it's head but at the loss of a fish and if you have no more fish when you hit the water then a shark appears and eats you. Pelicans fly in the air from left to right and if they have a fish in their mouth then when hit gives you the fish and you can carry up to eight. Hit a pelican without a fish and it takes one of yours and if you hit one without carrying any then you hit the water and get eaten once again.

Other creatures to avoid are squids, dodos, and storm clouds which release lightning and if you are hit by any then a fish is lost. If you run out of time then a fish is lost but you are given five seconds to try to reach a buoy. Trees make an appearance and you are unable to pass the leaves and branches so you must fly underneath while avoiding hitting the water. During the race, rafts make an appearance and when landed on give you bonus points for time remaining and competitors passed. Hitting a competitor into the water doesn't count as a pass.</desc>

		<name>Omega Race</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

As well as the droid's standard movement mode, it can also tunnel or dig through the caverns. In later levels, the cavern designs become more complex and moving blocks create further problems.</desc>

		<name>Planetfall</name>
		<desc>Planetfall is a science fiction interactive fiction computer game written by Steve Meretzky, and the eighth title published by Infocom in 1983. Like most Infocom games, thanks to the portable Z-machine, it was released for several platforms simultaneously. The original release included versions for the PC (both as a booter and for DOS) and Apple II. The Atari ST and Commodore 64 versions were released in 1985. A version for CP/M was also released. Although Planetfall was Meretzky's first title, it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom; it was one of five top-selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Planetfall utilizes the Z-machine originally developed for the Zork franchise and was added as a bonus to the "Zork Anthology".

The word planetfall is a portmanteau of planet and landfall, and occasionally used in science fiction to that effect. The book Planetfall written by Arthur Byron Cover, uses the game image on the cover, and is marketed "In the bestselling tradition of THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.[2] A sequel, Stationfall, was released in 1987.

Planetfall teleports you 12,000 years into an outrageous future. You joined the Stellar Patrol to explore the galaxy, but all you've seen is the end of a mop - until your ship explodes and you're jettisoned onto a mysterious, deserted planet. Luckily, you have Floyd, a lovable multi-purpose robot with the personality of a mischievous 8-year-old. He's the ideal companion with whom to brave your new world, as you dare its dangers and uncover its secrets.</desc>

		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of the Beast</name>
		<desc>Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platform video game produced by Reflections and published by Psygnosis in 1989. The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to many other systems. Shadow of the Beast is considered revolutionary at the time, because of its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. It was also notable for its atmospheric score composed by David Whittaker that used high-quality instrument samples.

Shadow of the Beast was followed by two sequels, Shadow of the Beast II in 1990 and Shadow of the Beast III in 1992. A remake is in development for the PlayStation 4.</desc>

		<name>Shoot Out</name>
		<desc>Shoot-out is a traditional arcade western shooter and it takes place in the desert landscape of Gulch Creek. Each level is composed by two distinct scenarios. The player will play as Quick Hand Luke.

In the first scenario Quick Hand Luke will practice his targeting skills and has to hit a specific number of cans. The scenario is static and the player stands on a fixed point of it. If he misses a single can, the game is over.

In the next scenario and according to each level, Quick Hand Luke will enter in a part of Gulch Creek. Although the player's location is fixed, he can move to the right and left of the scenario. The endings of it are the boundaries of the town, peaceful and filled with Indian tents. 

As soon as the player enters the town, several outlaws may be hiding behind the windows of the buildings as much as the townsfolk. A single shot is enough to kill one of them and the player's ammunition is unlimited. The player as to kill a specific number of targets which will proportionally increase according to the more advanced levels.

The process of aiming is constantly in movement adding more difficulty and giving more realism to the game.</desc>

		<name>Silkworm</name>
		<desc>Silkworm had interesting graphics and relatively fast-paced gameplay. The player can take control of a Jeep mounted with a machine gun or a Helicopter mounted with forward and downward firing guns. Two players can work simultaneously and cooperatively against enemies, with one playing as the Jeep and one as the Helicopter.

In single-player mode, it is generally easier to play with the Helicopter than with the Jeep, but it can be more fun to play as the Jeep. As the Jeep, the player needs to destroy everything directly in front of it or be prepared to jump in order to avoid collisions. In two-player mode, the Helicopter and Jeep must cooperate, and the players depend on each other to succeed. For example, the Helicopter can only fire forward, so occasionally, the Jeep must cover the rear with his swiveling gun. However, when covering the rear, the Jeep is vulnerable from the front, so the Helicopter must cover him.

Silkworm featured a fairly wide variety of enemies, some of which had specific weaknesses, such as the armoured AA guns that could only be harmed when their shields were down to fire. Most famously, there was the "Goose" helicopter - a giant, heavily armoured "mini-boss" helicopter that was composed of several smaller vehicles that connected together.

The players collect shields (which could alternatively be shot by the player in order to destroy all enemies on the screen), power cells which increase firepower and an additional bonus can be added to the score achieved. The game gets harder on the completion of each level. The game employed some destructible environmental elements, such as buildings and ancient ruins.

The speed was one of the defining parts of the gameplay, which the programmers who worked on the home conversions were keen to preserve, using a variety of programming techniques.[5] One element that required work was the control system (the arcade original had three buttons, whereas most home systems had just one), but this was solved without much problem.

Silkworm featured a background music theme composed by Barry Leitch, which went on to be a minor cult hit, being included on a Sinclair User covermounted cassette, along with such classics as Shinobi and Continental Circus.</desc>

Each pits you head to head with a friend, shooting ramps or racing downhill, while going for rock n' rolls, hand plants, aerials, rail slides and methods! Then blast into "Mad Max on Wheels", dueling to the death with Bionic Lester, the dirtiest dude in the jam and joust. And finally "Skate and Destroy", a challenge that'll turn you into a Samurai skater, karate chopping your way through a tough alley filled with thugs, trash and unmentionable traffic hazards.

		<desc>Slam-Dunk is a two on two basketball game. Play against the computer or against another player. The game is divided into 4 quarters of three minutes each. The team with the highest score at the end of the final quarter wins. An overtime session can occur if the game ends in a tie. 

The game provides a practice session. Here you can learn the moves and plays needed to beat your opponent.

You control one of your players on your team. Your teammate will be controlled by the computer, based on your movements of the controllable player. On offense, you control the man with the ball. On defense, you control the man guarding the ball. On defense, you can switch your controllable player by moving the joystick right while pressing the button. 

In this fast paced game, fouling can occur if defense plays too close or offense shoves its way into a defensive man. After five fouls, free throws will be shot. If you're shooting free throws, simply hit the button to take the shot. Made free throws count as one point.

Keep an eye on the shot clock. Don't get caught holding the ball. Remember that any shot taken and made outside the three-point line is worth three points.

Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom; shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is destroyed, the section behind it becomes the next head.</desc>

		<name>Defender</name>
		<desc>Defender is an arcade video game developed and released by Williams Electronics in February 1981.[1] A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis' first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.

Defender was one of the most important titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.</desc>

There are two kinds of enemies in the game: Pookas, round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles, and Fygars, green dragons who can breathe fire. The player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.</desc>

		<name>Omega Race</name>
		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<name>Pitstop</name>
		<desc>Pitstop is an action racing game featuring six different race tracks. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.</desc>

		<desc>Defender is an arcade video game developed and released by Williams Electronics in February 1981.[1] A shooting game featuring two-dimensional (2D) graphics, the game is set on a fictional planet where the player must defeat waves of invading aliens while protecting astronauts. Development was led by Eugene Jarvis, a pinball programmer at Williams; Defender was Jarvis' first video game project and drew inspiration from Space Invaders and Asteroids. Williams planned to display the game at the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) trade show, though development delays resulted in the team working on the game up until the show started.

Defender was one of the most important titles of the Golden Age of Video Arcade Games, selling over 55,000 units to become the company's best selling game and one of the highest-grossing arcade games ever. Praise among critics focused on the game's audio-visuals and gameplay. It is frequently listed as one of Jarvis' best contributions to the video game industry, as well as one of the most difficult video games. Defender was ported to numerous platforms, inspired the development of other games, and was followed by sequels and many imitations.</desc>

There are two kinds of enemies in the game: Pookas, round red monsters (said to be modeled after tomatoes) who wear yellow goggles, and Fygars, green dragons who can breathe fire. The player's character is Dig Dug, dressed in white and blue, and able to dig tunnels. Dig Dug is killed if he is caught by either Pooka or Fygar, burned by a Fygar's fire, or crushed by a rock.</desc>

		<name>Mancopter</name>
		<desc>Mancopter is a side view horizontal game where the screen scrolls from right to left when you move, as you control your hero flying a primitive helicopter powered by pedal-power for a race over the ocean. You must fly and pass as many other competitors as you can as you try to get from the start-line to a finish-line a long distance away. To fly your helicopter you keep pressing the fire button to stay airborne and press left to move along the screen. If you stop pressing the fire button then you fall downwards towards the water, if you stop pressing left then your momentum keeps you going until you slowly come to a halt. The race is timed and you start with seventy seconds and this decreases as you race but passing buoys gives you forty extra seconds.

The other competitors fill the skies and you can avoid them or hit the top of their helicopter which sends them into the water but if you are hit from above then you fall into the sea. You are carrying four fish and every time you hit the water then a whale appears and lifts you onto it's head but at the loss of a fish and if you have no more fish when you hit the water then a shark appears and eats you. Pelicans fly in the air from left to right and if they have a fish in their mouth then when hit gives you the fish and you can carry up to eight. Hit a pelican without a fish and it takes one of yours and if you hit one without carrying any then you hit the water and get eaten once again.

Other creatures to avoid are squids, dodos, and storm clouds which release lightning and if you are hit by any then a fish is lost. If you run out of time then a fish is lost but you are given five seconds to try to reach a buoy. Trees make an appearance and you are unable to pass the leaves and branches so you must fly underneath while avoiding hitting the water. During the race, rafts make an appearance and when landed on give you bonus points for time remaining and competitors passed. Hitting a competitor into the water doesn't count as a pass.</desc>

		<desc>This is a remake of a Bally-Midway arcade game. You control a spaceship and shoot down the enemy "Droid" ships that attack you. Your ship must survive Droid-dropped mines too--but you can shoot them too. The last ship of the Droid flights goes into a spiraling pattern.

There is no end to this game. Rather, it is a game in which you try to get the highest score, or complete the highest number of levels.

You control a small triangle that is your ship. The ship can turn, move forward (with thrusters) and fire. Movement is one of the games challenges; once the ship is moving, it can only be slowed by turning the nose in the opposite direction and use the thrusters. While doing that, the ship is unable to fire toward anything it is in motion toward.

Bouncing also comes into play during movement. When the ship hits the side of the screen, a wall of force appears, and the ship bounces. You don't have control over where the ship bounces, and must take time to regain control, before you run into an enemy ship and die.</desc>

		<name>Archon II: Adept</name>
		<desc>Archon 2 or also Adept is the successor of the successful Electronic Arts classic Archon. As already seen in Archon, an apocalyptic fight takes place in a fantasy surrounding, now not between "light" and "dark" but between "order" and "chaos". 

It all happens in a game area which is divided into 4 elemental layers. In the center is the earth layer, it is surrounded by the water layer and this is surrounded by the air layer. The outer layer is made of fire. 
Opposite to its forerunner the players start in Adept only with one magician ("Adept") per layer. All the other creatures have to be conjured in the course of the game. Evocations and other spells cost energy, which is renewed by occupying energy points on the game area with your own creatures. The more points you occupy, the more energy you get. 

Every side possesses 4 own elemental beings, which have a special force when they are on their corresponding layer. Moreover 4 different demons can be conjured from both sides, which can fight independently from the chosen element. Many of these creatures can use a shooting attack, but they have also lots of special attacks. 

When two figures meet on a field, here also the screen is zoomed and a fight for life and death starts. The winner claims the hard-fought field. 

Dependent on the layer you are fighting on, the battlefield has different obstacles such as slowing-down lakes, shoot destracting swirls, flame walls or simply walls ready. The only exception are the two void fields, here no terrain is used</desc>

		<name>Archon: The Light and the Dark</name>
		<desc>Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side..

However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.

Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard &amp; the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.

The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.</desc>

Beyond the twisted iron gates of Castlevania there lurks an unearthly terror who stalks the night in search of revenge... and blood.

With darkness and fear slowly engulfing the town, village elders are calling on you, Simon Belmont - the one hero with the power to forever entomb that death defying demon - Count Dracula.

To survive you'll need the strength to wield weapons like the whip, dagger, hatchet and fire bomb. You'll also need a ferocious intellect to find the option that renders you invisible and the clock that suspends time, both of which are hidden in a maze of cobwebs and torture chambers.

But before you sharpen your stake, know that behind these purgatory walls are dungeons, tombs and haunted hallways filled with hundreds of creatures who have escaped from the grave. These gothic horrors include the Ax Man, the Skele-Dragon, the Mummy Man, the She Worm and that cursed "dead-head" - the Grim Reaper.

At every turn these occult obstacles will become more vicious. And, as you step deeper and deeper into the darkness, their point values will slowly pale in comparison to the value you'll place on staying alive.

So grab your cross of gold and prepare to confront the blood thirsty Count in a deadly adventure that will surely leave you drained.

For 1 player only.</desc>

		<name>Davids Midnight Magic</name>
		<desc>written by David Snider and released by Brøderbund in 1982. The game was published in Europe by Ariolasoft.

David's Midnight Magic is closely modeled after the popular real-life pinball table Black Knight, released by Williams in 1980.[citation needed] The computer simulation, unlike Black Knight, contains bright colors such as green, pink, and blue (depending somewhat on the version of the game) in contrast to Black Knight's darker medieval theme.These colors were used to great advantage by illustrator Marc Ericksen as he produced for Broderbund one of his earliest game art efforts showing a pinball player's face reflected on a floating chrome pinball, with the pinball game surface floating over a ghostly desert scene. The same art was used in the Atari 2600 version, but the reflection of the player was removed.. Atari released a pinball game called Midnight Magic for the Atari 2600 that plays differently from the similarly named David's Midnight Magic.</desc>

		<name>Slam Dunk</name>
		<desc>Slam-Dunk is a two on two basketball game. Play against the computer or against another player. The game is divided into 4 quarters of three minutes each. The team with the highest score at the end of the final quarter wins. An overtime session can occur if the game ends in a tie.

The game provides a practice session. Here you can learn the moves and plays needed to beat your opponent.

You control one of your players on your team. Your teammate will be controlled by the computer, based on your movements of the controllable player. On offense, you control the man with the ball. On defense, you control the man guarding the ball. On defense, you can switch your controllable player by moving the joystick right while pressing the button.

In this fast paced game, fouling can occur if defense plays too close or offense shoves its way into a defensive man. After five fouls, free throws will be shot. If you're shooting free throws, simply hit the button to take the shot. Made free throws count as one point.

Keep an eye on the shot clock. Don't get caught holding the ball. Remember that any shot taken and made outside the three-point line is worth three points.</desc>

		<name>Pitstop</name>
		<desc>Pitstop is an action racing game featuring six different race tracks. Your goal is to earn as much money as possible by winning races in the Grand Circuit which consists of a race on each of the six tracks; each time a race is completed, you'll earn money based on how you placed and the number of laps completed before moving on. While you are racing, keep an eye on your tires and fuel; if your tires become too worn (causing a blowout) or you run out of fuel, the game will be over. To prevent this from happening, you'll need to make a pitstop. Here you control the pit crew and can replace tires and refuel. While in the pit the race is still going on, of course, so repairs need to be made as quickly as possible to get back into the race without losing too much ground. Several game options are available to control the level of difficulty and the number of laps. In addition to the Grand Circuit which is the full race, you can also practice a track in a single race or enter the mini circuit which consists of three races.</desc>

		<desc>Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platform video game produced by Reflections and published by Psygnosis in 1989. The original version was released for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to many other systems. Shadow of the Beast is considered revolutionary at the time, because of its graphics, with many more colours on screen and up to twelve levels of parallax scrolling backdrops, were of a level rarely if ever seen before in action games. It was also notable for its atmospheric score composed by David Whittaker that used high-quality instrument samples.

Shadow of the Beast was followed by two sequels, Shadow of the Beast II in 1990 and Shadow of the Beast III in 1992. A remake is in development for the PlayStation 4.</desc>

The player must navigate through the mountains, collecting clams. Like the comic strip, they are used as money, in this case to pay the toll to another caveman, Peter, to access the next mountain.

There are two modes of play. The first is along the mountainside, where the user can move all four directions, but must avoid falling off the cliff, slamming into the wall, hitting a rock or a hole, or encountering the creature Grog, who will yell "GROG" and knock the player off the mountain. There is also a green dinosaur that will eat the player's "tire" on contact. The player may enter caves to enter the second mode. The caves are dark except for a beam of light emanating from the player, and clams must be collected without running into stalagmites. At the end of a mountain, there is a bridge to a new mountain. If the player has enough clams, the game continues; otherwise, it is necessary to return to find more clams.</desc>

This sounds easy, but it is not, because the people of the pharao does not live any more but all lockings and traps still work well. Furthermore, evil bugs, rolling and falling rocks, magma and bats obstruct the search. And finally, some tunnels and channels are very narrow so that our brave treasure hunter (or tomb raider) must crawl through them to avoid hurting his head.

In the unlikely event that you find all seals and get to the guards of the treasure, the most dagnerous task will follow, as you need to pass the guard without touching it. If this succeeds the adventurer will be awarded the Treasure of the Pharao, if not he will die a cruel death. . .</desc>

The amount of energy available is displayed at the bottom of the screen. It depletes over time and when the jetpack or the beam weapon is used. When navigating through the caves, you must avoid contact with enemies, spikes and other deadly objects. The beam weapon can be used to dispatch enemies, while bombs are used to destroy walls. If you have run out of bombs, you can also use the beam weapon to destroy walls, which uses up a lot of energy. 

In the final level, a Tetris-inspired puzzle has to be solved. However, instead of clearing lines, the goal in this case is to fill up the lower part of the screen without leaving a gap.</desc>

In practice, this requires the player to direct the carpet over diamond-shaped gates as they appear; failure to do so returns the prince to the beginning of the tunnel</desc>

		<name>Planetfall</name>
		<desc>Planetfall is a science fiction interactive fiction computer game written by Steve Meretzky, and the eighth title published by Infocom in 1983. Like most Infocom games, thanks to the portable Z-machine, it was released for several platforms simultaneously. The original release included versions for the PC (both as a booter and for DOS) and Apple II. The Atari ST and Commodore 64 versions were released in 1985. A version for CP/M was also released. Although Planetfall was Meretzky's first title, it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom; it was one of five top-selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Planetfall utilizes the Z-machine originally developed for the Zork franchise and was added as a bonus to the "Zork Anthology".

The word planetfall is a portmanteau of planet and landfall, and occasionally used in science fiction to that effect. The book Planetfall written by Arthur Byron Cover, uses the game image on the cover, and is marketed "In the bestselling tradition of THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.[2] A sequel, Stationfall, was released in 1987.

Planetfall teleports you 12,000 years into an outrageous future. You joined the Stellar Patrol to explore the galaxy, but all you've seen is the end of a mop - until your ship explodes and you're jettisoned onto a mysterious, deserted planet. Luckily, you have Floyd, a lovable multi-purpose robot with the personality of a mischievous 8-year-old. He's the ideal companion with whom to brave your new world, as you dare its dangers and uncover its secrets.</desc>

		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.</desc>

		<path>./untested/Silkworm.d64</path>
		<name>Silkworm</name>
		<desc>Silkworm had interesting graphics and relatively fast-paced gameplay. The player can take control of a Jeep mounted with a machine gun or a Helicopter mounted with forward and downward firing guns. Two players can work simultaneously and cooperatively against enemies, with one playing as the Jeep and one as the Helicopter.

In single-player mode, it is generally easier to play with the Helicopter than with the Jeep, but it can be more fun to play as the Jeep. As the Jeep, the player needs to destroy everything directly in front of it or be prepared to jump in order to avoid collisions. In two-player mode, the Helicopter and Jeep must cooperate, and the players depend on each other to succeed. For example, the Helicopter can only fire forward, so occasionally, the Jeep must cover the rear with his swiveling gun. However, when covering the rear, the Jeep is vulnerable from the front, so the Helicopter must cover him.

Silkworm featured a fairly wide variety of enemies, some of which had specific weaknesses, such as the armoured AA guns that could only be harmed when their shields were down to fire. Most famously, there was the "Goose" helicopter - a giant, heavily armoured "mini-boss" helicopter that was composed of several smaller vehicles that connected together.

The players collect shields (which could alternatively be shot by the player in order to destroy all enemies on the screen), power cells which increase firepower and an additional bonus can be added to the score achieved. The game gets harder on the completion of each level. The game employed some destructible environmental elements, such as buildings and ancient ruins.

The speed was one of the defining parts of the gameplay, which the programmers who worked on the home conversions were keen to preserve, using a variety of programming techniques.[5] One element that required work was the control system (the arcade original had three buttons, whereas most home systems had just one), but this was solved without much problem.

Silkworm featured a background music theme composed by Barry Leitch, which went on to be a minor cult hit, being included on a Sinclair User covermounted cassette, along with such classics as Shinobi and Continental Circus.</desc>

Three of these twisted trials are cut from the concrete courses of pro competitions. Each pits you head to head with a friend, shooting ramps or racing downhill, while going for rock n' rolls, hand plants, aerials, rail slides and methods! Then blast into "Mad Max on Wheels", dueling to the death with Bionic Lester, the dirtiest dude in the jam and joust. And finally "Skate and Destroy", a challenge that'll turn you into a Samurai skater, karate chopping your way through a tough alley filled with thugs, trash and unmentionable traffic hazards. So squirt a little oil onto your ball bearings, and prepare to Skate or Die!</desc>

		<desc>Slam-Dunk is a two on two basketball game. Play against the computer or against another player. The game is divided into 4 quarters of three minutes each. The team with the highest score at the end of the final quarter wins. An overtime session can occur if the game ends in a tie. 

The game provides a practice session. Here you can learn the moves and plays needed to beat your opponent.

You control one of your players on your team. Your teammate will be controlled by the computer, based on your movements of the controllable player. On offense, you control the man with the ball. On defense, you control the man guarding the ball. On defense, you can switch your controllable player by moving the joystick right while pressing the button. 

In this fast paced game, fouling can occur if defense plays too close or offense shoves its way into a defensive man. After five fouls, free throws will be shot. If you're shooting free throws, simply hit the button to take the shot. Made free throws count as one point.

Keep an eye on the shot clock. Don't get caught holding the ball. Remember that any shot taken and made outside the three-point line is worth three points.

		<name>Gyruss</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is very similar to that of Galaga but with an added twist: the game is presented in a forced 3D perspective, with the player's ship facing 'into' the screen and able to move around the perimeter of an implicit circle - essentially, Gyruss was Galaga mapped onto a Tempest-like cylinder. This gameplay style is called a tube shooter, and Gyruss is one of the very few examples that exist. The familiar scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games was arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving very fast through space.</desc>

		<name>Jumpman Junior</name>
		<desc>The object of the game is to defuse all bombs in a platform-filled screen. Jumpman defuses a bomb by touching it. According to the story, these are placed on Jupiter by terrorists. Jumpman can climb up and down ladders, and of course jump, and there are two kinds of rope each allowing a single direction of climbing only. Hazards include falling, "smart darts" (small bullets that fly slowly across the screen, but when orthogonally lined up with Jumpman, greatly speed up and shoot straight in his direction) and other hazards that are unique to a certain level.

Points are awarded for each bomb defused, with bonus points available for completing a level quickly. Jumpman's game run-speed can be chosen by the player, with faster speeds being riskier but providing greater opportunity to earn bonus points.

This is the cartridge version with less levels that the full disk version.</desc>

		<desc>Crystal Castles has nine levels with four castles each, and a tenth level which features a single castle — the clearing of which ends the game. Each of the 37 trimetric-projected castles consists of a maze of hallways filled with gems and bonus objects, and also includes stairs, elevators and tunnels that the player can use as shortcuts. The three-letter initials of the player with the highest score are used to form the first level's castle structure. When all gems in a castle have been collected, the player moves on to the next castle. The player can also skip some castles and acquire additional lives and points by using secret warps activated by making Bentley Bear jump at special locations.</desc>

		<desc>Within this box your fate may be sealed.

Beyond the twisted iron gates of Castlevania there lurks an unearthly terror who stalks the night in search of revenge... and blood.

With darkness and fear slowly engulfing the town, village elders are calling on you, Simon Belmont - the one hero with the power to forever entomb that death defying demon - Count Dracula.

To survive you'll need the strength to wield weapons like the whip, dagger, hatchet and fire bomb. You'll also need a ferocious intellect to find the option that renders you invisible and the clock that suspends time, both of which are hidden in a maze of cobwebs and torture chambers.

But before you sharpen your stake, know that behind these purgatory walls are dungeons, tombs and haunted hallways filled with hundreds of creatures who have escaped from the grave. These gothic horrors include the Ax Man, the Skele-Dragon, the Mummy Man, the She Worm and that cursed "dead-head" - the Grim Reaper.

At every turn these occult obstacles will become more vicious. And, as you step deeper and deeper into the darkness, their point values will slowly pale in comparison to the value you'll place on staying alive.

So grab your cross of gold and prepare to confront the blood thirsty Count in a deadly adventure that will surely leave you drained.

For 1 player only.</desc>
