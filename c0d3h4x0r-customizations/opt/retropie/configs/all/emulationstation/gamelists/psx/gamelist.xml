This version of the game has a few notable differences to its Nintendo 64 counterpart: it runs off a version of the Medal of Honor engine, and has 11 missions in contrast to the N64's 14; some of which are not shared between the two. The missions that are similar (usually those taken from the film) further tend to play out differently, and utilize completely different gadgets and weaponry.</desc>

		<desc>In 007 Racing you can get behind the wheel of James Bond's car.

You must complete missions which range from collecting an object and getting out alive, to much harder and more complicated things. Your car is armed with many weapons including mines, rockets, lasers, smokescreens, and more.

Then, if you get bored playing alone, you can eliminate your opponent in multiplayer missions where you have to destroy the other car, or a game mode called "Pass the Bomb", where you must pass the bomb to the other car by touching it before you blow up.</desc>

		<desc>Action Bass is an arcade-type fishing game that emphasizes the action of trying to catch a big fish, and the struggle of reeling it in without it getting away. The game features two game modes, which are Challenge and Free mode.

In the challenge mode, players compete in a tournament where they are given three minutes to catch a fish large enough to meet the weight requirement, and this fish must also weigh enough to place within the top three of all the competitor fisherman's catches in order for the player to move on the next fishing area. The skilled fisherman who can complete the challenge mode, will be able to unlock new fishing lures and fishing areas.

In the free mode, players are free to choose from four different fishing areas to practice in, with no competition or time limit to worry about. The fishing areas include fishing by the boathouse, fishing in a jungle setting, fishing by a waterfall which makes the water cloudy, and fishing while the sun is setting.

When the player starts fishing, they must first choose a lure. Some of the lures include the minnow, popper, and pencil bait which each have their own characteristics.

Once the line is cast, a lure action meter appears and the player has to fill it in order to attract the fish. Once the fish gets attracted and gets caught on the line, a line tension meter appears. The player has to be careful while reeling in the fish, to not let this meter fill, or else the line will snap and the fish will be lost. 

The player also gets to keep their 5 biggest catches alive in their aquarium.</desc>

		<desc>Action Man: Operation Extreme features two different gameplay modes that you switch back and forth from during the course of play. The first is a top-down vehicular portion, where the perspective and controls are quite similar to the Grand Theft Auto series. You'll need to chase down the enemy vehicles with your own trusty assortment of cars, motorbikes, and the like, blasting them until they slow down for good. After this, it's on to the third-person action levels, where you control Action Man from behind the back as he makes his way through enemy territory, and must occasionally solve puzzles to get out of whatever predicament he's found himself in this time.

The game's levels feature a myriad of locales, from evil villains' bases to the burning sands of the desert to the arctic chill of the North Pole. You'll face many of Action Man's most notorious fiends during the adventure. You have a host of weapons, from your trusty hand-gun to automatic weapons and even a sniping rifle.</desc>

In this mode, all special moves are unlocked, and some of them allow to go way beyond what rules allow.

4 cameras allow to follow the motion-captured action in the best way possible. Commentary is available in English, German and French.</desc>

		<desc>adidas Power Soccer 98 is the fourth and final title in the Psygnosis series. Offering the classic mix of arcade and simulated gameplay from the previous games, this edition updates the game twelve different types of tournaments and cups, eleven international leagues, 120 national teams and about 30 different stadia to play in.

Aside from the classic gameplay players have different moves such as flick-passes, short dribbles, and sliding tackles. In both both (arcade modes and simulation), there is a speed button that makes players run at an extreme and somewhat unrealistic speed. It is not entirely an advantage as using it widens the gap between the ball and the foot, leaving players wide open for tackles. Unlike similar games, there also isn't a way to scroll through the available players - the game automatically selects the player nearest to the ball.

The camera is dynamic and smoothly zooms in and out to give the best overview of the pitch. Multiplayer is available for up to four players through multitap. It was released in June of 1998 to coincide with the 1998 World Cup played in France at that time.</desc>

		<desc>Lomax's friends are in trouble, and it's up to you to save them from the sinister villain, Evil Ed. Using a magical spell, the fiend has kidnapped them and is forcing them to do whatever he instructs. Adventures of Lomax is a platform game that presents itself as a Lemmings spin-off (after all, it is developed by the same company).

As the hero, you will have to jump and shoot your way through a multitude of side scrolling 2D levels while picking up different power-ups. The special items Lomax encounters gain him invincibility; increase the jumping range and power of his attacks. Most effects fade off in a specific amount of time and are there to give you a quick health boost.

Adventures of Lomax takes place across several stages (over 40 in all) that range from outdoor areas, caves, and dark and spooky castles (four different environments). Because this is a platformer, you'll run across obstacles from time to time, required to either blast things away, like bats and zombies, or jump from platform to platform.</desc>

Some are activated upon touch, while others are stored with the player until used.

The only two gameplay options are 1 player versus the computer or 2 players versus each other.

The former is simply a single game against a friend or the computer. In both modes, players have the option to choose from 70 actual international teams complete with real rosters.

The real meat and potatoes lies within the tournament aspect. Once a team has been selected, the objective is to guide them to the World Cup -- the supreme objective in soccer. After a team plays three matches, the knock-out tournament begins. Weaker teams that are prone to losing are then dropped from the tournament as the quarterfinals begin.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Trilogy is a first-person shooter based on the first three Alien movies. You control Lt. Ripley in three sections, each based on one film: The colony complex on LV426 (from Aliens), the prison planet (from Alien³) and the derelict spaceship (from Alien). Each section consists of about 10 missions. In every mission, certain goals must be accomplished to continue. These include killing a certain number of enemies, finding items or activating switches.

Enemies include everything the Alien life cycle provides: facehuggers, chestbursters, warrior aliens, dog aliens (from Alien³) and Alien queens, one of which waits in the final mission of every section. In addition to the Aliens, you also have to fight employees of the Company, who have either been infected by the Aliens and are beyond saving or who actively want to obstruct your mission.

Weapons to be used include pistol, shotgun, pulse rifle, flame thrower and smart gun. Ammunition, health upgrades and other useful items are scattered throughout the levels. Hidden areas may be uncovered by using explosives like grenades and seismic charges. An auto mapping system helps in not getting lost, night goggles and shoulder lamps (running on battery power) allow you to see in the dark and the motion tracker tells you where your enemies are - but only if they are moving.</desc>

		<desc>Allied General is the sequel to Panzer General and uses the same turn-based gameplay mechanics. This time the player experiences World War II from the Allied point of view during two British, one U.S. and one Russian campaign. The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.

The most important thing to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for a little amount of turns) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.</desc>

Players are challenged to lead the newly hatched sea-monkeys to the safety of the Venus Shell, but must do so without any direct control over them. Instead, players control Nautila, the sea-monkey's protector and guide, who is a 358-year old fish that uses her multi-purpose long nose for various actions.
 Predators, traps, plants, and objects stand in the way of getting her charges to safety, but Nautila can use some underwater creatures to help control the frisky sea-monkeys. Ollie the Octopus, goldfish, blowfish, jellyfish, lantern fish, dogfish, and more can all be harmful in some ways to the sea-monkeys, but their characteristics can also be harnessed by Nautila to good advantage. Other gameplay elements include using bubbles to either protect sea-monkeys or imprison their enemies, collecting a certain number of goldfish to clear levels, and the requirement to rescue a specific number of sea-monkeys within pre-set time limits per level.</desc>

In Training mode, players are presented with 18 stages in which they are shown a sample of a shot done by the computer player that they then have to try to replicate.

The Pocket Game mode lets the player compete in various types of pool games such as 9-Ball, 8-Ball, Basic, Rotation, and 14-1 Ball. Players can set the number of sets to play and the difficulty level.

The Pool Contest mode lets the player create a character with their own name, gender, age, and face avatar (3 different choices for each gender), and compete in a 32 player tournament of 9-Ball. The players character can level up by winning matches which unlocks 6 different powerup techs and 3 special techs. Some techs include Easy Shot which slows down the speed of the shot power meter and Free Ball which allows the cue ball to be placed anywhere on the pool table.

Gameplay consists of the player lining up their shot, choosing where to hit the cue ball with the cue stick, and then determining the strength of their shot by use of a power meter.</desc>

		<desc>Doomsday is steadily approaching the planet Earth; it is a time of war and hatred, a time where madmen rule the streets. The madman in this case is the Reverend and his Four Horsemen: Death, Plague, War, and the Beast. Together, they have initiated a reign of terror upon the world, glorifying and helping the planet's demise.
 The question is who the heck is going to stop these terrorists? Players assume the role of Trey Kincaid, a nano-physicist played by Hollywood action star Bruce Willis. And darn it if he isn't the world's only hope; he has been called upon to defend the world, destroy the Four Horsemen, and thwart the Reverend's plans.
 Apocalypse's goal is a simple one: progress throughout multiple levels and destroy, kill, and exterminate any and all resistance. Played from a third-person 3D viewpoint, Kincaid can maneuver in a 360-degree rotational manner; this is very important as the action takes place on all sides.</desc>

		<desc>A girl named Kukuru lives in a village controlled by the Sacred Tribe - people who guard an ancient flame which contains a powerful spirit that was sealed in it many years ago. Kukuru must marry a man she doesn't love, and in order to avoid this marriage, she accepts the offer of the mayor: he asks her to extinguish the flame. As a result, the spirit awakes and threatens to destroy the world. A young adventurer named Arc arrives to the village at the same moment as Kukuru is standing frightened in front of the spirit. Arc immediately recognizes it - it was the murderer of his father! Before he realizes how that could be possible, the spirit disappears, and now Arc and Kukuru have to do everything in their powers to undo the error, to stop the spirit, and perhaps to avenge the death of Arc's father.

"Arc the Lad" is a hybrid of traditional and strategy-based console-style RPGs. The story unfolds as you are transported from location to location and enter battles - you don't walk around on the world map, choosing yourself which location to visit. The battles take place on a battle field, on which you can move and attack only when you approach the opponent.</desc>

		<desc>This direct sequel to "Arc the Lad" continues the unfinished story of the first game, but starts from a totally different perspective. You control a bounty-hunter named Elk, who suffers from amnesia. On his quest for his own true identity he discovers the powers hidden within him, and the destiny of his entire tribe. While pursuing his archenemy, Elk meets up with Arc, the hero of the first game, and then both realize they have been looking to destroy the very same evil.

The battle system of "Arc the Lad II" is similar to the one used in its predecessor: in battles you can move your characters on the battle field, and your proximity to the enemies plays an important role. You cause and take different amounts of damage depending on your position on the battle field. Unlike the first game, this one is a full-fledged adventure/RPG, without the "strategy" feel of the predecessor. You move through the game world on your own, visiting towns and exploring dungeons.</desc>

		<desc>The events of this game take place several years after Elk and Arc faced their ultimate enemy in "Arc the Lad II". You control Alec, a teenager whose entire village was destroyed by an unknown evil - an event that was later called "The Great Disaster". He was saved by a mysterious Hunter. Since then, growing peacefully in a village he was brought to, which was like a new home for the survivors of the Great Disaster, Alec dreams about meeting the Hunter again, and becoming a Hunter himself. Together with his best friend Lutz he tries his luck in nearby towns, receiving small Hunter jobs, until the fate crosses the ways of the two young people with a mysterious organization called the Academy. And there their adventure really begins...

The gameplay of this third installment of Arc the Lad series is very similar to that of the predecessor. You fight enemies in turn-based battles, and can move freely on the battlefield, positioning your party members the way you like. You can upgrade your weapons by forging them with special materials, and have a variety of techniques and magic spells at your disposal.</desc>

Using a light gun (or a mouse, if available) you blast your way through the secret base, Area 51, which has been taken over by mutant aliens.

As you work your way to the secrets at the heart of Area 51, you'll need to destroy an increasingly dangerous line of aliens, upgrade your firearm, and cause as much collateral damage as possible. The game rewards the player for destroying windows, light fixtures, computers, explosive barrels, and even fire extinguishers. Each consecutive hit increases your streak rating (which adds to your score) and certain combinations of these collateral hits will open up secret bonus rooms.</desc>

Multi-national companies are lined up at your door, paying you to complete certain objectives, which mainly include the destruction of a certain target or another mech. The more you complete, the better the pay and job offers, therefore allowing you to build the ultimate Armored Core.

Apart from the single player campaign, you can take on a friend in a multiplayer battle. You each control a mech, and battle it out in a large war area (ranging from huge cities to desert planes).</desc>

		<desc>A Raven operating out of Isaac City receives an unusual request. Not only is the request both vague and cryptic, stating simply: "Infiltrate the underground urban complex, Amber Crown,", but it also bypasses normal channels of communication and is sent directly to the Raven in question, without anyone else seeing the message. No sender name or corporate affiliation is mentioned, but the monetary reward promised is massive. Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge. With interest piqued, the Raven climbs into the AC and heads toward Amber Crown.</desc>

		<desc>A long time ago, in a distant galaxy, an alien race was fighting for survival. Over thousands of years, their society had expanded until their home planet could no longer support the population. The only way to continue their civilization was to look to the stars. For many years the aliens searched for another planet that could support life, and just when they were about to give up hope, they discovered a small, green and blue planet in a distant galaxy - it was perfect, almost too good to be true.
 A plan of action was devised and swiftly executed. First they sent some breeding pods, these pods were designed to land on the planet and break open, scattering hundreds of aliens over the area. They would then start to colonize the planet in readiness for the main body of aliens, which would travel at a much slower pace in a gigantic spacecraft.
 These pods landed in a remote part of Siberia and their passengers began to multiply. It was however, not as remote as the bugs had hoped and they found themselves close to a human military base. The bugs waited underground until they were strong and had multiplied sufficiently to take on the humans.
 When the time was right, the decision was made and the bugs attacked the base - to make ready for the arrival of the main hive. They had to move quickly to spread to other parts of Earth.
 The military quickly mobilized against the 'bug' threat, but their conventional forces proved to be useless. Overpowered by the toxins emitted by the new enemy, there was only one thing left, a secret, experimental battle suit, originally developed for use by ground forces in nuclear conflict - it's untested, but it's the only chance. They just need someone brave enough to give it a shot...
			The Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. missions may be played by one or two players. There are also four multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Racewars, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill.</desc>

		<desc>The little plastic army men you played with as a child are toys no longer! They are now living beings bent on destruction. Of course, you get to play an integral role in the conflict as Sarge, a sergeant (you were expecting another rank?) in the Green Army. While your objectives vary with each mission, the goal is to defeat the evil Tan Army using a little strategy and a lot of firepower.

Since you'll also have to confront members of the Blue and Gray armies, you are essentially outnumbered three to one! Roll, duck, kneel, and cycle through your available weapons as you try to complete the objectives detailed at the beginning of each level. Missions range from search-and-destroy to rescue or reconnaissance operations, and you'll even drive one of four vehicles during the battles. Units include versions of six classic toys: Rifle Man, Grenadier, Bazooka Man, Mortar Man, Flamethrower, and Minesweeper.</desc>

		<desc>Arthur! Ready to Race is a racing game based on the Arthur Read aardvark character created by the American children's books writer Marc Tolon Brown. Arthur and his friends need to make the best race cart they can to participate in a big race. The gameplay is very easy and aimed at young children. They can race alone (against the computer) or with friends, and they can be able to solve problems that show up in the game. To create the cart Arthur needs to solve puzzles at the Sugar Bowl and the Pet Shop, and collect Bionic Bunny cards that can be traded in for racing accessories. There are cameo appearances by Arthur's younger sisters (D.W. and Kate Read) and his mother (Mrs. Jane Read) can also be seen.</desc>

		<desc>Assault: Retribution supplies you with some of the best firepower modern technology can provide, as well as various customization options to ensure "better living through quick death disbursement." Washington utilizes a barrage of destructive weaponry such as the P-420 Multi-Phase Pulse Rifle and the aptly named Cutter; Doyle uses a variety of Homing Missiles, Beam Lasers, and the D-16 Magnetic Bolt Accelerator. There's also a plethora of pickups including weapon upgrades, health, ammunition recharges, smart bombs, extra lives, and shields. Save points within each level let you resume the killing when it is most convenient for you. And (rare as of 1999), there is a two-player cooperative mode in case you feel that one ultimate killing machine just isn't enough.

Assault: Retribution is a 3D platform shooting game that takes place across seven futuristic levels, includes two playable characters with alternate routes, analog control, and memory card support. You can't spell action, adrenaline or assault with out an "A," so go out and kick a few!</desc>

		<desc>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved.

Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels.

Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal.

Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake.  Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake.

You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation.  Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris.  The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features.  Each zone has 15 levels.  In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back!  And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids.

There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.  There are also three skill levels.  If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship.  All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace.  There are also limited power-ups you can  pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs.

The game supports either one or two players.  In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level.  You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways....

Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of "Classic Asteroids" now appearing on the main menu.</desc>

		<desc>ATV Mania is an all-terrain vehicle combat racing game. Modes include Championship, Single Race, and Time Attack.

The main mode is the Championship mode which lets the player compete in an underground ATV championship circuit which is being held amongst the French Alps. The player's goal is to win the races by any means necessary.

The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player's vehicle. Examples of weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles.</desc>

The game features a Tournament, Arcade, and Time Trial mode.In tournament mode, players get to choose one of the 10 (8 are selectable from the start and 2 are unlockable) animal racers to race with. The tournament offers three different sets of trophy races; the cross cup, dune cup, and the rock cup. Each cup consists of 3 different racetracks; underground, red rock, and atlantis. These 3 racetracks get altered depending on what cup the player is competing for.When racing, players attempt to beat the five opponents they are up against to the finish line. To help achieve this goal, players can shoot guided rockets, use speed boosts, and lay mines to hinder their opponents. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points they earn. The player with the most points after all the races are done wins the championship cup.Arcade lets the player compete on any of the available tracks so they can practice racing on them. Time Trial lets the player race solo, trying to defeat a track in as little time as possible.Options include setting the difficulty level (easy or medium), setting the number of laps (3, 5, 9 or 50), and whether to turn vibration on or off.

You join an underground organization dedicated to annihilating this cult, and are outfitted with an armed car (customizable to an extent).  The 25 missions vary, from simple search-and-destroy rounds to escort missions and defense missions.</desc>

		<desc>The huge Monster Tower stands near the village Monsbaiya. It is populated by vicious monsters, and few dare enter it. But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower.

You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you assign different commands to them. Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

		<desc>Humongous Entertainment's Backyard Soccer for PlayStation is an animated sports title featuring elementary school-aged cartoon athletes (of both genders) who comprise a soccer team. Single players can compete against the computer, but with the PlayStation Multi-Tap up to four players can take the field in combinations of head-to-head, two-on-two, or three-against-one games. From the kid's clubhouse, players choose to play a single game, a mini-league game, or a tournament game, or to practice making and blocking penalty kicks.
 Several options are available before beginning any game, including the ability to choose the desired team roster, difficulty setting, and playing field, as well as the controller configuration. Players can handpick each member of their team (or select a random team) and also choose the team's name and uniform colors. Prior to and during gameplay, substitutions can be made and players can choose defensive tactics, strategies, and formations. By accessing the team roster, information displays regarding how each chosen character will respond to different strategies.
 Characters can obtain power-ups placed randomly on the field that affect their field goal chances. These include a cannonball that causes a player to shoot the ball so fast that it bursts into flames as it explodes at the back of the goal, a bowling ball that can't be stopped, a twister that turns the ball into a mini-tornado, and an "undergrounder" that causes the ball to tunnel and then resurface on the other side of the goal line. Other options within the game include commentary, action replays, penalty chatter, and referees, all of which can be toggled on or off. Players can also choose between three minute and six minute games. The game records player and team stats during mini league and tournament games.</desc>

		<desc>Four alien species -- the Zaltecs, Thilibies, Mandalars, and Kraytons -- had been at war for a long time. In order to end the bloodshed the aliens signed a treaty that created a new sport, BallBlazer. Once a year, from that day on, each species sends its best rotofoilers to a two-week competition to determine which species is the best. Also, other species have since joined the Interstellar BallBlazer Conference.
			 BallBlazer is similar to one-on-one indoor soccer with weapons. Your main objective is to put the ball into the goal more than your opponent can. Characters ride vehicles called rotofoils that they use to speed around the arenas. In order to win a match you must win two out of three of the 4-minute rounds. To become the champion eight opponents must be defeated.
			 Eight characters are available to choose from and game modes include: practice, tournament, 1-player free play, and 2-player free play. BallBlazer Champions requires one memory block for each saved game.

		<desc>Defend a castle against attacks while laying siege to the enemy with well-placed projectiles in this PS port of the German PC game. A mix of traditional real-time strategy and action puzzle-solving, the basic concept of Ballerburg: Cannons Catapults may remind some older gamers of the early-'90s classic Rampart. The game's story, told tongue-in-cheek, casts players as generals, in charge of the queen's military and based in her castle. War is waged over long distances, with classic siege weapons and powerful magic.
			 The queen's two sisters each have their own armies and fortifications, and the battle will not be finished until only one castle is left standing. As the game progresses, castles collect tax revenue. Generals can use these funds to add new armaments, placing them where they'll do the most damage to the enemy, and also build additional defenses and repair damage that has already been done. Players are ranked according to their performances and may even earn a medal if they are especially successful on the battlefield.
			 Playing like Worms in 3D, or Worms 3D if you like, the idea is to raze your opponent?s castle to the ground through the use of cannons and catapults. These must to be aimed manually while taking wind speeds into consideration, and also need a few seconds to reload at which point both yourself and your enemy are vulnerable. New arsenal can be researched, including triple catapults, while later zeppelins and magic attacks such as thunderstorms become available. There?s a little bit of resource management to take into account as well, with various buildings available to rake in the gold.</desc>

		<desc>Ballistic began life as an arcade game called Time Loop and features elements reminiscent of Bust-A-Move and Battle Balls, though with a decidedly unique style of gameplay. The main goal is to keep balls from reaching the center gate, but instead of aiming at balls that drop from the top of the screen, you shoot at them from a central cannon as they spiral around. The key is to create multiple chain reactions to receive more points.

		<desc>Bass Landing is a fishing game that has a tutorial mode, a free fishing mode, and a B.A.S (Bass Angler's Society) Pro-Tournament mode. In the tutorial mode, players go to fishing classes and learn and practice the basics of fishing starting with casting all the way down to bass ecology. At the end of all the classes the player is given an exam testing them on all they have previously learned. Free fishing mode let's the player fish at their leisure, letting them choose from 5 different lakes and setting its' conditions to their liking, and let's them attempt to catch any of the 14 species of fish that inhabit those lakes. The B.A.S Pro-Tournament mode has the player competing in 7 different tournaments by catching a set number of the most heaviest bass in a set amount of time.

Before heading out to fish the player can choose their type of rod, reel, lure, and line. When fishing the player chooses the way to cast their line, use a power meter to determine how far out the line is cast, and then hope to lure a fish on to their hook.

Options in the game let the player decide things such as the time scale, rod action, and indicator type. Their is also a record option that keeps track of all the data about the various fish that have been caught in the free fishing and tournament modes. The player can also save replays of the catches that they deem to be noteworthy.</desc>

		<desc>In Bass Rise you can catch three kinds of fish: largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, and bluegill. Aside from catching fish, the motivation to continue playing comes from collecting more lures (hundreds in all) and finding new fishing locations: lakes, canals, docksides, etc.
			 Tying the game together are story sequences featuring other anglers who offer advice and challenges, such as catching a set number of fish in five casts. In addition, the game sports a multiplayer contest mode that supports up to four players - but they don't compete at the same time, which deadens the appeal a bit. Instead, each player gets a fixed number of chances to cast and haul in a fish - and the largest catch wins.

 The look of the game is based on the animated series rather than the comic book or movies. Arkham Asylum's security has let Batman down once again as a number of major criminals have escaped and are back on the streets of Gotham City.
 Players will have to scour the city in search of Penguin, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Two-Face, Mr. Freeze, the Riddler, and Joker. Modes of play include a patrol mode where players freely drive around looking for action and an adventure mode where Batman tackles 40 episode-based missions.</desc>

		<desc>Batman Forever - The Arcade Game is a Final-Fight/Double-Dragon style game which features the Caped Crusader and his sidekick Robin in a traditional beat-em-up. Based on the Batman Forever movie, this side-scrolling beat-em-up features the plot, several memorable characters, and quotes from its movie counterpart.

		<desc>Battle Arena Toshinden is a fighting game for the PlayStation. It was one of the first fighting games to boast polygonal characters in a 3D battle arena, rather than the traditional side-to-side fighting space that had been popular since Street Fighter II.

		<desc>Himitsu Kessha founded the Toshinden--held annually, these tournaments feature strong combatants from all around the world. After the established corporation found out a nonsanctioned tournament was held by Gaia, they began organizing another Toshinden; their motivations are to lure the rebel to the tournament and have him slain for his insolence.
			Thus is the premise behind Battle Arena Toshinden 2, the sequel to the PlayStation's first rotational, 360-degree 3D fighting game. Featuring characters from the original, there are eleven fighters in all, including Eiji Shinjo, Kayin Amoh, Tracy, Chaos, and Duke B. Rambert; characters feature their own arenas, moves, combinations, weapons, and special attacks. Additionally, there is a mysterious bonus character waiting to be unlocked and two bosses to fight.
			There are a few game play options including the one player, full battle, and versus modes. Whereas the one player mode will have you battling against eight computer-controlled opponents, the full battle option throws you into a heated tournament of 10 characters--not including the bosses. The versus mode is selectable at any time, as long as you have access to a secondary controller; here you'll fight against a human opponent.

		<desc>Battlestations doesn't mess around with fancy storylines or deep, involving mission objectives; instead, it focuses all its energy in two players blowing the smithereens out of each other on open water! Either two human players or a computer-controlled opponent can play a barrage of different war games set throughout different game play options.
			 With a total of seventy-six action-packed missions (both single-player and multiplayer combined), game play options include the Arcade, Campaign, and War Games modes. The Arcade mode offers a no-frills ship-to-ship war simulation between you and an opponent. With the overall objective to become Fleet Admiral, players will earn points for sinking their opponent's ships and progress through ten different naval rankings.
			 Campaign pits man versus computer in a variety of single-player missions. Mission objectives include search and destroy operations, seeking out lost crew members, mobilizing and deploying various fleets and ships, and spine tingling one-on-one battleship rumbles. There are five different enemy commanders each with his or her own unique skills and weaknesses; Rear Admiral Evelyn Kennedy is terrifically skilled in all areas while Ballast is a patient and methodical opponent, eventually exploiting your own strategies.</desc>

		<desc>Battlesport simulates the sport of the future. Choose your vehicle and enter the arena to face your computer opponents to see who scores the most goals before the clock runs out.

Scoring isn't easy. The ball constantly bounces over the arena, retrieved by a player constantly bombarded by opponents. A variety of weapons are available to shoot your competitor, and anyone that takes a hit while carrying the ball loses possession, sending the ball bouncing across the arena. Taking too many shots results in a temporary inability to take part in the action while your opponent happily scores goals. 

Winning matches increases standing in the rankings and the acquisition of cash to purchase a better vehicle and enhanced offensive or defensive items.</desc>

		<desc>BattleTanx: Global Assault makes its PlayStation debut with more levels than the earlier Nintendo 64 version. Split-screen multiplayer support is also included, but for two players instead of four. The fast-paced action involves motoring across grid-like environments in one of 13 well-outfitted tanks. Solo players can complete 40 search-and-destroy missions in the campaign mode, while up to two friends can blast each other to scrap metal in seven deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and tag variants. Twenty power-ups are available in total, ranging from cloaking and teleporting devices to plasma bolts and guided missiles. Featured levels take place in futuristic versions of San Francisco, Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin, all of which are home to ruthless, tank-driving gangs.

Prior to the game's beginning, Griffin Spade set about reclaiming his lost love and establishing his tribe in San Francisco. But the peace he'd blasted out for himself looks to be short-lived as he's having frequent nightmares about a sinister QueenLord. It's up to Griffin to mount up again and with all the finesse that a giant tank can muster and solve the mystery behind this evil woman. And so the stage is set for Battle Tanx: Global Assault.</desc>

Avoid bugs, insects, and bad weather as you try to outwit the big one in Free Fishing mode, Beat-the-Clock challenges, 2-Day Lunker, and 3-Day All Release contests, or the ultimate 3-Day Tournament. Unlock new locations via 15-minute timed events featuring goals such as catching two fish of any type, or reeling in two or three largemouth, smallmouth, or spotted bass of at least seven pounds in separate challenges.
			 Arcade mode requires you to catch five fish in five minutes, with an additional 90 seconds added for each one caught, and each time five fish are netted, you automatically move to a new location. Fourteen species of freshwater fish can be hooked, including multiple types of bass, bluegill, and more, in a dozen locations based in two lakes, a river, and a reservoir. The only fisherman in the game is a woman and you have no interactive control over boat movement.
			 Gameplay consists of choosing the best of a wide selection of lures for each situation, casting, and reeling in the fish while using optional gauges that indicate line tension, fish interest, and the effectiveness of the lure. Two camera angles offer perspectives from behind the angler in the boat or underwater from a fish-eye view, and you can track the top catches of each type of fish in each event via the game's record section.</desc>

		<desc>Big Strike Bowling offers a light-hearted look at the popular sport of bowling by mixing a wide array of fanciful characters (all customizable) and four venues (classical lanes, tropical beach setting, cosmic atmosphere, and a back-alley alley) with real-world physics. Players make adjustments to the curving arc of the ball prior to delivery, bowler position, speed, and power as they compete in four types of gameplay: Open Game, Team Game, Progressive Play and Tournament. The tournament pits the player's bowler in a bracket consisting of 32 opponents, with a "sudden death" roll-off provided in case of a tie in the final game.
			 Players use money earned by winning tournament games to purchase bowling accessories and items, such as shoes, shirts, pants, and ball covers, as well as to unlock other bowlers and secrets. Player stats, including average, high game, earnings (from progressive and tournament games), percentage of strikes and spares per game, and number of wins and losses, can be saved. Even though the characters are exaggerated and the settings somewhat improbable, action in Big Strike Bowling presents believable challenges ranging from savvy competition to the ignominy of fouling at the line.</desc>

Set in an apocalyptic future, the freaks have the ability to fight with combos and fire machine guns and missile launchers. The block action can also elicit a full body shield that protects you from bullets and other projectiles. A nice twist in Bio F.R.E.A.K.S is that you can fight on land and in the air with the typical Mortal Kombat/SteetFighter button combinations (two punch, two kick) while implementing two side step buttons and a fire button (for your weapon).
			 The huge, lethal (a flame pit, lava, and giant rollers) environments allow for full 3D movement either in the air or on the ground. Bio F.R.E.A.K.S also offers an option to 'turn-off' the gore and blood, and options to turn off the shield, flight, and fire capabilities for a more traditional fighting game. Beyond the arcade mode, Bio F.R.E.A.K.S also offers a survival, team, versus, and practice mode for more replay value!</desc>

		<desc>BLACK BASS WITH BLUE MARLIN brings the joys of the lake and the sea to the PlayStation. You won't miss a second of the action with a wide variety of camera angles. For those who want an arcade feel, choose the underwater camera and watch that fish fight; the above-water view provides a simulation experience, where the fish is unknown until it is brought in. Don't worry, bringing in the fish is not going to be a problem with the large number of spots to drop a line. Naturally, dropping the line is not going to be enough; you'll have to choose lures wisely and use the proper technique if you want to catch anything. If you're not having any luck, get advice about your technique from legendary angler, Hank Parker. With all of the options and a large number of fishing spots, BLACK BASS WITH BLUE MARLIN has something for every aspiring angler.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 1998 and terrorist activity is rampant. All efforts for peace have failed. With no peaceful end in sight, the U.S. Government has funded a top secret Black Operations military group to attack and destroy the terrorists and rescue any hostages. Black Dawn puts you in control of a combat helicopter, the Agile Warrior: F-IIIX, with two flight modes, six views, and thirty-two missions to blast through. Everything else is on a need-to-know basis. A saved game requires one memory block.
			 Black Dawn fulfills a few childhood dreams by putting gamers in control of a military helicopter. Terrorists have grown powerful in the world and it is up to you to restore stability and peace throughout the lands. Assigned to a variety of campaigns, you must fly the AH-69 Mohawk (sounds like something Jan-Michael Vincent from AIRWOLF would pilot) as you battle through enemy territory across different global locales.</desc>

		<desc>With assistance from his friend and mentor Abraham Whistler, Blade has vowed to rid the world of all vampires. As Blade and in later missions Abraham Whistler, you must traverse foreboding towers, buildings and streets in an effort to cleanse the world of evil.
			 Played from a third-person perspective, Blade involves fighting a variety of enemies including vampires, henchmen, militia soldiers, police, attack hounds, zombies and SWAT soldiers. Vanquishing your enemies involves using one of the following five weapons: a double-edged Japanese sword, handgun, shotgun, the Multi-Launcher and Machine Pistol.
			 In order to use these items, however, ammunition must be obtained. There are four kinds including standard, carbon, explosive and silver. To help determine which ammo is appropriate for a particular enemy, you can check their color-based genetic makeup. Yellow represents a monster, green is human, while red represents a vampire.

You're being prepared for The Game, an unknown competition between rival stables. You've been excluded from society for one simple reason: the spectator sport known as Blast Chamber. Owned by the stable's manager, you're fresh meat in a highly dangerous sport involving fast-paced action and life ending explosions. Should you claim victory, you may have a shot at freedom...
			Blast Chamber features sixty levels set throughout rotational 3D chambers. As the chamber moves, the floor becomes a wall and the walls turn into ceilings and floors. The objective of each level is to obtain the crystal within the allotted time and before your competition to progress to the next chamber and avoid a rather gruesome death.

He didn't count on a young man named Jason, a beautiful alien woman named Eve, and their battle tank, the Sofia MA-01...because of his underestimation, the Plutonium Boss was defeated.

Since then, Jason had been defending the Earth from any threat that arises, with Eve by his side. She even bore him two children, Roddy and Elfie. Jason trained Elfie in engineering, and Roddy in battling in Sofia. But now Jason and Eve have died, and Roddy must take his father's place as defender of the Earth.

And an old threat seems to be arising to challenge this new generation of heroes...</desc>

		<desc>Blockids for PlayStation is a 3D take on the arcade classic Breakout. Players choose one of eight animated characters and prepare to compete against an assortment of colorful opponents whose fortresses must be breached. The object is to break a series of bricks by smashing a ricocheting ball into them using a horizontal paddle.
 The default view is presented from an angled top-down perspective, but players can switch to a perspective right behind the paddle for a more 3D feel. New twists on the classic gameplay include the ability to bounce the ball over barriers as well as earn a special power-up by scoring a certain number of points.
 Level progress and high scores during the game can be saved to memory card, with mouse support also available for precision sliding movement.</desc>

There are nine initially selectable characters with two more waiting to be found.
			The Arcade mode offers a no-frills competition against the computerized AI. If players get bored with the Arcade mode, a second player can join in the action or select the Versus option -- a two-player brawl. Survival mode tests to see how many opponents a player can beat without getting knocked out. In the Story mode, the real draw of Bloody Roar II, each character comes with his or her own unique scenario. By winning rounds, the story unfurls and resolves after the final conflict.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay in Bomberman Party Edition represents something of a return to the classic Bomberman style of play. There aren't a lot of extra hoops to jump through, just a lot of things to blow up. The idea is basic; make your way around the board and explode as much stuff as you can. Of course as in the original, lots of power-ups are available to add to the excitement and bring new strategic considerations into the mix. A single-player "story mode" is available, but the most significant advance in this version of the classic game is that it allows up to five players to compete at once. 
 The "Battle Royal Mode" allows competitors to challenge one another in the classic Bomberman setting and a "Custom Battle Mode" let's players tweak the options and settings to their liking. As frantic as a good single-player game of Bomberman can be, five people playing on the same screen can increase the frenzy exponentially.
 Features:
 Play alone through 50 stages or compete with friends in "Battle Royal" or "Custom Battle"
 Take on a variety of monsters with their own abilities and personality
 Defeat your enemies in various single-and tag-team battles</desc>

		<desc>Many games claim it, but few actually deserve the mantle of 'Classic', but for many, Bomberman was one of the all-time great multi-player games due to its frenetic energy and basic simplicity - just blow up your opponent before he can get you!
			The game features no less than twelve multi-player stages with three modes of battle play: single match, Tag Team and Maniac mode. Others modes include Normal (single player story) and challenge mode, but the real Bomberman fanatics have no doubtably been waiting to play the game's five-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Clown World is in trouble. Mysterious blue bombs have appeared all over the planet, and King Clown needs help. In a royal decree, the king beckons for Kid Clown, a hero of past Kemco games, to clean up these bombs in all six continents. The strange, yet brave little clown sets out to blast the bombs away before the planet explodes.

Clearing these bombs will not always be easy, as they have been arranged in puzzles across 60 different levels. Kid Clown must act wisely, because each level has only one igniter bomb that can detonate the bombs surrounding it. To successfully complete a level in one try, Kid Clown must arrange the bombs so that a chain reaction takes place. He also has to get a safe distance away from the reaction or he will explode.</desc>

		<desc>Konami's third installment of their PlayStation baseball series adds several new features to distinguish itself from previous titles. The game now offers 30 different stadiums, new motion-captured animations, a Scenario mode with 20 different game situations to complete, and both the Opening Day rosters and Interleague schedule for 1998.
			 While Bottom of the 9th '99 does not feature a Major League Baseball license for authentic team names and logos, you do get over 700 MLBPA players with signature styles and ratings based on the 1997 season. A play-by-play announcer will call the action as soon as the first pitch is thrown.
			 The six game modes include Exhibition, Season (adjustable from 15 to a full 162 games), Scenario, Training, Playoffs and World Championship. Other notable features are one-for-one trades, four difficulty levels, defensive shifts, errors, substitutions, wind, day or night games, and custom starting rosters. Batting still relies on a cursor system to hit, although players can set it to a "locked" position to make tracking the ball easier.</desc>

		<desc>Konami's Bottom of the 9th is the first baseball game on the PlayStation to use polygonal players. Batting and pitching relies on aiming cursors, which can be "locked-on" to make things easier for novices. The game has an MLBPA license for real players from the 1995 season, but no Major League Baseball affiliation, so teams are listed by city name only.
			Eight fictional stadiums are also available, and a complete season along with statistical tracking can be saved to memory card. Don't want to play a complete season? No problem, the schedule can be shortened to 13, 26 or 52 games. Training Camp mode allows you work on your pitching, hitting, fielding or running skills, and a General Manager mode lets you perform trades. An announcer will keep things lively by calling the action from the booth.</desc>

			A simulation of the classic game of the same name. As you can imagine from the name, this is a no-frills game, but it still comes with three modes, (normal, special, and quest) and multiplayer options. (1-4 players, with computer players as desired.)
			Normal mode is the regular bowling game, but special mode sets up 45 pins instead of the usual 10. Quest mode, on the other hand, randomly places 3 pins in the lane, creating a more strategic play.</desc>

Only the basic objective remains the same: maneuvering a paddle to keep a ball in play so it can ricochet off a wall of bricks (or other items in this case), effectively eliminating the bricks from the playfield.
			The Breakout world of 2000 is an island filled with bizarre creatures in the form of paddles and balls. Bouncer enjoys his life their with Daisy, his beautiful girlfriend. All was fine in paradise until one day when Bouncer took a swim out to sea to rescue a ball. While Bouncer was gone, the evil Batnix and his henchmen kidnapped Daisy.

		<desc>Capcom's third installment of its epic RPG. Breath of Fire III is the first installment of the Breath of Fire Series to appear on the Playstation (And later ported to the PSP). 

Set free by the the workers of Dauna Mine, Ryu of the Brood learns to both understand his power, and to understand the history of his extinct kind. By both utilizing Ryu's unique power and the abilities of those whom assist him, players will uncover the history of the Brood, learn more about the characters, and the very reason why the Brood were wiped out.

Players control Ryu and his allies on their journey, each of Ryu's friends have abilities only they can use, and they will have to work together to make their way through the obstacles and enemies that they encounter; creativity is key to your success in this game!

Ryu eventually is able to utilize his power of the Brood, allowing him to ascend into various dragon-like forms. This is done using a gene-splicing system that dictates what sort of form Ryu will take.

Breath of Fire III also includes a Master System, which permits Ryu and his allies to learn from various people to augment their abilities differently as they gain experience; these trainers can also teach abilities to those whom train hard under them.</desc>

Flying through the sky on their sandflier, Nina and Cray are attacked by a worm shaped dragon. With their vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy. Meanwhile, the ancient Emperor Fou Lu awakens from his slumber in his tomb. His plan is to return to the world of human, conquer it anew, and impose his iron rule on it...

This fourth installment of the  Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the  previous game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for "masters" living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series, has retained the series' trademark gameplay element: the ability to turn into a dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types, including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous installments as well.</desc>

			In the following year of 215, he assassinated King Henguist, Almekia's widely loved ruler. With the fallen king lying at his feet, Zemeckis proclaimed himself the new emperor and began a dynasty of terror. With a lust of hate in his eyes, the new ruler named his conquered land as the Esgares Empire and unleashed brutal assaults on the neighboring countries located in Forsena.
			Zemeckis didn't account for the Knights of the Rune, however. Born with magical runic abilities, these warriors are looking to police Forsena from the evil tyrant's wrath. And although it will be an uphill battle against armies of monsters and elite warriors, the knights have vowed to succeed!</desc>

		<desc>Broken Helix puts you in the boots of an armed marine of a special forces team.  You are sent in to a military base which has been taken over by terrorists for unknown reasons.

The main character is voiced by Bruce Campbell, star of the Evil Dead movies.  Throughout the game, he makes wisecracks and one-liners, and dialogue with personnel is generally comical.

Broken Helix is considered a 4D game.  For example, if you are on the third floor, you may have to make your way up to the fifth floor in order to defuse a bomb.  There is no visible time limit, but if you do not make it up to that floor in time, the bomb will go off, and you will die.

There are various objectives to complete, such as disarming bombs and finding certain items, but the game is mostly action/adventure, searching for keys to open doors.

In order to be successful, you must sneak past cameras and other devices, in order to find out the truth behind the terrorist takeover.</desc>

Circle of Blood is the first part in the Broken Sword series. It is a third-person puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure game with 2D cartoon-like graphics.

		<desc>Bowling. A sport that depends more on talent and raw wrist power than actual physical conditioning. A sport that can be so laid back that there's even a section of it that involves buying beer. While THQ can't bring you a six-pack when you throw a strike on the seventh frame, it does manage to deliver an extremely realistic bowling title, complete with some of the best big-money bowlers in the world today.
			 You have the opportunity to create your own bowler or choose one of the 13 Brunswick Pro Staff bowlers. But be warned because these bowlers are tough stuff and will tell you right away that they own the alley.
			 With different gameplay modes to choose from, you can select Exhibition to get going quickly, or a Skins game for big money. There's also tournament mode, career mode and cosmic bowling, which turn the lane into a discotheque. The lane's realistically oiled, which forces you to move around the lane and change your rolls as the conditions change.

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is an arcade game by Taito, first released in 1986 and later ported to numerous home computers and game consoles. The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons Bub and Bob, is an action-platform game in which players travel through one hundred different stages, blowing and bursting bubbles, avoiding enemies and collecting a variety of items. The game became very popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob's girlfriends from big wind-up toasters, among other enemies. It is also notable for being an early example of a game with multiple endings, which depended on the player's skill and discovering secrets.
			 One or two players attempt to save their friends in this re-release of the 1987 classic puzzle/action game. Players blow bubbles to trap enemies. When they pop the bubbles, fruit comes out and the players compete for the points. If they don't pop the bubbles in time, the enemies escape and become faster.</desc>

		<desc>Bubsy 3D: Furbitten Planet, also known simply as Bubsy 3D, is a platform video game developed by Eidetic and published by Accolade and Telstar for the PlayStation video game console. Designed by Michael Berlyn, it was released on October 13, 1996 in North America and in August 1997 in Europe. It is the fourth and final game in the Bubsy series, starring its eponymous protagonist. It is one of the first 3D platform games, though with limited movement. The game's complete name is a parody of Forbidden Planet, a 1956 sci-fi film. A Sega Saturn version was planned but was cancelled.
			 The game was very poorly received and was regarded as one of the worst games of all time by GameTrailers, IGN, GamesRadar, and humorist Seanbaby. Many of the major elements of the game received criticism; it has been criticized for its graphics, its controls, and the personality of Bubsy, the latter which IGN felt was ruined from the previous Bubsy games. It holds an aggregate score of 50.90% at Game Rankings based on five reviews. Berlyn attributes its low quality to its release coinciding with Super Mario 64, which he found to be far superior; however, due to development being nearly done and Accolade wanting it to be released, there was no time to improve upon it.</desc>

Not just any race, but a race in which the participants ride on giant bugs. Choose from 22 different contestants, each with unique racing styles and weapon, and try to be the first to the finish line on six tracks. If finishing first is a little too tough, make your bug go faster by using your riding crop. But be careful, or your bug will quit running for you. For those looking for a less-than-honest way to win, collect power-ups and weapons scattered throughout the track to blow past your opponents or blast them out of the sky. And don't forget to keep your eyes open for the shortcuts in each track. Do you have the nerve and the skill to win the Great Race? Play BUG RIDERS: The Race of Kings and find out.</desc>

It seems Bugs inadvertently activated a time machine before he could kick back and catch some rays on Pismo Beach, so he's now trapped in another dimension!
			Bugs Bunny: Lost in Time has players traveling through the following eras: The Stone Age, The Medieval Times, The Pirate Years, The 1930s, and Dimension X. Your goal in this loony adventure is to collect a certain number of clocks hidden on each level. These clocks will then enable you to access additional levels within each time period. Besides clocks, Bugs can find carrots to replenish energy, golden carrots to access secret levels, and red ACME boxes. Break all of the boxes on each level to reveal an additional clock!</desc>

Once you have made a building, you can eliminate it by shooting a block on the corner of it. The larger the building, the more benefits you'll reap when you destroy it!
 The game can be played three different ways: Puzzle mode, Battle mode, and Arcade mode. In the Puzzle mode, you must travel to one of seven different courses and construct specific size buildings. You must not destroy the buildings in this mode. The object is to build cities for the specific course or region you're in and make the cities grow.</desc>

There are three different courses to drive on (a wooded area, city streets and snow area) and also have a reverse track variation that can be unlocked.  The object is not only to finish ahead of opponents, but also cross checkpoints in order to add more time to the ever depleting timer at the top of the screen.

There are three different difficulty levels and three different game modes: Practice lets the player choose a track and races several different opponents and Career where the player races in a series of multi-heat events.  In these heat events, each time a lap is completed the driver that is last place is eliminated until only one car finishes the race.  The final mode is a multiplayer that allows two friends to battle against each other utilizing the Playstation Link Cable.

There are also a multitude of camera angles including first and third person along with a full replay mode that shows the race in its entirety.</desc>

		<desc>Bust-A-Move 2 is a puzzle game that involves clearing or "popping" groups of bubbles by creating matches of three or more. A pointing device at the bottom of the screen is used to aim and launch a randomly generated bubble toward others of the same color. Since launched bubbles can ricochet off walls, the challenge comes from estimating the angle you'll need to create potential matches.
			 Clear each stage before the ceiling reaches the screen's bottom and you'll safely advance. Challenge the computer or a friend to a split-screen, simultaneous match; test your aiming skills in a series of 130 puzzle levels; or race to clear screens as quickly as possible with the time attack option. The Bust-A-Move series is also known as Puzzle Bobble outside the U.S.
			 Features:
			 Compete against a variety of colorful computer opponents in best-of-three matches
			 Complete 30 rounds of pre-defined challenges in the Puzzle Game
			 Challenge a friend to a split-screen, bubble-popping showdown with custom options</desc>

		<desc>Comprising three titles, (Buster Bros., Super Buster Bros., and Buster Buddies), Buster Bros. Collection is a compilation of Capcom's "Buster" arcade series -- released over a period of six years from 1989 to 1995. Gameplay presents a blend of puzzle and action that sees players strafing from side-to-side, shooting vertically at the bubbles that bounce around the arena. Enclosed within the confines of a single, 2D arena, one or two players must utilize their rope-gun devices to destroy the deluge of bubbles that inundate the screen. When hit, the bubbles burst into multiple, smaller segments, and will continue to do so until the smallest bubble is destroyed. Only by clearing the screen can players proceed. However, coming into contact with a bubble will result in the immediate loss of a life.</desc>

		<desc>Another in a long-running series of Contra games, C: The Contra Adventure takes place in the jungles of South America. A meteor from outer space has landed near a Mayan temple, killing hundreds of natives and destroying acres and acres of crops. The once placid temple is now occupied by aliens. Contra Force member Tanya has been sent in for advance intelligence, but she's missing in action. As Ray, former member of the elite Contra Force, you must come out of retirement and battle these forces alone.
			Although equipped with a huge arsenal of weapons of destruction, including a shatter gun, grenades, rockets, super bombs, and an ever-present machine gun, Ray will have his hands full combating hoards of enemies such as snipers, alien soldiers, tanks, UFOs, and spiked slugs in 9 levels of running, jumping, climbing, and shooting 2D and 3D action.</desc>

		<desc>Prolific on the PC platform, Activision's Cabela's line brings virtual hunting to the hardy PlayStation console for the first time with this release. Gameplay is designed to recreate the full hunting experience, requiring sense, skill, and sportsmanship. Authenticity is enhanced by accoutrements such as maps, vehicles, and Cabela's brand hunting gear.
			 The game's two career programs let hunters demonstrate their talents in a series of competitions for deer, elk, and other prey, or help the Department of Natural Resources to keep the wolf and bear population in check. A special X-Ray Mode even allows the virtual hunter to see through to the internal organs of his or her target, to line up the best shot for a quick, clean kill. Adjustable skill settings help provide a worthy challenge for players of varied experience.</desc>

Six firearms and two bows are available in this hunting sim, as well as other important equipment. Virtual outdoorsmen can enter the "Mission" or "Quick Hunt" modes of play to track down Whitetail, Blacktail, Fallow Deer, Sitka Deer, Desert Mule, or Rocky Mountain Mule deer through one of six areas of varied terrain. Animals are designed with artificial intelligence particular to each species. A day and night cycle and various weather conditions affect the hunt and add to the realism.
			 Cabela's Ultimate Deer Hunt: Open Season, developed by Coresoft Games, is roughly based on the original 2001 PC game by nFUSION Interactive, but features a few different hunting locations and weapons</desc>

		<desc>Caesars Palace attempts to capture all the essences of Las Vegas gambling by incorporating popular games and visuals found in the aforementioned city. In many ways, it's a simulation -- the rules of each game were taken directly from those found in Vegas (circa 1997) as well as the cash payoffs, sounds, and odds of winning. Likewise, each table and game has been modeled after their real-life counterparts to give the look and feel of being in an actual casino.
			 From the signpost in the lobby, you can pick which game you want to play. There are five games in all -- blackjack, craps, roulette, baccarat, and the slot machine. If you're not sure how to play baccarat, you can choose to view a tutorial -- an official Caesars Palace video. Each game (with the exception of the slot machine) features an instructional movie and by watching them, you may pick up some pointers for winning.</desc>

In addition to the standard blackjack and roulette games, there is a variety of new slot machines and poker challenges in this 1998 update of Caesars Palace. Each machine has been modeled after their real-life counterparts and include Gridiron, 4th of July, Pirate's Gold, King's Ransom, Classic Progressive, and Classic Bars. Additionally, there are now Hold 'Em and Stud challenges located in the poker lounge.
			 Much like the original, players create their on-screen persona and enter the casino. From the lobby, you can borrow money from the cashier or progress to higher table limits. Money is only borrowed unless you have insufficient funds to gamble -- less than one hundred dollars. Because your character is a gambling newbie, the higher-up tables are only available once a certain dollar amount is met.</desc>

		<desc>Total Drivin is a racing game with five different classes of cars (4x4 Buggies, Dakar Rally, Sports, Indy and Rally) in six different locations (Moscow, Easter Island, Scotland, Hong Kong, Egypt and Switzerland). Each location has six different tracks to master with a total of 36 tracks. The different tracks actually are variations of the same track only slightly different. For example drive with different car type, reverse direction, ramps added or safety rails removed, different weather conditions etc.

You can choose to drive with 1 of 8 different teams, each with different driving behaviour, providing 40 cars in total. There is multiplayer for 2 to 4 players, using split-screen and a link cable. The game also features typical 1990's rave music.

When your car rolls over the game will turn you right side up again, but if your car drives into water or falls into lava the game instantly ends.</desc>

 Casino mode starts you out with a small amount of chips and the goal of winning enough cash to purchase items at the shop. Merchandise includes new background music, access to higher stakes tables, and most importantly, furnishings for your room. When the game begins, your room is empty, but as you earn money you are able to buy a variety of products such as wallpaper, carpet and TVs. Your winnings and all merchandise purchased are saved on the memory card at the end of each session.
 In Free mode, you receive more money, can choose from 14 different CPU opponents, and play against another human player. Rules and instructions for each game are contained in the Manual mode.</desc>

		<desc>For decades, the clans of Bloodland were locked in a never-ending war; then the Wanderer arrived with the Book of Knowledge. He divided the book and gave each clan a piece, hoping the clans would come to rely on each other's newly acquired knowledge. The Wanderer left and the clans, hoping to reassemble the book, returned to their old ways. 

That is when Syn appeared. She turned the pieces of the book into weapons and organized a tournament of the clans' warriors. Whoever wins the tournament will control the Book of Knowledge and become the ruler of Bloodland.

Choose one of 20 characters, each with unique combos and weapons, and battle your way through the tournament. If the tournament is too much for you, practice your moves or fight in the Survival or Team Battle modes. Do you have what it takes to become the ruler of Bloodland? 

A gory one-on-one fighting game, set within a series of semi-free-roaming enviroments.</desc>

The robots, called Overkill Engines (OKEs), cannot be directly controlled in battle; they must be programmed beforehand to behave in a certain way under certain conditions using a flow diagram system.
			 GAMEPLAY:
			 The game also features a fairly complex negotiation system that allows the player to purchase, research, or upgrade new equipment and parts. The OKEs themselves can be upgraded as well through this system, allowing for extended use of the same model for as long as possible. The various companies involved in the negotiation process can also provide valuable information about the purchases of the enemy, allowing the player to better plan for the next advancement in enemy technology.

This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.</desc>

		<desc>Three-time AMA Champion Ricky Carmichael lends his good name and experience to Championship Motocross 2001. The game actually features 28 riders in all, competing on over two-dozen different tracks. There are also a few different modes of play in Championship Motocross 2001 featuring Ricky Carmichael. The free-style mode puts players on an open track designed for tricks, allowing them the chance to perfect the "signature moves" of some of the game's licensed riders.
			 The career mode of play requires skill at the bargaining table as well as on the track, as players shop for equipment and negotiate with sponsors. The Create-a-Rider feature allows players to customize their character's appearance and ability. While remaining true to the fundamentals of the sport, Championship Motocross 2001 features a more "arcade-style" of play that focuses on fun.

		<desc>This motocross game offers 9 customizable dirt bikes in three categories: 125cc, 250cc and 250cc. The six main modes include championship, split-screen head-to-head, single races and time attack modes. There are 12 tracks available and these have been divided into motocross, supercross and endure tracks, both indoor and outdoor, with different surfaces. On top of that, each course can also be reversed. An additional touch is added by dynamic weather effects. Each bike, with different performances, can be fully tuned based on suspension, brakes, gears, tires... If racing for the finish line is not enough, you can also perform stunts with the trick system to wow the spectators. As the game's title implies, you are able to race as or against motocross star Ricky Carmichael.</desc>

		<desc>Championship Surfer is developed by a team consisting of some avid surfers, plus they have received assistance by Australian National Surfing Champion Mark "Richo" Richardson. Eight members of the O'Neill World Championship surf team will appear in the game including Cory Lopez, Shane Beschen, and Rochelle Ballard.
			 The in-game waves, which will swell, curl, and break just like the real thing, were created using Krome Studios' own 3D game engine called Merkury. More than 30 surf boards are selectable and there are seven modes of play featured, such as Championship, Arcade, Rumble, and Training.

		<desc>Based on the popular computer chess program, The Chessmaster 3-D for the PlayStation allows players to challenge a friend or one of 12 virtual chess opponents. Each computer-controlled opponent is rated according to ability. There are also six unique chess sets (each with animated pieces) from which to choose, including Alphabet, Celestial, Deco, Mechanical, Modern, and Staunton.
 If you need assistance in deciding which pieces to move in order to secure a checkmate, the ChessMaster is available to lend a helping hand. You can perfect your chess playing skills using various teaching options; you can even view the computer's thought process as it "thinks" through each move.
 While this is obviously a 3D title, you can switch the camera angle for a more traditional two-dimensional perspective. The camera is adjustable in that you're able to zoom it in and out until you find a view that is to your liking. You can even switch playing sides (from black to white pieces or vise versa) or simply have a quick look at the other side of the board.
 If you want to see which pieces have been captured, you can view them in the War Room. The Chessmaster 3-D also features various time controls (five seconds per move, 40 moves in 120 minutes), replays, take back options, and auto play (which lets the game play itself).
 Features:
 Challenge the computer or a friend on a 3D table with adjustable levels of zoom
 Features 12 computer AI opponents
 Access hints while playing and view replays of key moves</desc>

Instead, they have driven into the racing spotlight to give the Mario Kart and Diddy Kong Racing titles a run for their money.
			Along with the loveable Chocobo, Mog makes a glorious return to videogame action. For those unfamiliar with the character, the white-furred critter made his debut in Final Fantasy VI (released as Final Fantasy III on American shores) for the Super Nintendo. Together, they set off on a grand adventure looking for pieces of the legendary Blue Crystal. In order to obtain the pieces, they must defeat other wacky racers including the Chubby Chocobo, White Mage, Behemoth, and more (eight in all).</desc>

		<desc>Following the adventures of the first Chocobo Dungeon game, Chocobo and Mog continue to search for treasure. One day, Mog discovers a new Mysterious Dungeon and takes the treasure from inside. This releases a seal which causes the Bahamut to appear just as the dungeons plunges into the ocean. Chocobo is rescued by a young white mage, Shiroma, who is the only human living in the monster village. Chocobo must help Mog, find Bahamut and fix whatever has been unsealed from the Mysterious Dungeon.

Chocobo's Dungeon 2 is a simple action / rpg in the style of other games in the  Mysterious Dungeon series. Chocobo must decend into dungeon areas alone or with a partner (controlled by the cpu or the second player), gathering treasure, while finding the passageway to the next floor and satisfying hunger. The game is viewed from the top down as all objects on the screen move at the same time. Chocobo can equip a single weapon and armor item, while the hunger level is satisfied by eating different forms of nuts. Spells can be collected, while successive casting increases the proficiency in that spell. Unlike other Mysterious Dungeon games, Chocobo keeps his level and stats between trips to the dungeon. Boss monsters wait at the completion of most objectives. Different subquests are available from the residents of Monster Town.</desc>

		<desc>Chrono Cross is a sequel to the SNES RPG  Chrono Trigger.

The main character is Serge, a young boy from a fishing village. One day, while strolling on the sea shore with his sweetheart, Serge suddenly disappears. He comes back to senses several moments later. Everything seems just the same as it was before, but when Serge visits his home village, nobody recognizes him. He hears from people that he has been dead for ten years. Serge begins to realize that he is now in a parallel world. His first and only wish is to find a way to return home, but, in order to do that, he must understand what has caused the existence of parallel words, allowing inter-dimensional travel. His quest will also reveal to him the truth about his own existence, and connect the seemingly unrelated plot of Chrono Cross to that of Chrono Trigger.

Chrono Cross is a Japanese RPG with turn-based battles. There are no random battles; enemies are always visible on screen. There are also no character levels in the game; instead, characters get better stats directly after each battle. During battles, Serge and his party members can perform three kinds of attacks: weak, medium, and strong. Strong attacks tend to miss more frequently. Magical spells are equipped by each character like items, and can be cast only as many times as they are equipped. Actions in battle deplete a certain amount of stamina, which recovers as other characters act. 

Chrono Cross features many recruitable characters (up to 40, but not all of them can be recruited in one play-through), several different endings, and the ability to play the game again with the same stats and items from the previous play.</desc>

		<desc>Circuit Breakers is a racing game similar to Micro Machines and Ignition, where the vehicles resemble toys viewed from above. The game lets the player control cars (of various models), boats and submarines that change according to the track.

The tracks have power-ups. They can be collected and activated and have negative and positive effects. Most are standard power-ups from this type of game, like speed boosts and oil leaks. Some are more bizarre, making the vehicle bigger or smaller, or making it bounce or fly.

The tracks are organized by theme and difficulty. By winning races the player receives access to increasingly more challenging tracks. The game controls are particularly sensitive, and getting out of the path often makes the vehicle explode.

Instead of a fixed camera, the game usually changes angles when the vehicle reaches certain points of the track. The camera can go as low as behind the vehicle, and go high to a "bird's eye" viewpoint.

Multi-player mode has its own set of tracks. It supports up to 4 players (using a multi-tap).</desc>

The evil "Siamese twins" that run the orphanage have Miette steal stuff for them. But all of a sudden, some dark presence starts to steal the souls and dreams of the little children. Of course, it is up to Miette to save the day and get to the bottom of these events.
 Like the Alone in the Dark series, The City of Lost Children takes place in a 3D, 3rd person adventure world filled with lots of diverse and challenging puzzles, objects and people to interact with and a strict likeness (visually) to the movie.</desc>

		<desc>Re-write history with Civilization II as you lead your people to the promised land of peace and harmony with neighbouring cultures. That's one theory anyway, though what usually happens is that the Chinese whisper of international diplomacy means that the message gets distorted in transmission.
 You start Civilization II as leader of a puny tribe of people, eking out a subsistence-level existence in a time where log fires are considered hi-tech. Using your leadership and strategy skills, you must explore your world, expand your empire and ensure the survival of your way of life in what can turn out to be a pretty dog-eat-dog world.
 As time passes and your success builds you will form new alliances, make new enemies, discover new technologies and systems of government . . .all with the aim of ensuring the persistence of your civilisation. Noble aims which will sometimes mean brinkmanship, double-dealing and back-stabbing, but it's for the greater good, and all that. With a new interface developed specially for PlayStation and a huge depth of gameplay, Civilization II lets you steer history from the Stone Age to the future, and wage war with anything from spears to stealth bombers.
 With FMV sequences bringing your most notable achievements to life, will you have greatness thrust upon you?</desc>

Renamed Cleopatra's Fortune, this block dropping Tetris-styled puzzle game now reaches the U.S. on the PlayStation with gameplay nearly identical to its predecessors. Players can select from four modes of play: Arcade, Versus, Mystery and Time Attack.
			Utilizing an Egyptian-style motif, block types include Rock, Mummy, Gem, and Sarcophagus, each with specific characteristics and "line" requirements that affect removal from the stacks of blocks that accumulate as they fall and pile up. Blocks can be removed in several ways using combos, enclosures, lines, and pyramid stones. Each mode features a unique objective, ranging from solving 50 Sphinx riddles in Mystery mode to the frenetic ten-stage action of Time Attack.</desc>

		<desc>Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, released in Japan as Clock Tower Ghost Head, was released in 1998 for the PlayStation. While sharing the gameplay mechanics of the first two, the game could be considered a spin-off from the main series. The story follows 17-year-old Alyssa Hale who suffers from multiple personality disorder with an alter ego named Mr. Bates. It received overwhelmingly poor reviews, with critics citing the disjointed story and trial-and-error gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Codename: Tenka is an original first-person shooter developed for PlayStation and PC. In a futuristic setting, players take the well-armed role of the title character, who battles against the forces of a genetic engineering organization gone wrong. Enemies are varied, some deadly powerful, others agile, and difficult to hit.
 The game is completely 3D-rendered, and it is possible to aim up and down as well as left and right. Large, complex levels pose labyrinthine challenges, as well as the powerful bosses that wait secured in their deepest chambers. The game is set apart from contemporary first-person shooters by a crouch ability, which allows the lead character to crawl through ducts and other short spaces. The character can also run, strafe, and jump, for full-motion 3D shooter play.
 Features:
 * Upgrade your gun with mods found throughout each level
 * Navigate Tenka through a variety of environments to stop the genetic experiments
 * Use laser sighting to find your enemy and take him out in the light or in the dark</desc>

College Slam also includes fight songs performed by the University of Cincinnati Bearcat Band, cheerleaders and the ability to edit the names and stats of five players on your team.
			 As with other titles in the NBA Jam series, this is a two-on-two arcade-style basketball game emphasizing action. While the object is to outscore your opponents, there are numerous power-ups, hidden players and secret codes to alter gameplay. Be prepared for gravity-defying dunks that can shatter backboards and crazy moves like the whirlwind. In addition, scoring three baskets in a row will make your player "on fire," increasing his overall abilities for as long as the opposition is held scoreless.</desc>

		<desc>Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth.  To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death.

The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies.  After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.

Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space.  You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet.  Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations.</desc>

		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer developed ideas from Westwood's previous Dune 2, forming a real time strategy game which has influenced many. The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation.

The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry.

In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units.

The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert for the PlayStation is a conversion of the hit computer game of the same name. The game involves commanding either the Soviets or Allies through 14 different missions, which vary depending on the side you choose. In order to amass your troops (consisting of tanks, infantry, naval and air forces), you must first build various structures with your available funds. Each map screen will have two types of natural resources (ore and gemstones) that can be collected to finance your operation. Missions generally involve building a base, mining resources and generating a mix of troops to mount an assault on the enemy's base.
			The PlayStation version supports the mouse and includes a Skirmish mode, which lets you face up to three computer opponents on 20 different maps in an all-out battle for domination. Want to start out with more credits or troops? How about increase the game speed? These options can all be adjusted before you begin a game. The PlayStation version also supports the Link Cable so you can battle a second player head to head or with computer-controlled AI teams. Twenty-one music tracks will keep your foot tapping as you wage war, and a password save feature will allow you to continue your single-player missions at a later time.</desc>

Gameplay also included an in-game sidebar code called Soylent Green Mode. In this mode all ore fields turn to people/civilians, and ore trucks harvest them with grisly sound effects.

It also included 19 exclusive briefing FMV (full-motion video) clips that were not in any of the PC expansion packs, which had none. All of the videos are shown when the player either starts playing through the operational theatre from the beginning or when all the missions of the theatre are accomplished. In other cases, the briefing text is shown. The FMVs include a general for each side, telling the player the mission objectives; The Allied General Carville later appears in Red Alert 2 while Soviet General Topolov has made no further appearances in the Red Alert series.</desc>

The Main Event lets players choose between eight boxers, each differing in life (strength), power, speed and endurance. You'll then have to rise through the ranks and fend off challengers trying to make names for themselves. There are over 40 different boxers in total, including both male and female fighters with unique fighting styles. Building up your boxer's ratings is accomplished through winning bouts and sparring with your trainer Jackal, who may even teach you a few special moves!</desc>

		<desc>Contender is an arcade-style boxing game which features an Exhibition mode, a VS. mode, a Main Event mode, and a Tournament mode.

The exhibition mode lets the player pick a boxer and fight a computer boxer. The VS. mode lets two players slug it out in the boxing ring against each other. The tournament mode lets the player compete in a tournament.

The Main Event mode lets the player pick one of eight different boxers, each with their own set of skills (life, power, speed and endurance), and work their way through the ranks (Local, National and World) by defeating 40 different boxers in order to win the World Championship. If the player is good enough to actually win the World Championship, they then have to defend their belt against numerous challengers. Players can improve their skills by winning matches and training between matches by sparring with their trainer. Advancing through this mode also unlocks boxers for the exhibition mode. 

In the ring, each boxer can throw punches like jabs,
upper-cuts, hooks, and crosses,  and is also able to duck and weave and block high and low while on defense.</desc>

		<desc>The first title in the long-running PlayStation snowboarding series.

Imagine riding down the slopes, avoiding the trees and trying to hit the jumps. When you catch enough air, you grab your board, twist, and land a perfect trick. 

Choose from several different riders and 10 boards, and then hit one of the five courses. On each track you can earn three different trophies: one trophy is awarded for getting down the hill in the quickest time; catch big air to pull off big tricks to earn the highest trick point trophy; or win the final trophy by getting the highest total score, which is based on both time and trick points.

If the competition seems a little rough, race against the ghost from your last run and find a smoother line down the mountain.</desc>

		<desc>Keith J. Snyder is a policeman hired to provide security for a new horror-themed casino called the Desert Moon. Suddenly a fire breaks out and a mysterious black liquid starts to pour out of the water sprinklers, turning people into vampires. Now Keith must find his way out of the casino and also try saving as many people as he can while trying to figure out what caused the transforming black liquid from happening.

The game involves shooting the vampires with an anesthetic dart gun and then sprinkling them with white water to turn them back to the normal humans they once were. The player can also choose to kill them instead of saving them by shooting the vampires with lethal weapons. There are also other types of enemies, such as vampire bats, that must be killed also. The usual survival horror conventions appear here such as item boxes,droves of enemies, keys to locate, and puzzles which require searching for items to solve them.

There are minigames set in a casino, like roulette and slot machines. The money won in these games can be used to buy food and drinks, the in-game recovery items.</desc>

		<desc>Crash Bandicoot, a heroic, agile and mutated marsupial who must save his girlfriend Tawna. The main antagonist is Doctor Neo Cortex, a mad scientist who was often ridiculed by the scientific community for his outlandish (but nearly workable) theories and is now motivated to prove his tormentors wrong by creating a mutated army of beasts to conquer the world. Cortex's henchman is Doctor Nitrus Brio, the insecure creator of the Evolvo-Ray. Crash's love interest is Tawna, a female bandicoot about to undergo experimentation by the Doctors. Helping Crash in his journey is an ancient witch doctor spirit named Aku Aku, who has scattered masks of himself throughout the islands to grant Crash special powers. The boss characters of the game include Papu Papu, the obese and short-tempered chief of the native village; Ripper Roo, a demented kangaroo with razor-sharp toenails; Koala Kong, a muscular but unintelligent koala; and Pinstripe Potoroo, the tommy gun-wielding bodyguard of Doctor Cortex.</desc>

			 They will encounter many unfamiliar things, which can be entertaining but dangerous, too. The evil Grendels are the greatest threat to them, but if you guide them responsibly and show them what's good and what's bad in their world, your Norns will develop a better understanding of their environment.

		<desc>The game takes place upon the Shee Ark, where the player must save the Norns by opening up the doors to the different Terrariums (the same that are in Creatures 3). Around the world are small, blue stars that must be placed in a machine by the Norns in order to generate a key. However, the stars have a limited lifespan, with stars that rotate faster nearing the end of their lifespan. When exactly 25 Stars are placed in the machine, it will generate a key. In order to be able to carry stars, Norns must be trained from an early age.
Unlike previous Creatures games, each Norn must collect ten hearts in order to become fertile. These hearts are found throughout the shee ark, and can be collected by both Scrubby and the Norns. Ettins and Grendels are always infertile.
Around the world are a variety of medicinal plants, that closely, if not exactly, resemble Herbs from Creatures. These herbs have special effects on Norns, such as promoting sleep, getting rid of illness and decreasing Tiredness. Too many of these herbs can cause addiction. There are also several varieties of weeds found in the Jungle Terrarium that can be detrimental to a Norn's health.
Like the original Creatures Game, Norns in Creatures: Raised in Space are programmed to die from Illness at a Certain Age. The average lifespan of a Norn in this game is around four hours.

		<desc>Ever since the beginning of the 21st Century, crime has been getting worse and more severe. Criminals patrol the streets like everyday citizens looting valuables, murdering arch rivals, and speeding up and down city streets and highways. The question is: what is anyone going to do about these hoodlums?
 The answer lies within an elite force of police officers -- the Crime Killers. After purchasing the City Police Department, the URIEL Consortium gave the taskforce new uniforms, weapons, and three patrolling vehicles capable of considerable damage; the Turbo Patrol Car is a destructive land vehicle, the Bike is a speedy motorcycle, and the Wing reigns terror from the skies! Its time to take the streets back!</desc>

		<desc>Criticom is a one-on-one fighting game where 8 diverse fighters from across the galaxy vie for a crystal artifact. The game features a sci-fi backstory that involves mystery and intrigue surrounding the crystal and each of the 8 fighters is given a unique storyline to explain why he or she is so interested in the artifact. Among the colorful characters are a giant lizard man named Gorm, a ninja lady named Yenji, a killing robot named S.I.D., and a mysterious vampire-like creature named Demonica who places little value on clothing.

The fighting action takes place on a round, elevated platform. Each fighter begins the fight with a full power meter and one power meter refill in reserve that is activated when the primary meter is depleted. Thus, there are no rounds. The fight runs until one fighter is knocked out (no more power in their meter), one is knocked out of the arena (or steps/jumps out), or the time runs out.</desc>

		<desc>The loveable Croc is back in Croc 2, the sequel to the original PlayStation hit from Fox Interactive. After he and his Gobbo friends returned home, they thought the whole ordeal with Baron Dante was over with. Little do they know, the evil Dantinis are planning the evil villain's return.
 Meanwhile, Croc's life changed one day after discovering a bottled up message lying on the beach. The writers of the letter stated they were searching for their long-lost crocodile son. Thinking they could be his parents, Croc took the letter to King Rufus who suggested he journey to a faraway land, seek out the help of other Gobbos, and find his folks. The Gobbos then built a seesaw catapult to launch Croc to the foreign land, kick-starting his latest adventure.</desc>

		<desc>In Croc, you play Croc (ironically enough), a lively crocodile who was raised by the Gobbos. Jealous of their happiness, the evil Baron Dante took over the Gobbos Valley and enslaved all of them. Beany the Bird was able to help Croc escape and now he must free the Gobbos from their enslavement.
 Croc: Legend of the Gobbos has five stages that are broken into 40 levels. A total of nine bosses exist along with an entire host of evil creatures who must be overcome on your way to defeating Baron Dante. In the game you will be required to perform precision platform jumping during exploration through a 3D world. You can choose between three camera angles which but the camera rotates on its own as you move.
 There once was a village of super-cute animals known as the gobbos. One day, a basket washed onto the shore of the village, and inside it was a baby crocodile.</desc>

		<desc>In the value-priced Crossroad Crisis, it's up to you to protect a wandering baby chick stranded in a maze of red, green and blue tiles. By moving and rotating the tiles, you can create a safe path for the chick to walk on. But in order to complete each of the game's ten stages, you must first clear the required number of tiles from the board.
			Tiles are cleared by linking two or more of the same color and having the chick walk over them. Once the target number has been cleared, the exit appears and you can lead the chick to the next stage. The number of cleared tiles necessary to reveal the exit increases as the game progresses. Each time the chick walks off the edge of a tile, a life is lost and the board is reset.
			In addition to the ten stages of Clear mode, Vs. mode pits the chick against a duck in a two-player battle to clear tiles and lead your animal to safety first. Beginner mode contains three stages and a lesson on how to play.</desc>

The remaining one, a nameless captain, (whom the player plays as), joins the Resistance, where, as a significant symbol of the WEC's military power and political philosophy, he meets with resentment, distrust and outright hatred. However, he uncomplainingly undertakes dangerous missions, often with substandard equipment, and his continued success gradually earns the respect of his fellow Resistance members.</desc>

Venture between levels at any time as Drake increases his abilities in magic, strength, speed, skill, and other attributes.

 * Wield a battle axe, mace, longsword, war hammer, hatchet, and more
 * Master an assortment of powerful spells, from "firestorm" to "deadly swarm"</desc>

		<desc>Crypt Killer is a horror-themed lightgun shooter. As a tireless adventurer, you are looking for the "Eyes of Guidance", ancient crystals of mysterious power. To find them, you have to shoot your way through hordes of monsters.

The game has six stages which can be taken on in any order. Each stage consists of four acts. The levels range from dark forests to deep caves, ancient crypts and underwater labyrinths. You move through the 3D levels on a predetermined path and shoot at skeletons, zombies, spiders, demons and other foul beasts. Your standard weapon is a shotgun, but you can gain additional weapons like gatling guns and grenade throwers. Some enemies throw projectiles like knives or bones at you, so be sure to aim at those as well. If the screen becomes too crowded, clear it with a smartbomb. 
At the end of some acts, you can choose from one of two paths through the next act, giving you different ways of completing a stage. At the end of each stage, a boss enemy awaits.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2067, and the world, though prosperous and populated by huge cities, is in a state of decay. In this dark future, one-on-one Tank Duels (to the death) are the spectator sport of choice, and you are a contestant. You can choose between six different tanks, each of them varying in speed, shield strength, weapon power, and maneuverability.
			 Once you have chosen your tank, you must drive it around an obstacle-ridden, flat-surfaced arena, hiding behind barriers, and shooting your machine guns and heat-seeking missiles at an opposing tank. You can play against the computer or challenge a friend in head-to-head split-screen action. In the one-player mode, if you destroy the enemy tank, you win the round and advance to the next stage. If your tank loses all of its shield strength, the computer wins and the game is over. If you're playing with the timer on, the tank with the highest level of shield strength when the time runs out wins the battle.

		<desc>Cyberspeed is the World Television event of the future. Spread throughout the galaxy, there are ten tracks, each of which consists of a looped force beam, with other force beams branching off it. Each of the eight ships is connected to the track by a force beam, and each ship draws energy directly from the force beams. Energy to your ship can be drained by taking corners too fast, firing your weapons, getting hit by enemy fire, colliding with other ships, and by simply driving the ship. You can increase your energy by picking up power-ups that you'll find along the tracks. Each ship comes with a few extra engine power cells which can be used to break the sound barrier.
			Cyberspeed is broken up into three different kinds of races: Tournament Race, Free Race, and Time Trial. The tournament consists of ten different basic races against seven opponents, with additional bonus races that pit you against Super Ships. The Free Race is a single race against seven opponents, and you can only race on the first two tracks or on ones that you have already completed. The Time Trial is similar to the Free Race, but with only two pilots competing. In each of the three kinds of races, you can choose between eight different ships. Each ship is ranked according to thrust, mass, speed, and shield strength, and each ship is equipped with the same kinds of weapons: plasma bolts, missiles, and mines.</desc>

The perpetrator is the director of the hospital, Richter Harris. He has shut himself up in the hospital and taken a number of patients as hostages, leaving the police helpless and unable to move in. Richter's only daughter, Laura Harris, after hearing the situation, rushes to Los Angeles from San Francisco, and drives alone to the tragic scene at the hospital ground. Upon entering the hospital Laura finds herself transported to an old mansion, while the disembodied voice of her father pleads with her to leave. Nevertheless she must press forward to save her father and herself.

D is a puzzle game requiring Laura to solve esoteric inventory puzzles on a very strict time limit. Each of the game's four discs must be completed in about thirty minutes each, and saving is not an option. The time is kept track of using Laura's pocket watch. The pocket watch can also be used to supply hints for puzzles, but after three uses the glass will shatter and it will stop working. The game also has multiple endings.</desc>

Gameplay follows the basic design common to most music and rhythm games (also known as "Bemani" games), as onscreen cues direct the player to hit different buttons in time with the music. While it can be played with a regular PlayStation controller, the game also supports a special "dancing pad" that allows players to move their feet to the beat instead of just pressing buttons.

Plus, with the special Dance Pad (available with the Dance Dance Revolution Dance Pad set), you can get your friends and neighbors on the floor and down on their feet just like in the arcade. Turn that beat and show off how you like to move it!</desc>

		<desc>You were the greatest fighter pilot the world had ever known until a flash of light took you away from your plane. After awakening from a deep sleep, you realize you are no longer flying through the Earth's blue skies--you're not even human! Aliens have infected your blood with their DNA to get you to fight on their side. These aliens, referred to as Reptons, are locked in a bitter struggle against the Ovons to decide the fate of their galaxy. Since the Reptons desperately need your skills, they have been kind enough to genetically fuse your body with one of their ships.
 Darklight Conflict lets you fly over 50 single player missions to rid the galaxy of the dreaded Ovons. Missions range from dogfights, bombing runs, defending ships, as well as rescue and intelligence operations. Real-time lens flares and light sourcing will make the battles come alive, while 14 different weapons prepare you for whatever the enemy has in store. Throughout your adventure you'll have the opportunity to pilot different ships, some of which include bombers, gunships and fighters. Perhaps you'll be sent back home if you're successful...</desc>

Jedah, the "Lord of Vampire", has summoned all of the Night Warriors to his realm to be assimilated into his being.  Of course, this serves as a great excuse to have more one-on-one fights...

Play as Jedah, B. B. Hood, Q-Bee, Lilith, Demitri, Morrigan, Anakaris, Victor, L. Raptor, Hsien-Ko, J. Talbain, Felicia, Rikuo, Sasquatch, Bishamon, Donovan, Pyron or Huitzil, and conquer the enemy.</desc>

		<desc>Darkstalkers, known in Japan as Vampire, is a series of 2D fighting games developed and published by Capcom, beginning with Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors (Vampire: The Night Warriors) in 1994. The series is set in a pastiche Gothic horror universe and features a highly stylized, cartoonish graphic style. It features characters based on either various kinds of monsters (the titular "darkstalkers") or their hunters, who are all engaging in combat against each other. Darkstalkers introduced many of the concepts used in later Capcom fighting games, including its first use of 16-bit color animation sprites and gameplay mechanics later employed in the Street Fighter Alpha and Marvel vs. Capcom series.</desc>

		<desc>In Darkstone, you are the chosen one to counter Draak's plan to plunge the world into a new Age of Darkness. Character choices are made from four classes (wizard/sorceress, assassin/thief, warrior/amazon or monk/priestess). The overall objective is to track down the seven crystals of the Time Orb, created a millennium ago from the tears of the benevolent goddess Kaliba and restore it. Only then will you have the power of the mighty Orb at your disposal to use as the ultimate weapon against Draak.

By the numbers, Darkstone contains four distinct regions of Uma, more than 100 evil creatures based on 30 types of characters, 32 specific spells and nearly two dozen skills (six major). Additional features include full 360-degree movement, more than 30 weapons (some multi-purposed), numerous items and traps and over 200 enemies and characters with which to interact.</desc>

		<desc>Endorsed by the then England and Manchester United captain and international superstar, David Beckham Soccer is the last of Rage long tradition in developing soccer games.
It includes both national and club teams (from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), plus the ability to create custom teams,  with details ranging from the usual name, strips and colours to the stadium. Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as “Owin” or “Zanetee”), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team.
Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham's career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of  drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock “secrets”. 

Gameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator.
In terms of options, the game doesn’t offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)</desc>

Players are armed with a variety of weapons (chainsaws, grenades, machine guns, etc...) and a full range of unarmed combat moves (including the good old-fashioned crotch kick) all of which can be used to defend the goal but remember, the best defense is a good offense.

DBZ also has many of the features you would expect from a typical sports game including player development, league and season management, and stat tracking (scores, kills, etc...).</desc>

		<desc>Dead in the Water is a 3d Battle game that pits the players in heavily armed boats in fully destructable arena's. This is a a Vehicular Combat Game similar in basic structure to Twisted Metal or Vigilante 8. The player can select from 8 characters, each with their own unique boat and then is entered into an arena to race against 6 other contestants while also trying to score points by shooting and destroying the other boats.
 There aren't many modes in the game, just a little career mode that isn't that deep which has you go through a list of courses and you check them off the list after you are done. The other is single race where you and/or a friend go head to head or against AI opponents and just go through a normal race.</desc>

The game doesn't mess too much with a background story- it's a 3D one on one fighter that takes place within an arena of limited space.  Each character has their own unique way of fighting, their own abilities, and even their own hobbies and likes.  (For example, Ryu Hayabusa- yes, he of Ninja Gaiden fame- likes sushi, mountain climbing, and fishing.)</desc>

In the far future, conflict is at an all-time low and outdated defence bases are being vacated and replaced with automated software. You play as an cyberneer engineer sent to update one such base. Just after uploading the automating code, the base is suddenly invaded by unknown assailants from the air and ground. You must rely on your wits and the defence software to fend them off.

The main game takes place in a first-person view inside the complex. Trams connect the maze-like living areas to a handful of manned turrets outside. You must shuttle between shooting down waves of fighters in the turrets, and scouring the base levels for card keys during the down time.</desc>

But don't think your opponents will treat you with the giving of flowers either, because they will aiming to send you and your vehicle back to smash repairers not in one piece, but for the sale of spare parts.
 From the main menu, players can select from Single Race, Demolition League and Two Player modes. Single Race is further broken down into Demolition (the importance is both based on getting over the finishing line and scoring demolition points), The Chase (crossing the finishing line is the only goal), Chicken (drive aggressively, but try to stay alive to cross the finish line, and oh yeah there are cars driving in the opposite direction too you), Last Man Standing (a bowl competition, last man not smashed up wins) and Suicide (opposite to Last Man Standing, it's a battle to destroy yourself first) all with the unifying idea of being based on a single race.
 Demolition League is a competition mode spread over various tracks with the very broadly split Arena and Circuit competitions. Circuit difficulties include Rookie League (5th or better to pass), Semi-Pro League (six demolition styled courses, but you have to place at least third in every race), Pro League (eight courses, but you must place first in all) and Endurance League. Two Player mode on the other hand not only allows players to play in the standard Single Race competitions (such as Chicken, Last Man Standing, Chase and Suicide), but also the Two Player only Team Demolition (a co-operative demolition mode) and Head 2 Head Demolition.</desc>

		<desc>The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed "Material Defender", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way.

Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction).

The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.</desc>

		<desc>.... Over a 1000 years ago when the Strega suddenly appeared in Zamu'el, a small country located on the edge of the continent. These Strega possessed mysterious powers, and so they were revered and respected by the men and women of Zamu'el.
 Aside from their mysterious powers, the Strega also possessed knowledge far more advanced than that of Zamu'el, in such fields as metallurgy and agriculture. The Strega gladly passed this knowledge on to the inhabitants of Zamu'el, transforming the once poor country into a prosperous nation. Furthermore, the Strega, in their kindness, created objects that would allow normal humans to control powers similar to their own and bestowed them upon the people.
 Many of these objects, called Jeno at the time, were made and presented to the populace of Zamu'el. As the people learned to use the Jeno, they began to extend their borders into neighboring lands. With their new powers, they felt invincible, and failed to listen to the warning of the Strega whom they had once revered as gods. In just a short 10 years, Zamu'el had conquered the entire continent.
 However, even as they destroyed the last of their enemies, their mighty Empire began to crumble. Greedy, ambitious men rebelled throughout the land - each rebellion fought by Jeno bearers. The Jeno War, as it was eventually called, unleashed unimaginable destruction upon the land and its people. The very continent they had fought to win, was nothing more than a wasteland of disease and death by the time the fighting ended. In addition, the devastating power of the Jeno vanished, making the objects nothing more than fancy trinkets.</desc>

		<desc>You probably feel like a crash test dummy when you're playing this game - it's not only a racing game, but you get points for wrecking your enemies! The amount of points you get depends on how you hit them ... e.g. you get more points for getting them do a 360 other than driving into theirs sides at high speed. The game has more to offer: a head to head mode with only two cars or the legendary destruction derby itself - a huge arena, every car starts at the edge of it, and then - have a nice crash!</desc>

		<desc>Strap in, hold on, hit the gas, and you're off on a quest for destructive points in Destruction Derby 2, the smashing sequel to the original demolition derby game from Reflections Interactive and Psygnosis. This edition offers seven larger tracks with lots of jumps and flips, as well as the dreaded crisscross sections where huge damage often ensues. Choose one of three cars and take your pent-up rage into one of four bowl arenas or one of four circuit courses. Let the mayhem begin!
 The new Pit Stop feature allows the player to make repairs to a damaged vehicle and head back out into the fray. Realistic physics deforms cars (and their nice paint job) as you collide with 19 other racers. The game's physics engine allows wheels, car hoods and other debris fly to everywhere. Localized damage adds an element of strategy too, as headfirst ramming destroys engines and can quickly take the driver out of the game. Players will have to develop some strong techniques or they'll be stalled on the sidelines by the middle of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing," "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely discouraged either.
 Battle enables four players to compete in split-screen competition across varying "disciplines." The Assault sub-mode is simply a last-man-standing event in which competitors battle head-to-head. Here, options such as the track and lap count can be adjusted as desired. The Destruction Derby event, a series staple, now offers Classic and Arena variations. In Skyscraper, players aim to push one another off the roof of a tall building. Last of all is Pass Da Bomb, where the object is, of course, to not have possession of the bomb.
 Smash 4 $ mode is fairly self-explanatory. To earn money (functionally equivalent to points), players are expected to liberally dole out damage to any of the other racers. High-speed collisions satisfy the basic requirement for "stunts." By pulling off a Corkscrew, Teeth Puller, or Bone Cruncher, players earn these much-needed points, and also cause real-time damage to the unlucky recipient's car. Point totals and finishing place all count towards a final point tally, which is in turn measured against a predetermined value. Players must earn enough to continue on to the next event. Accumulated cash can then be spent to upgrade or repair your vehicle.</desc>

Die Hard 1 is a third person shooter in a style similar to Tomb Raider.  You are John McClane and must fight through twenty floors of terrorists in the Nakatomi Plaza.  The game has an invisible wall effect which allows you to see John even in small hallways.

Die Hard 2 is a first person rail shooter in the vein of Virtua Cop or Mad Dog McCree.  Once again you take the role of John  McClane firing upon terrorists who happen to be ransacking the Washington/Dulles Airport in search of a South American dictator and druglord.

Die Hard 3 is a fast-paced taxi racer through the city.  John must this time speed through New York City defusing bombs and ramming evildoers off the road behind the wheel of a cab.</desc>

In Die Hard Trilogy 2: Viva Las Vegas for the PlayStation, you'll reprise the role of John McClane as you lay waste to the threats and save innocent people along the way -- this time in the Sin City capital of the world: Las Vegas, Nevada. The game comes packaged as a three-in-one deal, just like the original Die Hard Trilogy, for a total of 25 non-stop action-packed levels.
 The first game, Movie Mode, plays in the third-person with a story behind it. McClane attends a party by a friend in the city of lights, but unfortunately a riot breaks out of the Mesa Grande Prison and he's caught between a rock and a hard place. No more holidays for our restless hero as he takes on guards, grunts, prisoners, thugs, bio-specialists, enforcers and even spec ops! Complete with CG cut-scenes, voices galore and two new camera angles, you must make your way through various obstacles alone while killing terrorists and rescuing hostages. But no evildoer gets by that easily when McClane is in town!</desc>

Three Digimon card levels, rookie (R), champion (C) and ultimate (U) (mega Digimon), can be "digivolved" to create more powerful creatures. Partner Cards, selected at the beginning of each game, can get armor, gain experience points, and power up with the use of Digi-Parts as you advance through battles.</desc>

		<desc>Digimon Rumble Arena is a family-friendly fighting game offering single- and two-player modes. You can battle as or against your favorite digital monsters, both past and present. Power-ups give Digimon characters defining special abilities that can make a difference in close contests and platform traps like conveyor belts and falling icicles are part of the mix.
 In single-player mode, you compete against the computer by clearing stages and advancing through all 20 characters. Six environments include Sanctuary (lightening bolts), Wilderness (boulders), Garbage Recycling Center (compactor), Revolution (rotating screen), Glacier (icicles), and Volcano, with a few mini-games thrown in for fun. Two-player action lets you compete against another human, while the Versus Computer mode offers single matches against the computer where you pick the level and character to fight.
 Each Digimon has special moves, such as Wormon's sticky net, Stingmon's moon shooter, and MegaGargomon's bum rush, and gaining enough energy allows them to "digivolve" into more powerful versions for a limited amount of time. Special items featuring positive and negative effects appear sporadically during the fighting and affect gameplay: digi plus, digi minus, max and forced digivolve, power down, queen device, evil ring and spiral bomb, and fire, water, and wind attacks.
 Features:
 Campaign, two-player, and single-match fighting modes
 Twenty characters from all three seasons of Digimon: Digital Monsters
 Six arenas, power ups, and special moves

		<desc>An RPG based upon Bandai's Digimon cartoon series, Digimon World 3 follows the adventures of Junior and his two friends, Teddy and Ivy, as they take part in a game of Digimon Online. Upon starting, the player will have to pick a trio of Digimon from the three initial sets available. Once in the world of Digimon Online however, the three friends are informed that the system is in dire need of repairs and that they'll have to stay until the repairs are complete.
 Viewed from a top-down isometric perspective, players must guide their virtual avatars through the online world, battling other "tamers" and exploring the many game areas while learning more about the hackers that have invaded the game. Situated in the many towns that dot the virtual landscape, shops and inns will provide the group with much needed supplies and rest, provided they have enough Bits (the world's currency) to afford it all, that is.
 The 3D Battles are turn-based, and provide a selection of battle options from which to choose, including the ability to unleash standard attacks, use items or special techniques, switch Digimon, or run from battle. In keeping with the cartoon on which it is based, Digimon are also able to Digivolve into more powerful creatures during battle.
 As your Digimon take damage, a blast meter gradually fills. When full, it allows the creature to Blast Digivolve, imbuing it with an increase in attack level. Tamers also have the ability to merge two creatures using the DNA Digivolve ability, which will yield an all-new Digimon who performs a random attack before disappearing. Through continued battling, Digimon will gain experience and rise in level and ability, and will eventually evolve into a new, permanent form.
 Along with the Digimon found in the first three seasons of the cartoon show, Digimon World 3 features 20 original Digimon created specifically for the game. An additional side-quest allows players to seek out Digimon cards in order to build a formidable deck with which to battle others. There are a total of 314 cards to be collected in the game.
 Features:
 Based upon the Digimon: Digital Monsters cartoon show
 Engage in battles that will see your Digimon Digivolve, Blast Digivolve, and DNA Digivolve their way to victory
 Featuring Digimon from the first three seasons of the show as well as 20 all-new Digimon</desc>

		<desc>An abandoned research complex on a remote jungle island, a team of special forces operatives, a horde of vicious velociraptors, and one big, mean Tyrannosaurus rex constitute the setting and cast of Dino Crisis, the latest masterpiece from the makers of Resident Evil.
 Dr. Edward Kirk is supposed to be dead. Three years ago while working to establish a new type of energy technology code-named Third Energy, an experiment went awry and terminated the brilliant scientist's life -- or so it was thought. It was recently learned, however, that Dr. Kirk is very much alive and continuing his work at a Borginia Republic research facility on Ibis Island.
 In order to investigate the situation, an elite special forces team including agents Regina, Gail and Rick was sent. The three expected another routine mission, but what they got was an all-out fight for their lives against an enemy they surely had never been trained to face -- dinosaurs!
 Luckily, Regina isn't restricted to limited firepower, as she'll come across shotguns, dart guns, and other weapons throughout the island. To gain access to the keys, code disks, and ID cards necessary for continued exploration, Regina must solve a variety of puzzles.
 Dino Crisis has three possible endings with a great deal of secrets becoming available after each has been viewed. These include new weapons, new costumes, and a "Wipe Out" mode in which you must defeat a certain number of dinosaurs within a designated time period.</desc>

Regina is sent on a rescue mission with her new ally Dylan Morton, who has a strange connection to the events on the island. The player's control switches between Regina and Dylan at specific points in the game.

 Death, the grim reaper, who normally ushers the Discworld inhabitants into the afterlife, is on an extended vacation. This means that those whose "time is up" are faltering around in limbo. Now it's up to Rincewind to bring him back or suffer the fate of immortality.
 Gameplay is divided into 4 Acts. There are many locations to explore and a multitude of obstacles in Rincewind's path to overcome. Conversations with characters and interaction with inventory objects is necessary to move ahead.
 The game features unique humour similar to the previous game.</desc>

		<desc>There's simply not enough honey for Pooh to have a proper party, and Tigger's the only animal in the 100 Acre Wood who can help! Control Tigger as he bounces from place to place, collecting as much honey as he can get his paws on. Of course, it's not all as easy as it sounds; slippery ice, dangerous bees, scary bats, and other environmental concerns will follow Tigger throughout his adventure, and there also dark caves and falling boulders to contend with! Intended for children ages four and up, Tigger's Honey Hunt has nine action-packed levels to master, and each features bold, colorful graphics that will have little ones giddy with excitement. Three mini-games allow players to earn the Accordion Leap and Tigger-tastic Bounce two maneuvers that will help procure Pooh's "most-favorite" snack. Packed with beloved characters from A.A. Milne's classic tales, this is one game that anyone can enjoy.</desc>

It seems that as an egg, Aladar was stolen and then accidentally dropped onto an island populated by lemurs. The colony took in the little dinosaur and raised him as their own. Players will get to take Aladar and his friends, Zini and Flia, on a journey across 12 different stages.
 Each of the friends possesses different abilities so players will have to exercise strategy and teamwork to navigate through each level. Want to smash a rock? You'll need Aladar's tail. If you need something airlifted, however, Flia is the only pteranodon in town. Players will have to avoid enemies and traps in this overhead 3D game while they gather items and accomplish level goals. Aladar wants to get back with his own species, but there are carnivores and other more pernicious things lying in wait.</desc>

		<desc>Geared toward young children, Disney's Pooh's Party Game: In Search of the Treasure is a board game adventure similar to Mario Party. As Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, Piglet, Owl, or Roo, players must make their way around three increasingly difficult board games in an attempt to finish first. One to four players can participate in the adventure, or simply compete against each other in the mini-games.
 Adventure mode has players moving around the different squares of the board and challenging the other characters in one of five mini-games. The outcome of the mini-game determines the number of squares each player can move on the next turn. First place earns six squares, second place earns four squares, third place earns two, and last place earns one.
 Collectible honey pots along the way boost a character's moving potential, and there can be positive or negative effects when landing on a particular square. For instance, players may have to move back a certain number of spaces, lose honey pots, or receive an extra move. Players will also encounter Gopher, as well as bees, Heffalumps, and Woozles in their journey around the board.
 Five mini-games include Owl's Fruit 'n' Hoot, Pooh's Pinball Party, Tigger's Thunder &amp; Frightening, Rabbit's Roller Races, and Piglet's Pumpkin Hunt. While only two mini-games are available for quick play in the beginning, the others become unlocked after playing the adventure mode. Difficulty levels for the mini-games can be adjusted to Easy, Normal, or Hard.</desc>

While many of the levels offer platform-jumping, vine-swinging fun, some of them recreate some of the action sequences from the movie. No matter where he is, Tarzan must collect the tokens and fruit that are scattered about. Collecting 100 tokens earns an extra life, and the fruit can be used to dispose of enemies. If you can collect the four pieces of Jane's baboon drawing, you can earn the chance to play a bonus level. You've got to help the young ape-man discover his place in the world with TARZAN.</desc>

A point-and-click adventure game, this sequel tells the tale of Jonathan Harker, a man trying to rescue his wife, Mina, from the clutches of the infamous blood-sucker.

Movement and interaction are facilitated by a context-sensitive cursor, through which players can manipulate puzzles and the environment. The puzzles themselves are a familiar blend of search quests and brain-teasers, requiring players to acquire and combine numerous items before they can be used to remove particular obstacles.</desc>

Using any PlayStation Memory Card, the game will generate a monster of your choice from data saved on that given card. The result is a dragon or monster that will need training and nurturing as your overall mission is to mold a fierce combat-ready critter!
 There are a few different locations in The Dragonseed City including a clone lab, nursery, Bio Bank (a storage facility for multiple dragons), the public shop, a junk shop, Pablo's, the Memory Forest, training center, Battle Arena, and your apartment (a home away from home). New players or those looking for a new critter will need to pay the clone lab a visit; it is here where your dragon is created. Lab director Tomas will give you all the necessary information on life creation including DNA structures, segments, and keyword structures.</desc>

In order to find that out, you travel to the past, where you hope to solve the mystery and to restore the present world the way it was before.

"Dragon Warrior VII" shares with its  predecessor the job system: you can assign character classes ("jobs") to your party members, and learn many different abilities, depending on the job you have chosen. The game maintains the traditional style of the series, including strictly medieval setting and first-person turn-based combat.</desc>

		<desc>Dragonheart: Fire and Steel was released to the public in 1996, and is a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up based off of the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of a retired knight who must return to action and remain true to the oaths he took long ago. An evil prince's tyranny threatens the land, and the knight (who was a former dragonslayer) can only defeat this scheming noble with the help of a friend who just happens to be the last surviving dragon on Earth.

Players must punch, kick, and slash their way through multiple levels in their quest, facing off against both weak and powerful enemies bent on stopping them. At the end of each level boss characters stand ready to slay the player, who must defeat them to continue, for retreat is not an option. Rendered and digitized graphics are used in the game to represent the backgrounds and characters respectively, though the title runs in a low graphic resolution.</desc>

The game has 28 levels in total, varying from L.A. in the present time, to the Ancient west, and the Colloseum. The game has a 2-player mode so that 2 people can wreak havoc at each other. The game has many kinds of enemies; Pig Cops, Lizards, Octabrains, etc.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens have wiped out Earth's men and are now looking to enslave the planet's women for their own hybridization program. Who's going to save the babes of Earth? Duke Nukem, that's who. Working with the Unified Babe Resistance, Duke must counteract the aliens through 14 levels of first-person search and destroy. He'll face mutant primates, Hoglodytes, Pig cops, and Octabrains with an awesome arsenal at his disposal, including such weapons as blasters, flamers, grenade launchers, and Duke's new weapon of choice, the .50 caliber Desert Eagle pistol.
 Duke Nukem: Planet of Babes features four challenging training areas and six multiplayer levels, each with its own secret areas; high-tech items including infrared goggles, jetpack, and teleporter; and an ego meter that shows how well Duke's able to go on with the crusade. The game's story is propelled by 25 interstitial sequences including an unlockable bloopers sequence. Parents should note: with middle school locker-room humor and no small amount of action-game violence, this game is not intended for kiddies.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens have landed in futuristic Los Angeles and it's up to the Duke to bring the pain and show them the door. After the initial entries of side-scrolling platform games, Duke Nukem 3D introduces a first-person perspective to the series and turns the game into a full-fledged shooter with 2.5D graphics.

Duke's arsenal includes pistols, pipe bombs, laser trip mines, Nordenfelt guns, a chain gun and various rocket launchers, but also his mighty foot to kick enemies. The game sports a high level of interactivity. Many objects in the environment can be broken or interacted with, such as pool tables, arcade machines, glass, light switches and security cameras. The protagonist is also able to hand strippers a dollars to have them remove their top.</desc>

		<desc>Thanks to reruns on cable TV's The Nashville Network, The Dukes of Hazzard has reached a new audience. Featured as a prime time network series more than a decade prior to the release of this Arcade-style racing game, The Dukes of Hazzard spawned a ColecoVision cartridge in 1984. Now, with The Dukes of Hazzard: Racing for Home, PlayStation owners can get behind the wheel of the General Lee and try to foil the mischievous and downright criminal dealings of Boss Hogg, the fat blowhard in the white suit, and Rosco P. Coltrane, the inept hick sheriff.

The single-player game consists of nine episodes. Each episode is divided into three scenes. Here are just a few of the mission objectives you must complete: find and rescue Uncle Jesse and stop his truck; take part in the Hazzard Overland Race to try and win mortgage money; find Boss Hogg's car and pull it over; and rescue Daisy Duke (the Southern babe in the cutoff shorts) from kidnappers. While racing through each mission, you must avoid cop cars, speed traps, road obstacles and other hazards.</desc>

		<desc>Well, sir, things in Hazzard County just aren't goin' as smoothly as they should be. Sure, the Duke cousins, Luke and Bo that is, are just back from Capital City after winnin' another race, but some new folks have come into town; folks that aren't interested in the scenic back roads that Hazzard has to offer. No, they're more interested in pinnin' a dirty crime on Hazzard's own Daisy Duke, the sweetest flower in the south. It'll be up to Luke, Bo, and Daisy to avoid Enos, Rosco, and that troublemakin' Boss Hog while solving this crime and put those no good crooks behind bars. Thankfully, they have all the tools they'll need: Daisy's trusty jeep and, of course, the famous General Lee.
 In Dukes of Hazzard II: Daisy Dukes it Out, it will take a player's racing prowess and lead foot to make it through the pitfalls and troubles of this dusty country county. Players will control either the Duke boys in their high-powered General Lee or Daisy in her jeep as they sweep through the dirt roads and downtown of Hazzard. Levels alternate between the two vehicles, and the objectives you must complete are varied as well. You might find yourself outrunning the law or perhaps showing someone the sights in Hazzard. You might even deliver some mail, but eventually you'll get down to some good, old-fashioned crime fighting.
 The physics of the game are decidedly arcade in their handling, focusing more on speed and hi-jinks rather than precision. The levels that you drive through offer ramps and a variety of short cuts through corn-fields and back roads. Players can also pick up several different items, like wrenches to fix their damaged vehicles or nitro gas to give them a short boost of speed. If the single-player missions become a drag, then there's a two-player mode that allows you to select several multiplayer game variants, such as tag.
 Features:
 Featuring the voice talent of John Schneider, Catherine Bach, Ben Jones, and Sonny Shroyer
 Pick up power-ups, destroy objects in the environment, and explore several large environments
 Take the wheel of Daisy's Jeep or the General Lee and drag race, smash fences, and jump rivers</desc>

		<desc>Dune 2000 is a remake of the classic Dune II updated for Windows. In this Real-Time Strategy game, you can play one of the three houses, the evil Harkonnen, the greed filled Ordos or the noble Atreides. Each has different sets of units and tactics while maintaining an overall balance.

Unlike the original, the cutscenes happen after every mission, with live-cast this time, already seen in Westwood Studio's Command &amp; Conquer franchise. A 16-bit color mode was the next step for their RTS genre, boosting up the graphics in Dune 2000.

Everything from the original is back - sandworms, the spice, the Fremen, the known structures and the map of the planet, even the intro cinematic is a 3D enhanced version of the original one.

Each house fights differently. The noble Atreides have air-superiority and rely on their honour and alliance with planet natives, the Fremen. The insidious Ordos rely on guerrilla tactics and superior technology, as well as mercenaries. The evil Harkonnen just go brutal, with no care for lives of their own troops or destruction as longs as they are victorious.

Unlike the Windows version, the PlayStation version of the game is fully 3D.</desc>

		<desc>Dynasty Warriors is a 3D-based fighting game developed by an in-house development studio within Koei. Koei is better known for its third century China war simulations. This is their first crack at the whip with a PlayStation fighting game.
 The game is weapons based, meaning there is no hand-to-hand combat that does not incorporate weapons. The storyline is in line with the Koei war sims, so this is a fighting game based on real history. The characters are pulled straight from the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Each character is either based on or tied to one of the legendary warlords who fought to unite under their own kingdom.</desc>

		<desc>E.T. may have left Earth safely onboard his spaceship, but trouble awaits him soon after landing in this 3D PlayStation adventure. The universe is in danger and only E.T. can help save it, by finding exotic plants. As the kind-hearted alien from the 1982 film, re-released in 2002 to commemorate its 20th anniversary, players must rescue rare plants from a total of five planets: Green Planet, Ice Planet, Desert Planet, Planet Metropolis, and Earth. Each planet contains a specific number of plants to find across three levels.

Worlds are also filled with hostile creatures or government agents, so E.T. needs to use his special powers to help him overcome all manner of threats. As E.T. walks and runs across the levels, he can call upon the power of telekinesis to move items closer, use his healing power to restore flowers, and unleash a heart stun to temporarily freeze enemies. Also available on each level are items such as keys or switches, which let E.T. access blocked areas. Progress in the adventure can be saved to a memory card.</desc>

Armstrong has been dispatched to the region to neutralize the insurgents. As commander of Eagle One, you must lead the mission to reclaim the "Jewels of the Pacific" and annihilate the terrorist threat.
 Get ready to strap yourself into six of the world's most powerful and sophisticated attack aircraft, including the Harrier Jump Jet, F-15 Eagle, A-10 Warthog bomber and the elusive "Raven" stealth fighter (after you steal it from the bad guys). You will embark on 25 objective-based single-player missions (divided among five islands) utilizing a variety of weapons in air-to-air, air-to-ground and air-to-sea battles. The story is told through CNN-style full motion video (FMV) clips and is advanced with additional news footage that sets the stage for the missions that follow.</desc>

He answered the phone and was greeted with some bad news -- his father's home had caught on fire and the old man was missing. Accompanied by a policeman, Richard returned to the house to investigate and find any clues he could of his father's disappearance or the fire.
 As he was sifting through the ashes and debris, he came across an old key for the grandfather clock. He inserted the key into the clock and opened up a secret passage. Startled, he entered the passage only to find a large red book telling of the Rockwell dynasty. The family, as well as 45 other people, had vanished one year ago aboard the luxury boat Orpheus.</desc>

		<desc>Charlie has really done it this time. While reaching for his beloved donuts, he accidently spilled coffee on his work station at the MomSteel Steel Factory. Now the machinery has taken on a life of its own! Assume control of Charlie the Egg in your effort to find the reset switch located somewhere within the factory. The game consists of 43 pre-rendered levels and 12 boss characters, all of which are various forms of machinery, from Blast Furnace Bill to Rotato the Repair Robot.

In order to clear a level, Charlie must locate a certain number of time clocks and hit them with his wrench. To reach the clocks, he'll need to walk across narrow ledges, spinning gears, and past open flames. Besides using the wrench, Charlie can also jump, throw bolts and roll away. Items to look out for are paper airplanes (they'll give you information or clues), donuts to replenish any damage, coins to give you extra lives and fans to cool you down. After all, moving through a hot steel factory can be especially dangerous to an egg. The game automatically saves your progress to memory card, so keep moving and save that factory!

The most notable feature of the game is the number of impressive CG cinemas that play constantly throughout your adventure. If you fall off an edge, you'll see Charlie do a Humpty Dumpty impression, and if you make it to the next level by punching the last time clock, a transition scene will play.</desc>

Since it was obviously something of value, it was decided that it would be awarded to the best fighter in the world. After all, who would appreciate a weapon more than an experienced fighter? Eleven of the world's finest combatants (including Cloud Strife, Tifa Lockhart and Vincent Valentine) have set out to claim this prize.
 The mysterious artifact came to be known as Ehrgeiz, and the tournament that was built around it took on the very same name. Now rumors suggest that the door to a long-forgotten land can be unlocked with this weapon; a land that could reveal the secret of immortality. The tournament has taken on a whole new meaning!</desc>

		<desc>In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einhänders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.

On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einhänders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.

The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.</desc>

By means of a Neural Network Computer fueled by the grey matter of unfortunate 'volunteers', he plans to conquer the known world, replacing it with a new order of his design. 

The only fly in the ointment is disturbing reports of two powerful Elementals storming across the land on a direct course toward the palace.

One or two players can assume the identities of these Elementals as they crusade for an unknown master toward a climactic battle. 

The story unfolds by means of fully-3D action levels interspersed with hand-drawn animation scenes.</desc>

		<desc>The Elimination event was the ultimate in televised arena combat. The participants were prisoners, of course, since no one sane enough would take up the gauntlet without some sort of incentive. Since those who survived the Elimination were granted reprieve and released back into society with both fame and wealth, the incentive was clear!
 All this came to an end during the Civil War. Instead of being televised, the Elimination served as a testing ground for weapons to be used in future battles. And the participants? They were prisoners of war, forced to compete solely for the amusement of the government. Now you happen to be next in line for the Elimination, and you're going to have to use all of your survival instincts to make it through alive.
 Eliminator lets you select one of four different crafts, each rated in shield power, weapons and top speed: the Redeemer, Freedom, Liberty and Survivor. The Elimination event is comprised of eight arenas filled with robotic creatures and futuristic defenses. You'll begin play in the Penitentiary, and then navigate through the Maze, Asylum, Cage, Chasm, Monastary, Tomb and Fortress.
 While the goal of surviving each arena may sound straightforward enough, there are a few things any budding pilot should be aware of before strapping in. First, your ship has a bomb attached to it! If you don't complete the arena within the time limit, the bomb will detonate. Another thing to worry about is the boss character after each level, so make sure you collect as many of the twelve assorted weapons as you can within the arenas.
 Progress will be saved after each level for those with a memory card, and two players can duke it out in three special duel zones: the Pit, the Dome and the Labyrinth. The object in the multi-player game is to simply destroy your opponent's base while protecting your own. Yet in order to destroy a base, you must first find the three Warp Bombs hidden somewhere within the arena!

Having spread across the globe, it has forced the remnants of human civilization into hiding underground. Home to humanity is Neural City, which is controlled by the Byflos Group, who hold the threat of shutting off all life support over the heads of the city's denizens. As Masao Coda, a member of the Del Sol liberation group, you must use your Protect Armor suit to engage the Byflos Group and its many robotic minions, rescue your infected girlfriend from certain death at the hands of the virus, and eventually, save humanity.

A fourth event, the Sydney Horse Trials at the Sydney International Equestrian Center, can be unlocked by earning points during a full championship season at the other three venues. Events consist of three main challenges, Dressage, Cross Country, and Show Jumping, with specific scoring rules and penalties in each.

The Single Player option includes five modes of gameplay: Championship, Three Day Event, Single Event, Practice, and Training. Four levels of difficulty (beginner, amateur, veteran, and expert) require 15, 30, 50, and 75 points (respectively) for qualification in the Sydney event, and players can customize rider set-ups in any mode by selecting horse, country, rider, and slot (four per country). All modes except Training and Practice accommodate multiplayer action for up to four separate competitors or in team events.</desc>

Exhibition mode helps the player get to know the courses and equipment as well as get a feel for the controls. New season offers the player the chance to race against sixteen other competitors on any of the four racing machines competing for season points as well as money to upgrade equipment.
 Choose between roller blades, a luge (basically a sit-down skateboard), a mountain bike, and the skateboard. The player can also determine which character they want to race with, each one having a unique skill on one of the apparatus. For example one might be top-notch at roller blading but be bad at bike-riding so there is no point choosing the bike with him/her. In a season, the player competes in the five locations - three times, twelve in all and each time the obstacles become more and more tricky to avoid as well as the other racers becoming faster and more agile.

		<desc>Luke and his sister Elena are two orphans, living in a small house in the kingdom of Gross. They have two good friends - Mouse and Nicol. One day, while exploring a local cave, the four youths find a mysterious jewel. Later, they travel to the city of Goondocks, where they find a similar jewel - along with a note left to them by Luke's and Elena's parents. They learn that their parents belonged to an ancient race named "Eternal Eyes" - people who could control inanimate dolls called Mappets. Now the four heroes have to learn the power of controlling Mappets, and to stop a villain from resurrecting the Goddess of Destruction.

"Eternal Eyes" is a combination of strategy console-style RPG similar to  Final Fantasy Tactics, and Pokémon-like monster-breeding gameplay. The only controllable human character in your party is Luke. Throughout the game, he will be able to capture more and more Mappets, which will then help him during his quest, also participating in battles. There are different kinds of Mappets which can be used with various effects during the turn-based battles.</desc>

Compared to Epic Pinball, it has a larger, 320x400 resolution, as well as taller tables, both allowing for more objects. It also has a typical Dot Matrix Display where the scoreboard shows 3D-rendered animations as well. The controls are more sensitive with a faster ball. This is less true to real pinball gameplay, but it speeds up the game's pace and gives more power to the player to influence the movement.</desc>

Available game modes are Single Race, Grand Prix, Championship, Private Trials and Time Attack. The tracks were modelled in 3D from GPS data sampled on the real roads. There are realistic physics, a telemetry system to analyse behaviour of your car and to tune its settings, complex driving AI, recordable replays, strategy management with animated pit sequences, weather simulation, and LAN support for multiplayer games.</desc>

		<desc>Conrad may have thought he escaped from the alien Morphs, but he thought wrong. After fighting his way through their world the first time, in a game called Flashback, he went into a cryogenic sleep aboard his little space vessel. For 50 years he drifted aimlessly in space, waiting to be found. The good news is that Conrad was found and beamed up on an alien ship; the bad news is that the alien race that found him is none other than his enemy: the Morphs. Once again, he must escape from their hostile world and regain his freedom that he had fought so hard for.
 Fade To Black is a sequel to the 2D classic Flashback. It picks up 50 years after the latter did, and uses the same character. Where this sequel differs is that it features 3D graphics in a 3D world, allowing players to immerse themselves even more in Conrad's struggle for freedom. The game features over 13 levels filled with intricate puzzles, sub-levels and missions, highly detailed textures and graphics, lots of items to interact with and a good amount of action.
 Features:
 # 13 levels
 # A variety of sublevels and challenging puzzles
 # Detailed 3D rendered characters
 # Simplified controls and gameplay</desc>

		<desc>Trump or trumps or trump suit are terms used in trick-taking games, traditionally called whist-style games although the best-known example may now be bridge, where cards of one suit rank above all non-trump cards, and automatically prevail over them, losing only to a higher trump if one is played to the same trick.
			In most games, trump cards cannot be played if the player has any cards of the suit led to the trick; in a few, trumps can be played at any time. Playing the first trump to an already-started trick is known as ruffing; if another player were to play a higher trump, that would be an overruff or more commonly an overtrump.
			Trump Shiyohyo! (or Card Shark in Europe) is a collection of card games that includes Poker, 21, Blackjack, etc. The gameplay is in first person perspective and the game features up to 4 human players to play at the same time using the multitap function.</desc>

		<desc>Whatever happened to family game night? Face it -- kids would rather plop down in front of the television or play a really good videogame than mess with silly board games or spend time with their family. While some would blame technology, 3DO has come up with a solution to the game night woes. As a compromise between videogames and classic board games, Family Game Pack features 25 classic family-oriented games!
 Family Game Pack is broken into four genres including card games, board games, casino games, and solitaire. With games such as Go Fish, Old Maid, and Hearts, there are plenty of card games for everyone in the family. Likewise, the included board games span a wide age group with Checkers for younger gamers and Backgammon for the adults. Is Dad constantly nagging you about him being an elite Chess champion? Show him up by challenging him to an intellectual battle between kings, queens, and their pawns!</desc>

		<desc>It starts as a simple assignment for the three mercenaries - the beautiful, mysterious Hana, the former army officer Glas, and the ruthless killer Deke. Somewhere in the futuristic Hong-Kong, full of huge corporations, flying cars and helicopters, home for the famous Triad mafia, they have to find the young Wee Ming Lam, the daughter of a powerful gangster. But Hana and her partners don't suspect that the search for Wee Ming will lead them not only to very dangerous areas of Hong-Kong, but to outskirt villages infected by zombies, a dubious restaurant-brothel, and the Chinese hell, where they'll have to confront Yim Lau Wong himself - the Chinese equivalent of the Western Satan...

The gameplay of "Fear Effect" is based on survival horror titles à la  Resident Evil, but it also features many pure action elements and arcade-like sequences, where precise timing matters. You can crouch, sneak on your enemies, and roll forward or to the sides. There are many human as well as monster enemies to eliminate or to avoid. The game's characters are created in animé style, although they appear in full 3D. The backgrounds are pre-rendered, but very intensely animated, similar to those of  Blade Runner. The story unfolds through numerous FMV cut scenes.</desc>

		<desc>In the near future, mankind's tinkering with the science of genetics and the developmental process of genome mapping has resulted in the accidental creation of a new disease known as EINDS. This disease, which attacks a cell's DNA and halts mitosis and meiosis (the processes that allow our cells to duplicate), has killed nearly a billion people and no hope of a cure has been discovered.
 With the disease spreading rapidly, it is feared that the manipulations of DNA will lead to mankind's complete undoing. It's up to three mercenaries and a mysterious woman with no past to combine their separate efforts into one adventure involving danger, intrigue, and supernatural involvement, with the prize perhaps being salvation for human kind.
 Fear Effect: Retro Helix is a cinematic adventure game for the PlayStation. Although it has been released after the original Fear Effect title, it is in actuality a prequel to the events in the first game, explaining how Hana Tsu-Vachel, Royce Glas, and Jacob Decourt wound up together. The game takes place over four levels, each of which has its own CD: futuristic, gritty Hong Kong, the Walled City of Xi'an, the Tomb of the First Emperor of China, and the legendary Penglai Shan, mountain home to the immortals.</desc>

		<desc>In Felony 11-79 the player is a thief hired by an eccentric millionaire that wants them to acquire an ancient statue that has been broken into three pieces and scattered throughout the city.  To obtain these pieces, the player must travel through these three areas (Downtown, Seaside, and Metro City) and complete certain objectives by obtaining certain items to complete missions or escaping police in high-speed chases all within a certain time limit.

Additionally, the player is also awarded monetarily for destroying other cars, objects such as lamp posts, fences, etc, however money is deducted for hitting pedestrians.  This money is used to customize the vehicles (20 total).  Players must also be aware of the destruction they do to their vehicle, if it is too damaged they will no longer be able to complete the mission and end the game.

There are also two other modes that are present, one of which is Time Trial where a player races against the clock and attempt to beat record time limits by any means including finding shortcuts.  There is also Test Run which lets a player get the feel of a car without the boundaries of set objectives or a time limit.</desc>

		<desc>This was the third FIFA title in a little over a year. It incorporates 42 national sides, as well as 250 club teams from 12 different leagues, to play a complete true-to-life season, the preset Super League, or a league or cup of your own design. Formations and tactics can be set, and players can be moved between teams. 

Gameplay can be viewed from multiple angles. Players have more animation than ever before, with new moves including sliding challenges and close-control trapping. Goalkeepers now have a level of human control.</desc>

		<desc>FIFA 2003 continues the trend of improving each year's new release by keeping the formula that worked, while also adding new features to make the game more enjoyable.

Some of these new features including a "Freestyle" control, which is activated by the right thumbstick, causing you to do special moves, such as a deke, or kick the ball a fair length forwards to gain some speed.

New and improved "dead ball" control makes corner kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and gives you more options. The passing game has been improved as to allow better passing by kicking directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in particular, or open passing to allow anybody to take it.

FIFA 2003 includes all FIFA clubs, leagues, and players.</desc>

		<desc>Based on a movie by the same name, The Fifth Element is a third-person adventure wherein you take on the persona of one of two characters. Your two choices stem from the two main ones from the movie, Korben Dallas or Leeloo Minai Lekatariba-Lamina-Tchai Ekbat.
 Korben, played by Bruce Willis in the film, is a cab driver. He lives in New York City when the game starts, and he is the one man capable of saving the world.
 Leeloo is The Fifth Element. She is the only hope that the universe has against Pure Evil.
 The story goes that every five thousand years a door is opened between dimensions. One dimension is our universe, and the other is the anti-universe. This universe is known as Pure Evil, and waits for the doors to open, since every five thousand years the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, water) are gathered around the fifth the perfect being (Leeloo).
 The two characters have different options available to them. Korben can use guns, while Leeloo can use grenades. This helps you in certain aspects of the game, and choosing your character wisely can mean the difference between life and death.</desc>

		<desc>Great fighters are made, not born! That's the underlying concept behind Agetec's new brawler/construction kit Fighter Maker, a quasi-game that's sure to have amateur game programmers squealing in delight. Is Virtua Fighter not your style? Does Tekken make you sick? Then take on the world and design your own hardy crew of fighters and then pit them against your best buddy's!
			Fighter Maker features a complete 3D character posing system -- think of it as a simplified version of Kinetix's Character Studio R2 for 3D Studio MAX. But you'll need to sit down and read the manual to make your fighters look good as the construction kit is a powerful one, and you may get bogged down in the sheer number of choices you have to make.</desc>

Though the game advertised very interactive places, they all ended up in rectangular arenas because of an invisible wall which surrounded them. There was no way to walk around freely.</desc>

		<desc>Human cloning was banned by international treaty at the end of the twentieth century. There are those who disobey the law by taking part in the biotechnology and cloning black market. One such group, the Knackmiche Corporation, is on the verge of creating the world's first artificial life form. Their goal is to create a soldier capable of surviving in any environment and one who fights without conscience.
 The State Intelligence Police (SI-COPS) was created to stop such international crimes. Recruiting operatives from the CIA, FBI, and Interpol, SI-COPS is composed of the world's greatest agents. After years of investigation into the Knackmiche Corporation, SI-COPS now has enough information to send in an agent. Hawk Manson, one of SI-COPS' top operatives, has been selected to infiltrate the Knackmiche Corporation and erase all sensitive data. Key personnel must also be eliminated.
 Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of this mission, SI-COPS will not acknowledge any involvement in the mission. If Hawk makes any mistakes, he is on his own. He will have to depend on his own skills to complete the mission and safely escape.</desc>

		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.
 As young Zidane Tribal and his party interrupted a renowned play and kidnapped Princess Garnet Til Alexandros, things began to fall apart. The queen fired cannons and decimated her kingdom in an attempt to prevent the terrorist organization, but her attacks failed and the troupe escaped with their lives intact.
 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

 Princess Garnet wished someone would take her away from her oppressing mother and life; the only world she knew was that of Alexandria and its large metropolitan areas. Zidane Tribal and his troupe had come at the perfect time. An innocent black mage known as Vivi Orunitia and a Pluto Knight named Adelbert Steiner, who was sworn to protect the princess at all costs, were also part of the crusade.
 Although Adelbert Steiner had objections, the characters formed a pact to overthrow Queen Brahne and prevent her harmful attack in the surrounding areas of Alexandria. After the princess was abducted, Brahne hired assailants to create destructive black mage warriors. With a few of her knights and the mages, the queen unleashed a series of unmitigated attacks on neighboring towns -- she would do anything to recapture Princess Garnet.
 But what are the queen's true intentions?</desc>

		<desc>Corruption -- the root of all evil. Alexandria's Queen Brahne was once presented as a noble and caring ruler, who would throw lavish festivals to show appreciation for her supporters. Recently, she became involved in secretive deals with mysterious people. Matters took a turn for the worse when a renegade troupe kidnapped her daughter and changed the fate of a once peaceful world.

		<desc>The Elemental Crystals...the life source of the planet. With them, gentle winds blow, the seas are active, fire burns bright, and the earth is full of life. All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.

Meanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!

Final Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!

Final Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.</desc>

Set in a fantasy world with a technology level equivalent to that of the Second Industrial Revolution, the game's story focuses on a group of rebels as they seek to overthrow an imperial dictatorship. The game features fourteen permanent playable characters, the most of any game in the main series. Final Fantasy VI was the first game in the series to be directed by someone other than producer and series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi; the role was filled instead by Yoshinori Kitase and Hiroyuki Ito. Yoshitaka Amano, a long-time contributor to the Final Fantasy series, returned as the image and character designer, while regular composer Nobuo Uematsu wrote the game's score, which has been released on several soundtrack albums.</desc>

		<desc>What begins as a carefree day at the Millennial Fair for a young man named Crono turns into his ultimate adventure. When Crono meets a young girl named Marle, little does he realize that this young girl, his best friend Lucca's invention, and a mysterious pendant will thrust him into the ultimate trip through time and space, encountering new friends, defeating the forces of evil, and encountering the one who would destroy the flow of time.

Chrono Trigger is a role-playing game, with the usual game mechanics fare for such: the player takes control of a variably large party, developing the combat skills of its members and managing their equipment. As the characters grow in power, not only their ability scores increase, but they also learn new "Techs" - special powerful attacks and maneuvers which cost them "Magic Points" to use in battle. 

The game utilizes the ATB (active time battle) combat system from  Final Fantasy games - sort of a mix of turn-based and real-time combat -  adding to it combo attacks. Apart from normal Techs, it is possible to use Double and Triple Techniques - super-powerful attacks which involve two or three characters using their abilities at once. There are no random battles in the game, as all the enemies are visible on screen, and it's even possible to just pass by them entirely. 

The game allows you to face your ultimate adversary at different points of time, which leads to several different endings. There is also a New Game+ option, which allows you to carry over your powerful characters to a new game, and adds even more endings to the already existing ones.</desc>

		<desc>Final Fantasy Tactics is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Square (now Square Enix) for the Sony PlayStation video game console. It is the first game of the Final Fantasy Tactics series and was released in Japan in June 1997 and in the United States in January 1998. The game combines thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. In contrast to other 32-bit era Final Fantasy titles, Final Fantasy Tactics uses a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters.</desc>

Like the Little Max character from Mike Tyson's Punch Out, you are a transparent fisherman. You can go from "fishin' hole" to "fishin' hole" according to your preference. All of the spots are different in their variety of species. You also get to pick your own lure, ranging from poppers and worms to jerk bait. All lures produce different results, so choose wisely.

Choices for play include: the Beginner mode, where you are given a tutorial during which you're taught the rules of the game; Free Fishing mode, where you can just catch fish at your leisure; Tournament mode, where you must qualify at each of the three lakes to get to the main event; Versus Play, where you compete against another player; and World Monsters mode, where you fish for monster-sized fish through fake environments.

Big Ol' Bass supports vibration feedback, analog control, one block of memory and the SLUH-00063 special controller.</desc>

Empire Interactive has done just that in Ford Racing. In addition to the classic Taurus or Mustang, players may also choose to race a GT90, an Explorer, an F-Series, or one of several concept cars. In all, twelve different vehicles are available to players in Ford Racing.
 The game features ten racetracks and a couple of different modes of play. Single-player and multiplayer races are available, as well as a career mode. Career mode allows players to race for sponsors, improving their vehicles with a share of the prize money. With continued success and sufficient winnings, players may eventually build up enough of a financial base to sponsor their own racing teams and compete at the world-class level.</desc>

		<desc>In Formula 1: Championship Edition, players select from 13 Formula 1 teams, 17 different circuits, and a variety of spec cars. To avoid crashes designed after real crash footage, players must navigate their car in and around the competition while maintaining high speeds. Gamers can select from three different modes of play including "Training," "Single Race," and "Championship," and then adjust such options as race length, skill settings, steer assist, brake assist, and sessions. Players can also adjust the setting of their cars and may choose to alter the gears, tires, suspension, brakes, and the front and rear down force. Two players can compete in split-screen multiplayer action.</desc>

		<desc>An UK developed racing game based on 1999's Formula One Season. Every team and pilot is registered, as well as all 16 courses including the new (at the time) Sepang track at Malaysia.

Gameplay tends to go towards arcade action rather than simulations, as there are not many customization options and maneuvers such as drafting are useless thanks to the physics engine.
Supports quick race and season gameplay in both simulation and arcade modes, as well as multiplayer support for up to 8 players.

Graphics are entirely 3d with weather effects included and the game features commentary by BBC commentator Murray Walker.</desc>

		<desc>Earth has been rendered largely uninhabitable by an explosion caused by a bungled experiment. Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last.

Forsaken is a first-person shoot 'em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. 

On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.</desc>

		<desc>NHL Championship 2000 is a hockey game licensed by the NHL, NHLPA and the FOX Sports channel, which allowed the developers to use not only the likeness of their broadcasting graphics and the Fox Trax technology, but also the voice support of game broadcasters John Davidson and Kenny Albert.

One of the key aspects of the game are the passing indicators, which always show which players are open for a pass, allowing a quick, smooth passing play. Advanced puck physics allow for realistic offensive play.

Using 1999/2000 rosters, NHL Championship 2000 includes all NHL teams (including the expansion team Atlanta Trashers and All-Star teams) and 18 international teams. The season length can be defined, ranging from the bare minimum (27 games) to a full 82 games season. Player creation and trade is also possible, as well as multiplayer games.</desc>

		<desc>Baseball player Frank Thomas licensed one of the first baseball games to use motion-captured 3D graphics and multiple camera angles. 28 stadia have been rendered in 3D, and each has its own visible and significant differences.
 There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points.
 You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</desc>

		<desc>Freestyle Motocross: McGrath vs. Pastrana not only combines two of the sport's biggest stars, but also the two unique styles of motocross into one game. The game seeks to combine both freestyle and motocross into one event.
 Players race amongst four other riders, taking on a twisted track with plenty of places to catch air, but they won't just be jockeying for the head of the pack. They'll also have to mix some tricks into their run, because position is not only determined by where you are in the pack, but how stylish and challenging your run is in terms of stunts. There are over 30 tricks in all to keep you occupied.
 There are ten different tracks for you to challenge in Freestyle Motocross, ranging from predictable locations such as Las Vegas to more exotic locales like Tombstone and Loch Ness. Each track is built to suit both speed and tricks, alternating between straight-aways and bumpy terrain perfect for executing a combo or holding that trick for just a moment longer in order to score bigger points.
 Of course, if the racing aspect of the game isn't your cup of tea, you can also switch to a plain Freestyle mode where the only goal is to do tricks and score points - perfect for those who like to cut out everything but the basics. You can also choose to play a Single Race or run some Time Trials. And if you get tired of playing by yourself, grab a friend and go head to head in Multiplayer mode.
 Features:
 # Racing mode
 # Freestyle mode
 # Pull off big tricks
 # Race on a variety of tracks
 # Challenge a friend to some action</desc>

		<desc>Front Mission 3 is the third main entry and the fifth entry overall in the Front Mission series. Like other Front Mission titles, Front Mission 3 is part of a serialized storyline that follows the stories of various characters and their struggles involving mecha known as wanzers.
While it is a tactical role-playing game, there is a stronger emphasis on role-playing elements as opposed to strategic elements in Front Mission 3. The game progresses in a linear manner: watch cut-scene events, complete missions, set up wanzers during intermissions, and sortie for the next mission. The player travels to locations on a world map. As the player progresses through the plot, new locations are revealed on the world map. Towns and cities act as intermission points where the player can organize and set up their units for the upcoming mission. New to Front Mission 3 is the Double Feature Scenario - this allows the player to experience two different scenarios that exist independently of one another within the game's storyline. In other words, the player can play through two stories; while they may share common events and environments, the stories are largely unique and in essence are fully-fledged games.</desc>

		<desc>G-Darius revolves around a conflict between the humanoids of Amnelia and cyborg/chimera biovessels known as the "Thiima" (meant to mean simply "bringers of death"). The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots "Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen" are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.</desc>

The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.

G-Police is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo. Missions require you to navigate through the skyscrapers and billboards of the various city districts, and complete a number of objectives updated through radio contact with headquarters.</desc>

The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.

G-Police is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo. Missions require you to navigate through the skyscrapers and billboards of the various city districts, and complete a number of objectives updated through radio contact with headquarters.</desc>

		<desc>Taking place only ten days after the events in the original G-Police, the sequel G-Police: Weapons of Justice centers around a group of small gangs in Callisto. The various gangs are taking advantage of the G-Police by exploiting their weakened and exhausted task force. With crime back on the rise, the city will have to pull through and pray for a miracle --- fortunately, they're prayers have been answered.

After an attempt to silence the terrorist organizations, your squad receives word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately, they're a few days away from the city and the G-Police can't keep things under control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival.

When the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city -- things are already too late. Those small gangs have turned into full-blown crime syndicates making the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the upper hand -- the G-Police uses a variety of five attack choppers including the Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines have supplied their Corsair cruise ship, Raptor, and Rhino --- a giant mechanized robot used for mass destruction and a heavily armed patrol vehicle, respectively.</desc>

		<desc>Gallop Racer is part horse racing simulation, part action/arcade racer.

When choosing horses for your stable, you have to take a lot of factors into account. For instance, is the horse a long or short distance runner? Does it do better on a dry track or a wet track? The factors appear to be endless at first.

After you have your horse, you then get to race it. Unlike several horse racing games from this time, you get to control the horse on the track instead of just watching. Actually, you really control the jockey. The controls basically boil down to hitting the face buttons when you need to get the horse moving; similar to riding the horse in The Ocarina of Time, only without the turning. However, you can't drive the horse on for the entire race, or else it'll tire and you'll be left in the dust.

Once the race is over, you get your cash. Each place earns you a specific amount, which you can then use to improve your ranks of race horses. If you'd rather not spend more money, you can also breed them, creating a "super racing horse" from two exceptional racers. The horse isn't really super, but it will almost certainly have a prolific career.</desc>

		<desc>The Game of Life on PlayStation is a translation of Parker Brothers' popular board game that has players deciding on such issues as marriage, home ownership, college, insurance, careers, and even starting a family. Each player (up to six can play at once) is given $10,000 to start, with the goal being to earn as much money for "retirement" as possible.
 You'll first have to choose between college or starting a career, and subsequent turns involve spinning a wheel, moving your car token along the board, following directions on the space, and making decisions to maximize your earnings. The PlayStation version offers a 3D game board and your choice of car tokens and characters to play as or against.
 The game also features a unique "car cam" perspective, allowing you to see through your token's windshield, and an announcer to keep things moving along. Other enhancements include a soundtrack reflecting the game's different time periods, hundreds of board animations, and both analog controller and memory card support.
 Features:
 Play the classic game or an enhanced version
 Compete against up to five friends or family members
 Soundtrack features music from the 1950s to the 1990s</desc>

 Wait just a minute -- we all know that good wizards never die, they just teleport to another dimension! Such is the case with Gauntlet Legends, the 1998 Arcade update to the original 1985 coin-op game that featured four-player simultaneous action set within a fantasy setting. The four character classes (warrior, wizard, valkyrie and archer) have returned in full 3D, but this time they have a few friends! Yet before you can use the new characters, you'll have to first find them during the course of play.</desc>

		<desc>In the time of New Tokyo, a time in which corruption and criminal behavior is at an all time high, a girl named Angela has been kidnapped. Her parents have hired a detective named Travis to investigate a gang run by the notorious crime boss Kintaro; some say the gang is involved with the darker side of life, namely Hell. Knowing how difficult the mission is, the detective will need all the assistance he can get.
 Joining Travis on his brutal and bloody quest is an old friend named Michelle, a martial arts mentor known as Ushi and his student, Tetsuo. You and up to three friends will control these characters (simultaneously) through Gekido: Urban Fighters -- a side scrolling 3D beat 'em up in the vein of Final Fight and Streets of Rage. Like the aforementioned games, each fighter handles differently; whereas Travis is the well-balanced brawler, Michelle excels in speed but lacks in power. In addition to the four selectable characters, there are two hidden fighters to unlock with extended gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>In the tradition of Tetris and Welltris comes Geom Cube, a puzzle game in which players maneuver 3D blocks as they fall into a pit. The twist is that players are looking down from a view directly above the pit. Each falling block can be rotated on its axis, allowing for a variety of ways to fit the puzzle pieces together. The objective is to create a solid plane of blocks in order to prevent others from piling up to the top of the playfield. Creating a plane of blocks without gaps (called a "face") causes the blocks on that plane to disappear. There are 24 different block patterns in all, each composed of one to five cubes.</desc>

One night as he was feeding his addiction, the television went blank and a large hand grabbed the gecko, sucking him into the Media Dimension. Why? An evil fly named Rez wants Gex as the network's new mascot! The gecko's mission is to destroy the various television sets and collect enough remote controls to escape with his life intact. He must also abolish Rez once and for all!
 With his powerful tail-whip and lethal tongue lash attacks, Gex will recover hidden remote controls in television inspired levels including a Frankenstein driven Graveyard World, Cartoon World, Jungle World and a Kung Fu World filled with ninjas and sumo wrestlers before battling the evil Rez in his insane Nerve Center.</desc>

		<desc>"Is it just me, or am I engulfed in flames?" is one of the many one-liners uttered by Gex, a wise cracking gecko who should check himself into television rehab; he's addicted to it. After saving the Television Realm from the evil Rez in his first adventure, the gecko was ready to kick back, relax, and watch a little television. Little did he know his adventure was just beginning.
 One day, two secret agent goons showed up at Gex's doorstep. They inform him that Rez is back and looking for vengeance; the evil monster is planning to destroy the Television Realm once more...and possibly the world. When Gex tells them that he's retired and doesn't care, one of the goons hits the gecko on the head and takes him to a secluded place.
 When Gex comes to, the mystery men plead with the gecko to take the cash and help destroy Rez for good...or at least make him disappear. With that incentive (the cash), the wise cracking lizard slips into his special agent suit and plunges headfirst into the Television Realm. Watch out, Rez -- Gex is back!</desc>

 Taking place in the Crystal Kingdom, a well-natured wizard was mixing a new potion and got some rather explosive results. After a large eruption rocked the castle, his magical gloves flew from his hands and he was instantly turned to stone. As a result of the experiment gone awry, seven power crystals that hold the kingdom in balance were dispersed throughout the land.
 Assuming the role of the animate glove, you'll go through exotic and complex worlds to locate the seven crystals that have taken on a rubber ball form. Glover's objective is to guide the crystals to safety by maneuvering them throughout the various worlds. It won't be easy however -- the Evil Glove is waiting in the wings to thwart the noble glove's attempt to bring peace and happiness back into the Crystal Kingdom.</desc>

		<desc>A Soccer game. All of the World Cup games are represented in Goal Storm, and respond according to actual team performance. For example, Brazil is much better than, say, Canada. The game looks good, even if the players are a bit simply designed. The control is solid and relatively intuitive, the only major problem being the placement of the defensive tackle and goal shot on the same button. There's even the obligatory announcer, calling plays and adding that much heralded element of realism to the game, very popular in today's sports games.
			The game is known as World Soccer Winning Eleven and is the first game in the acclaimed Pro Evolution Soccer series.</desc>

		<desc>Gran Turismo is fundamentally based on the racing simulator genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.

However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.

Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They can be found in the North American version's code (and are unlockable via a GameShark cheat device). In addition to the hidden del Sols, there is also a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1998 Mazda Roadster exclusive to Arcade mode. The Corvette and Roadster can also be accessed via GameShark.</desc>

		<desc>Grand Slam Baseball was an innovative, albeit relatively low-key release from Virgin Interactive Entertainment in 1997.
 Not known for sports games, VIE released Grand Slam for Windows, Sony Playstation and Sega Saturn as the second title in its attempt to establish a mainstream sports line. The first title in the short-lived line was Power Play Hockey in 1996. The sports line would last only one more title after Grand Slam's release, that being the sequel to the hockey game, also released in 1997.


 Grand Slam was one of the early adopters of 3D accelerator card technology and also offered full 3D play in software alone. The Playstation and Saturn versions were 3D by default.
 Grand Slam introduced a few play mechanics to video game baseball that would later prove to be fixtures in the genre. The most notable in this area was the introduction of a meter for pitching, used to control the velocity and accuracy of pitches, similar to the familiar swing meter in popular golf games. This meter was later borrowed and made popular by titles such as EA's MVP Baseball. On the batting side of things, a similar metered approach was used. This was inspired by older arcade baseball games that allowed the player to load up a swing's power with a control stick before releasing it as the pitch came in.</desc>

		<desc>In Grand Theft Auto, you assume the role of a street thug working for an organized syndicate of criminals that specializes in stealing cars. Every time your pager beeps, the boss needs you to steal something for him -- if you don't get to a payphone and answer the message, you'll be in hot water (or is that cold water at the bottom of the East River).
 After receiving your mission, you'll have to navigate city streets that are bustling with pedestrians, cops (your worst enemies), and traffic jams. Because you're pressed for time, you can't just walk to your destination on foot -- that would take too long. Instead, you'll have to go car jacking, the art of physically removing people out of their vehicles and stealing it.





 This is the premise behind Grand Theft Auto, an overhead action game of thievery. There are four large cities in which you'll have to steal cars, shoot rival gang members, and complete missions for the boss. Each mission requires you to get something from point "A" to point "B". For example, the head honcho wants to pull off a bank heist -- instead of using regular cars, they want you to steal a couple taxicabs for them. This way, the cops won't be able to find them as easily in traffic.</desc>

		<desc>The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.

Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.

New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</desc>

		<desc>Grand Theft Auto: Mission Pack #1 - London 1969 is an official expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto. Instead of the fictional interpretations of New York, Miami and Los Angeles of the original, this game opens up the city of London to the player. The game features thirty new vehicles, new graphics and thirty-two new missions; all in a distinctly British theme. The new city contains many familiar landmarks from London in the late 60s as well as other cultural reference and Cockney slang. This time the player can choose the avatar's appearance, otherwise gameplay has not been changed from the original game. The player still is involved in organized crime and must perform a variety of criminal activities.</desc>

		<desc>Grandia is a Japanese-style console RPG, with big-eyed anime style characters, that was first released on the Sega Saturn in 1997.  It centers around the story of a young hero named Justin who possesses a mysterious artifact known as the 'Spirit Stone'.  The story takes Justin and friends (who range from a bratty eight year-old to a noble knight and a thief with a short fuse) through distant towns and abandoned ruins of a forgotten civilization (and even the occasional military base) in a search for adventure and secrets long hidden from the world. Grandia makes use of FMV cut-scenes to advance the story.

The characters are represented by 2D sprites which are moved around over 3D backgrounds in towns and dungeons.  Combat is initiated by coming into contact with enemies on the screen, rather than through random battles.  Combat itself occurs in pseudo-real-time, using an 'IP Gauge' to determine when a character takes action. Striking at the right time or with the right ability can even delay or cancel an enemy's turn.

The characters in the game gradually advance in level as they gain experience points for killing monsters. Characters also gain experience based on the weapon (e.g. sword, mace, whip, etc.) or magic (e.g. fire, water, etc.) that they use, powering up their spells and learning new ones from continuous usage.  There are a large number of spells, weapons, and other items to use throughout the game.</desc>

		<desc>One hundred years ago, the planet of Granstream was ravaged by a war between the Imperial Wizardry and the Allied Spirit Army. To break the deadlock, the Imperial Wizardry unleashed a forbidden weapon long since banned by both sides, causing the planet's axis to shift and flooding the world in the process. Four wise men, aligned to the elements of fire, water, earth, and wind, managed to raise four continents into the air, saving those they could. Now however, the descendants of the wise men responsible for this noble act have begun disappearing and reports emerge that Imperial airships have been spotted. Raised by a kindly man by the name of Valos, it falls to Eon, a young orphaned boy whose wrist is adorned by a mysterious bracelet called a Scepter, to save the continents.
 A 3D polygonal RPG, The Granstream Saga presents players with the usual allotment of items, weapons, and equipment, the collection of which is necessary should Eon have a chance of saving the continents of Shilf, Aquas, Volcos, and Zephere. On his journey, Eon will be accompanied by two woman, Laramee and Arcia, and a bird named Korky, though only he will engage in battle. Movement throughout the world is viewed from an overhead perspective, while battles take place in real-time 3D. The battles, which consist primarily of one-on-one duels, allow players full control over the character's movement within the confines of the battle area. Magic and melee attacks provide the necessary offensive capabilities, though if required the player can use a shield to block enemy attacks or evade them by double-tapping the directional pad in a specific direction. Special abilities can be learned and subsequently implemented during battles, many of which are unique to the weapon type your character currently wields.
 Once learned, these skills can be executed with the proper D-pad movements. Daggers, axes, and short and long swords can be used in battle, each with unique damage potential and speed of use. Enemies can been seen in the overworld, and thus battles avoided at the whim of the player. Interspersed between the battles are puzzles that require solving before the player can progress. Critical junctures in the plot unfold via animated cutscenes, and hand-drawn character portraits accompany conversations with significant characters in the game.

		<desc>Grid Runner is a futuristic version of "tag." On offense, your objective is to capture the flags around the levels without being tagged or killed. On defense, your main objective is to tag the other player (either the computer or a friend in two-player mode) before he or she collects all the flags.
 In each level you will find different colored balls that will help you defeat your enemies. For example, the green balls increase your speed, red increases your magic, and blue increases your agility. The more power-ups you collect, the more efficient you become. You can also use and collect magic points.
 Collecting magic points allows you to do one of six things: build a temporary bridge, drop explosives behind you, slow down your opponent, fire a weapon (which can be upgraded or traded), temporarily boost your speed, or teleport out of danger.</desc>

		<desc>This version of The Grinch is based on the 2000 holiday movie of the same title, inspired by the Dr. Seuss book and animated special How the Grinch Stole Christmas. PlayStation gamers control The Grinch and his dog Max, swapping between the two with a tap of a button. The troublemakers attempt to stop Christmas from taking place by causing mischief and destroying all the presents, snowmen, and Christmas trees they find.
 The villain's driving motivation is to collect blueprints to build an arsenal of inventions that he needs to ruin the Who-ville holidays once and for all. He'll search through four large areas of 3D platforming that emphasize exploration and puzzle-solving challenges. Will the furry green grump really be able to foul the festivities, or will he find that "maybe Christmas... perhaps... means a little bit more"?
 Features:
 - Third-person action-adventure game in which gamers play Mean One himself
 - Combines puzzles, nonviolent action, item collection, and exploration
 - 24 missions, from Whoville to Ocean Floor
 - 4 Seussian environments, with 3 minigames and 1 bonus level
 - Weapons include rotten-egg launcher, slime shooter, bad breath, and GrinchCopter</desc>

		<desc>In the future, gang warfare is settled between gangs by using advanced armored vehicles. A mysterious figure called the Crimelord has set up a tournament on a secluded island dubbed "The Death Ring"  to get all the gangs to fight each other to earn his favor. It's up to the player to take their gang to the top by infiltrating all the opposing gang's bases of operation and take out their network of power generators which will effectively cripple those opposing factions.

Gameplay is centered around vehicular combat. Bases are defended by enemy vehicles, gun turrets, and mortars which harass the player while they are searching for the power generators to destroy. Players choose a vehicle (which represents a gang) with each coming with their own distinctive weapons such as shield draining bombs, energy megabolts, corrosive sulfur gas bombs and, mini-thermonuclear warheads. Each of the 23 missions contain power-ups such as invulnerability, invisibility, double damage, nitro boosts, and guided missile lock jammers. Powerups are earned after collecting a number of tokens scattered throughout each mission.

There is also a 2 player split screen combat mode where two players can fight against each other.</desc>

		<desc>Guardian's Crusade starts off innocently enough: The mayor wants you to deliver a letter to a nearby town, and being a fine young knight, you agree and head on your way. But how could you know that you are taking the first step on a grand journey that will decide the fate of the entire world?
 On your way back from the town, you discover a pink monster known as Baby and receive an ominous message about a place called God's Tower. Taking care of Baby is just one of the many problems you'll face as you fight the forces of evil.</desc>

		<desc>Gubble is a cute, colorful alien and he needs your help to get back to his home in this PlayStation game. It seems that creatures of Gubble's kind are particularly adept at loosening screws, nails, rivets, and other such fasteners. So adept, in fact, that Gubble has been kidnapped and sent to a dangerous planet to ply this skill. His captors have instructed him to unfasten the screws and bolts on a large enemy ship, promising to return him to his home if he is successful.
 Success will take good puzzle-solving skills though (and perhaps a little luck), as the falling pieces from the unfastened ship could put a quick end to Gubble's efforts. Not to mention the enemy creatures, who would rather their high-tech equipment remain in one piece.
 Features:
 * Use a variety of gadgets to help get Gubble home
 * A dozen challenging levels
 * Locate the Magic Ring to earn bonus time</desc>

		<desc>This is a 2D fighting game. You get to choose from 10 different characters in Guilty Gear, each with his or her own set of moves and special attacks. Moves are carried out in typical fighting game style (button combinations) and the game handles very well. All the characters are pretty much balanced and fair except some moves are a bit too excessive. A few characters can execute attacks that really take off way too much damage and this is real the problem with the game.</desc>

		<desc>This game is the follow-up to Gundam: The Battle Master. Heero Yuy, the pilot of a Mobile Suit Wing Gundam is on a mission to destroy the remaining enemy Mobile Suits, who are under the command of Treize Khushrenada, in order to stop a war from starting. In the story mode, Heero can pilot any of the available mobile suits to do battle with his enemies. Each suit has its own set of special moves and a super attack. Some of the weapon based special attacks use ammunition which can eventually run out. The super attack can only be used 3 times during each fight. Each suit also has thrusters that can be used to fly in the air a bit. On the defensive side, players can dodge attacks by sidestepping and also can utilize a beam shield which can be used to protect the player from projectile attacks. Mobile suits come with 3 life bars total and fights are decided by trying to deplete all the life bars of an enemy mobile suit.

The game also contains a 2 player versus mode. 

Options allow the player to choose their difficulty level and also let them set the timer during a match to either on or off.</desc>

		<desc>Gundam Battle Assault 2 is an one-on-one fighting game, based on the popular anime series "Mobile Suit Gundam" and its various offshoots. You can play as the titular Gundams (giant walking robots) from a wide variety of series. The game features standard fighting game mechanics, with punches, kicks and a variety of combo moves that can be executed by each Gundam. Note that the Mobile Suits aren't as mobile as humans, and thus the fighters' movements are slower and their maneuverability is worse than in most fighting games. 

The game has several playing modes, which must be unlocked by using different Mobile Suits on the various difficulty levels. The available modes are: street mode, story mode, versus (a single duel where you can choose your opponent), two time attack modes (where you must defeat either 8 regular enemies or 4 boss enemies as fast as possible) and survival (defeat as many enemies as possible; fight until you beat all of them, or until one of them beats you.)</desc>

		<desc>An update to Gunship 2000. This updated game now includes full textures on all 3D objects. The game features two game modes. The Quick Fire game mode has the player piloting a helicopter, trying to take out as many enemy targets as they can.

There is also a campaign mode where players can tackle various day and night missions in either Central Europe or the Persian Gulf. Missions range from destroying enemy convoys to taking out enemy platoons. Players start out as a greenhorn and can only do training or single scenario missions at first. The player can eventually get promoted to campaign scenario missions where they can also get to control a complete squad of five copters.

The game features flyable versions of the AH-64A Apache, UH-60K Blackhawk, AH-66B Comanche and four other authentic U.S. Army attack helicopters. Copters can be equipped with unguided weapons like rockets and machine guns and guided weapons like Hellfire, Sidewinder, and Stinger missiles which are used to take out both air and ground targets. Copters can be flown from either a cockpit view or from a chase view. The game also has other camera views such as the remote view or the tactical view.</desc>

		<desc>Accolade's HardBall 5 comes to the PlayStation with a full MLBPA license. Based on the 1994 baseball season, the license gives players over 800 actual players, all of the major league teams (in addition to twelve of the all time greatest dynasties), and 40 different stadiums modeled after their real-life counterparts.
 Gameplay options include League Play, Batting Practice, Exhibition Game, Pitching Practice, and the Home Run Derby. Exhibition matches are single-player games in which two teams compete for fun and/or practice. Batting and Pitching Practices are essential to any new HardBall 5 players. They'll get you used to controlling the action, judging ball trajectories, and selecting pitches.
 In League Play, players are given the option to play a shortened or full-length season (162 games) using their favorite team. As the team's manager you'll set player lineups, judge which hitters would be better against a right-handed pitcher, make substitutions, and send the runner home after a deep fly ball to right field!
 In Home Run Derby players compete against a variety of computer-controlled opponents or another human opponent. The idea is to hit more home runs than your competitors.
 HardBall 5 features 10 different skill levels and play-by-play commentary courtesy of Al Michaels. Season progress and various statistics can be saved via Memory Card.</desc>

Things do not go smoothly, however, as the game closely follows the events found in J.K. Rowling's second book in the international best-selling fantasy series. Harry Potter and friends Hermione and Ron must investigate a terrible danger: students are mysteriously turning to stone.
 Developed by Argonaut Software, this PlayStation version offers a completely different experience than the games on other platforms. Play begins at Ron's home at the Burrow, where Harry can practice his magic skills in a number of tasks designed to help the Weasley homestead. </desc>

		<desc>Hi-Octane was originally released for the PC. It combines classic futuristic shooters like Defender and Nintendo's StarFox with fast paced racing titles such as The Need for Speed or Pole Position. Many reviewers regarded it, however, as a rip-off of Psygnosis' now classic WipeOut.
 Hi-Octane is a futuristic 3D racer featuring six unique hover-cars. Like many racing games, each vehicle varies in the areas of speed, attack power, and maneuverability; the KD-1 Speeder is a great all around car whereas Jugga is slower but packs a wallop in shields and firepower. Firepower comes in the form of mini-guns and rockets while pickups include weapon ammunition, boosts, and invincibility.</desc>

		<desc>The 3DO Company's first PlayStation baseball game is the sequel to High Heat Baseball, released exclusively for the PC in 1998. Although the original featured sprite-based player graphics and generic team names, High Heat Baseball 2000 sports 3D polygonal players, a Major League Baseball license and authentic players with statistics based on the 1998 season. High Heat Baseball 2000 also includes all 30 teams and ballparks from 1998 as well as seven additional stadiums: Ebbets Field, Polo Grounds, Safeco Park, Houston Stadium, Miller Park, Pacific Bell Park and Modesto Field.
 Batting involves swinging as the ball approaches the plate while using the directional pad to aim the bat. Players are free to swing anywhere within the strike zone by pushing the pad toward the location of the incoming pitch. Pitching also involves using the directional pad; first select a pitch by pushing the pad in one of five directions, then aim the ball over the strike zone. While players have seven pitches to choose from, not all pitchers can throw with the same ability. If you try to throw something that's not in your player's repertoire, don't be surprised when he shakes off the pitch!</desc>

Players choose one of several classically styled muscle cars and hot rods to drive in freewheelin' races across the good ol' U. S. of A. Winners receive the singular reward of a chance to "hang out" with attractive Hooters Girls waitress characters, known to patrons of the owl-mascotted restaurant chain for their friendly service and distinguishingly informal "short shorts and short shirt" uniforms.
 The game features well over a dozen different automobiles, though many of these must be "unlocked" by skillful play. Races take place across the country in such fair weather locations as Florida and California. In the words of the restaurant's own slogan, "Delightfully Tacky, Yet Unrefined."</desc>

		<desc>Utilizing a host of new gameplay elements, Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth expands upon the formula made popular by the cult classic Final Fantasy Tactics. The continent of Mardias serves as the game's primary world, and is divided into three kingdoms: Nightweld, the Valaimian Empire and Gerauld. The story begins as Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom. Lacking the military might to repel the invaders from multiple fronts, Fazz - a mercenary and the game's protagonist - is hired to defend the Tower of Wind. Needless to say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting Fazz.
 As you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy. Wait too long however and the slider will return to the beginning.</desc>

		<desc>Mattel's Hot Wheels has been one of the most popular toy franchises for boys and girls for over 30 years, on the same glorified popularity level as G.I. Joe and Barbie. Now get ready for pulse-pounding racing action as these die-cast race cars come to life on the PlayStation in Hot Wheels Turbo Racing. Developed by Stormfront Studios and published by Electronic Arts, the game features 11 twisting tracks and plenty of stunts like flips, barrel rolls and 360-degree spins.
 Get behind the wheel of over 40 classic Hot Wheels cars including The Red Baron, Twin Mill (The King of Speed) and Super Van (5,000 pounds of car-smashing terror). Each car has its own strengths and weaknesses, so you'll have to experiment to find out which one is best suited to your driving style. You'll have your choice of many different tracks, some built for all out speed and others filled with loops and obstacles to challenge your stunt mastery.
 The gameplay consists of three different race modes and two practice modes. Perfect your style in the Practice mode, where one or two players try out available tracks to get familiar with the game (and to find hidden short cuts). You can also select Practice Airtime, which is a stunt training mode that allows you to try out different tracks to perfect your stunt and trick maneuvers. Then earn points in the Exhibition Race where you go head-to-head with a friend or a number of computer-controlled opponents in an all-out race. This includes Airtime Challenge, a one or two-player stunt battle, and the Hot Wheels Cup, which is a racing tournament event made up of a series of tracks. The better you perform in each race the more points you'll score. The driver with the most points at the end of the tournament will win.
 The game's tracks feature hidden cars, shortcuts and power-ups at various points along the courses. Power-ups include a Car of Steel that gives your vehicle maximum durability, spin-increasing Gyros that make stunt maneuvering easier, the bouncy Rubber Car, the power, handling and grip increasing Super Handling, Turbo Boosts and the 4X4 pickup that allows you to go off-road.
 Turbo Boosts play an important role in the game. This power allows you to blow away your opponents with an incredible boost of speed in addition to increasing your airtime for pulling off more impressive stunts. As you collect Turbo Boosts throughout the game, they will register on your onscreen Turbo Meter. You must use this power cautiously and at the right t</desc>

There are no championships to race for or time trials to beat. Simply choose your track, select a boat, and head out to the water.
			While no special modes of play exist, there are tracks and boats to be unlocked. Hydro Thunder allows players access to three boats and three tracks at the start of the game. New boats will be released depending on your finish on each of the three tracks. A player must finish in one of the top three positions on each track for new boats to become available. Boats each have their own advantages in areas such as control, stability, and speed.
			Tracks are released in the same way as boats. A top three finish in each of the first three available tracks is needed in order to unlock new tracks. On the new tracks a top two finish will be required and so on. No difficulty settings are featured in Hydro Thunder but when new tracks are released they will contain an increased difficulty level. The first three tracks are considered easy, the next three medium, and the three after that hard.</desc>

		<desc>Intelligent Qube is a classic puzzle game for the PlayStation. It is known as Kurushi in Europe and Australia. In the game, the player controls a character who must run around a platform made of cubes, capturing certain cubes as they approach. Cubes are "captured" by marking a spot on the stage, waiting for the cube to roll on top of it, and then deactivating the marked spot.
 Intelligent Qube was relatively well-received received by critics. The game performed well commercially in Japan and even won Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1997 Japan Media Arts Festival. A few sequels have been developed and the game has since been re-released on mobile phones and the Japanese PlayStation Store.

		<desc>In Cold Blood requires players to use more brains than brawn in solving a case of international intrigue, puzzle-solving, clue gathering, and the unwinding of a tangled web of espionage, double-crosses and a sinister plot that might threaten the free world. The story unwinds in an unusual manner: At the start of the game, your character, Agent John Cord, has been captured by the enemy and is in the midst of a grueling interrogation. The scenes from the game come from his memories as he is undergoing this ordeal, with players taking on his previous adventures that lead him up to this point. It is a spy-thriller in the vein of James Bond, and as Cord remembers more, the overall story begins to make more sense.

Throughout In Cold Blood, players will have to search for hidden objects and talk to a whole host of characters, attempting at every turn to solve the puzzles that pop up in their way. But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in high-octane gun battles against enemy agents. Occasionally, the player can outwit the enemies, but they'll often they'll have to fight it out in a duel to the death.</desc>

		<desc>The Dark Anarchy Society is taking over the world, destroying Earth's biggest cities in the process. As captain of an attack sub, you must seek and destroy the D.A.S.'s underwater headquarters which lie somewhere in the frigid depths of the Antarctic Circle. Your ship is equipped with machine guns and torpedoes. These weapons can be upgraded to surface-to-air missiles, smart missiles, floating mine launchers, hyper torpedoes, and supersonic torpedoes.
 While you cruise beneath the surface of the ocean, helicopters, walkers, submarines, and other vehicles of destruction release a torrent of bombs, torpedoes, and missiles, constantly assailing your ship from all sides. You've also got to watch out for ice beams that freeze all vessels within range.
 This side-scrolling shooter is composed of seven levels: The South Pole, The Channel, Seabed Ruins, Sunken Town, Deep Dark Sea, and the Enemy Base. A friend can join in for two-player simultaneous action.</desc>

		<desc>Incredible Crisis follows the stories of four members of a Japanese family on their grandmother's birthday. As each family member goes through a seemingly normal day, things start to go wrong -- very wrong. Players will be able to live out this family's hair-raising experiences by playing a series of mini-games.
 At its core, Incredible Crisis is a collection of mini-games strung together in order to advance the plot. Games range from a beatmania-style of timed gameplay (where certain buttons are pressed during certain beats) to shooting down airplanes, attacking UFOs, and even a certain "massage" level that is so analogous to a sexual experience that if gamers only heard the instructions and game mechanics, they would swear they were playing a game rated A for adult.</desc>

		<desc>Created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee for Marvel Comics in 1962, The Incredible Hulk has appeared in hundreds of comic books, a television series, a cartoon series, and a handful of made-for-television movies. His likeness, while not quite as familiar as Spider-Man's, has been featured on countless toys, action figures, games, and T-shirts.
 The Incredible Hulk - The Pantheon Saga is the big green guy's first appearance on the Sony PlayStation. In this 14 level punch-and-kickfest, he has been captured by members of the Pantheon. They intend to use his body for experimentation. As the transport ship reaches the Pantheon base, though, the ship crashes at the landing site, freeing Hulk to smash, destroy, and get revenge on his captors. Hulk can hit and kick opponents, windows, walls, and anything else that gets in his way. He is also capable of a variety of special moves including a booming Sonic Clap, a shattering Floor Smash, and a sweeping Vortex Spin.</desc>

		<desc>Independence Day envelops you in an interstellar war against resource hungry alien forces. Taking control of a hotshot fighter pilot and his wingman, Steve Hiller, your objective is to destroy a barrage of alien defense fighters while targeting massive battleships capable of obliterating entire cites. Needless to say, this won't be a stroll in the park.

As a flight combat simulation, Independence Day features a wide variety of mission objectives and exotic locations. Because the alien forces have flocked to the Grand Canyon, you'll have to destroy four generators that supply power to the City Destroyer and incapacitate the massive spaceship. The New York mission will have you abolishing satellite linkups used by the aliens as a means of communication. Of course, you'll have to eliminate the primary spaceship in that area.</desc>

		<desc>Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Crazy Maze isn't the type of game one would expect when taking on the role of the bumbling, multi-functional detective of the 1980's cartoon. Rather than an action title like its Game Boy Color counterpart, this incarnation of Inspector Gadget is best described as a puzzle game with limited action elements.

According to the story of Gadget's Crazy Maze, Inspector Gadget's mysterious arch-nemesis is up to no good once again. This time, the MADD ringleader Dr. Claw has been creating mind-control crystals on his secret moon base, then tossing them down to Earth. If the crystals lay dormant for a short amount of time, they will activate, taking control of the consciousness of the whole world. To make sure no one disturbs them, Dr. Claw has spread them all around four different areas and inserted his vile henchmen to protect them.</desc>

		<desc>International Track and Field 2 from Konami is a one-to-four player game (using the Multi Tap) that features 12 different international events, ranging from weightlifting and bicycling to canoeing. The events take place in the USA, Russia, Germany, China, Cuba, Korea, France, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and Kenya. As the sequel to the first International Track and Field video game for the PlayStation, the game features detailed faces and bodies, and motion-captured animations.

Events include men's 100-meter, one kilometer time trial (biking), sprint (cycling), singles 500-meter (canoeing), long jump, pole vault, hammer throw, javelin throw, and clean and jerk (weightlifting). It also includes women's springboard (diving), 50-meter freestyle (swimming) and horse vault. In all of the events you have to repeatedly press pairs of buttons to get your athlete to continuously perform their actions; the faster you hit them the faster your athlete will move. Other events require timed-based preciseness. Certain events like diving and horse vault allow you to choose a specific move to pull off.</desc>

		<desc>Interplay's third PlayStation baseball game brings together 750 authentic players and 30 Major League Baseball teams with ratings based on the 1998 season. Noteworthy features include updated high-resolution polygon player models with sixty signature pitching and batting styles, as well as a play-by-play announcer.
 Also new are the Tournament Mode which lets up to eight players draft their own teams, and a physics model designed to replicate realistic ball flight and pitch simulation. In addition to the Tournament, players can take part in an Exhibition game, Season, Playoffs or Home Run Derby. Statistics accumulated during the season are also saved to memory card (up to five blocks of free space is required).
 Batting involves timing the pitch as it comes toward the plate, and three difficulty settings help determine the level of control needed to perform each swing: Rookie involves just timing the pitch, Pro involves controlling the level of your swing, and All-Star requires you to control the level of your swing while the ball travels at a faster rate of speed.</desc>

		<desc>Inuyasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale is a 2D fighting game starring characters from Rumiko Takahashi's manga and anim? series, Inuyasha. The story centers around 15-year old high school student Kagome Higure, who inadvertently slips back in time to feudal Japan, where she becomes embroiled in a quest to locate shards of the Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls. "Feudal Fairy Tale," the game's main mode of play, follows this escapade and requires players to engage in a series of battles and mini-games in order to obtain the coveted shards. Initially, only Kagome and her half-demon companion Inuyasha are playable, but as players journey through the game, acquiring shards, more characters become available.
 Each character is able to perform both strong and weak attacks, as well as throws and counter attacks. Players can also execute more powerful combination maneuvers, including special and super attacks, which can only be initiated when the Spiritual meter is filled. Additionally, specific attacks can cause opponents to drop shards that, once claimed, will fill the Spiritual meter more quickly.</desc>

Choose either character and get ready to blast through eight levels spanning multiple zones: Nuclear Plant, Stark Enterprises, New York City, Rain Forest, Isle, Drill Platform, Dromak Ship and Cyberspace. Each area is filled with troops such as Spider Alien Soldiers (armed with laser blasters) and various defenses including laser turrets, cannons and electrical traps. Luckily, both characters have a few moves at their disposal to combat these threats.
 Iron Man and X-O Manowar can fire short blasts of energy from their arms, hover in the air, punch and kick, fire chest weapons, and pick up and throw objects. Since enemies will appear in both the foreground and background, you can also fire weapons on either plane! Various power-ups include first-aid kits to replenish each character's armor, one-up icons to add to their number of lives, and continue icons to let players resume progress after dying. The game also features several boss characters at the conclusion of each zone, such as Goliath, Yellowjacket, Titania, Mr. Hyde and many more.

 As in the movie, this third-person mission-based driving game challenges its heroes to weave through busy city streets, as well as down sewers and even over rooftops in efforts to confuse and elude authorities.
 The game features the movie's showpiece Mini-coopers as well as 13 other vehicles. The adventure takes place through London, Turin, and the Swiss Alps.</desc>

		<desc>Jackie Chan's grandfather has been kidnapped and it is up to you to help save him! Midway's action-platform game, Jackie Chan Stuntmaster lets you experience some of what it takes to be the internationally known martial arts actor and stunt performer. You'll play as Jackie Chan himself from a third-person perspective as you cheat death through 15 levels set within a dangerous city full of thugs. Along the way, you'll also need to retrieve a stolen package from a gang of crooks.

The crime element is not the only thing you have to deal with -- you'll also cross narrow ledges, avoid obstacles and pitfalls, and even fight on top of a speeding subway train. To accomplish these feats, you must learn how to punch, kick, jump, grab and throw multiple opponents. You also need to climb ladders, open doors, pick up objects (using some as weapons), and hang on ledges or jump off walls. Sound familiar?

In addition to the ability to push around objects, you can flip tables and chairs, causing damage to nearby enemies. Other pick-ups let your character heal (rice, milk or take-out-boxes) while others are important for your quest (red and gold dragons and extra takes). Keep in mind that some are hidden beneath boxes, crates and potted-plants that you'll need to break.</desc>

To do this, he must marry a Na'gi woman, and is betrothed to a girl named Mahbu (voiced by Michelle Ruff). On the day of a large festival in Syrus, the village is attacked by demons known as the Onibubu, which cause many villagers to fall into a deep slumber. An elderly Nagi woman, Garai, repels the Onibubu using Nagi magic before their curse affects everyone.</desc>

The game is played from a perspective behind the bike as you strive to place first while negotiating the various hills and turns that characterize the dirt-filled tracks.
 A total of four game modes are available to aspiring riders: Race, Series Mode, Time Trial and Freestyle. Race is a contest to see who is the fastest driver on your choice of tracks; after the race is over, you can choose another track and rider or move on to another mode. Series Mode is the heart of the game, where you'll be able to embark on an Indoor SuperCross, Outdoor Nationals, Combined event or your own Custom series.</desc>

		<desc>Jeremy McGrath lends his name to this Supercross racing game. Game modes include a Racing Season, Single Race, and a Ghost Racing mode.

The Racing Season mode involves the player racing against 5 opponent racers on a number of indoor or outdoor tracks trying to get first place. The higher the position the racer finishes the race, the more points that racer will earn. (1st place = 5pts., 2nd = 4pts., etc...) Players have to earn a certain number of points in a series of races, in order to move on to tougher competition. If the player becomes really proficient, they'll then be able to challenge Jeremy McGrath himself for the championship.

Getting far in this mode will also unlock more bikes. The various motorcycles available have different statistics in engine power, tire grip, and handling. Players can choose to race with either auto or manual transmission.

The Single Racing mode lets the player race alone or with opponents or against another player. Players get to select from 7 different tracks and can also race on reversed versions of those tracks. Ghost Racing let's the player compete against a ghost racer who represents the player's best time on a track.

The game also includes a track editor. Players can place various jumps, hairpin turns, and other types of track features and create their own track to race on.</desc>

		<desc>Jersey Devil, as the title implies, is loosely based upon the legendary New Jersey beast of the same name. Instead of the horrific beast the legend describes, the protagonist of the title is cute purple creature with long-ears and small wings. Dr. Knarf -- the villain of the piece -- has created a legion of mutated vegetables to do his evil bidding, and it falls to Jersey Devil to stop the maniacal scientist.

To do this, the purple protagonist must venture through a series of 3D platform stages spread across themed environments such as a museum, cemetery, forest, and even a haunted house. Endowed with an ample set of abilities, Jersey Devil must jump, glide, and tail whip his way through the hordes of vegetables and undead minions, the latter comprising such mainstays as zombies, bats, and spiders.</desc>

		<desc>Developed by SingleTrac, Jet Moto blends futuristic motocross racing with hazard ridden tracks. Rather than using traditional cars or motorcycles, these vehicles are a cross between jet skis and hovercrafts. With turbo-charged engines, these bikes can tread water, perform dangerous aerial flips and catch serious air. There are 20 vehicles/characters in all, each with varying acceleration times, weight, suspension (lift) and handling capabilities.
 While there's only a handful of tracks readily available, there are nine in all -- the latter courses will be unlocked by doing well in tournaments. Spanning the globe, tracks are set throughout snowy mountains and ice, massive cliffs, murky swamps and vibrant beaches. Located throughout each course are magnetic pillars in which you can grapple and handle turns in a more sufficient manner.</desc>

		<desc>The third entry in the Jet Moto series once again places you in the driving seat of a futuristic hoverbike, racing at breakneck speed in a truly extreme sport. While a Jet Moto hoverbike might look like a jet ski, it is capable of far more: it travels across land as well as water and can use a magnetic grapple to make extremely tight turns. During a race, drivers must skillfully time jumps, dodge obstacles, and contend with some feisty opponents who won't hesitate to bump you into a tree or maybe even knock you off a cliff.

Jet Moto 3 offers ten different riders and 19 tracks across the wide open ocean, over mountainous terrain, and through cityscapes. As with the earlier games, two people can still race in a split-screen mode.</desc>

Utilizing a small hand-shaped cursor, players construct puzzles that range in size from 24 to 96 to 150 pieces, each depicting anything from animals and insects to sports and anim? characters. Players are given only seven pieces at a time with which to work, and basic statistics such as the number of pieces placed both, correctly and incorrectly, as well as the time elapsed is continually displayed.
 The multiplayer portion of the title allows up to four players to compete against one another, in a race to see who can complete the puzzle fastest. A handful of options are available, including whether or not an outline of the various shapes is displayed on the playing field, thereby making the game easier.</desc>

El Diablo, the Lord of the Underworld, sees this and being incapable of creating his own music, steals Johnny's guitar Anita and has his demons kidnap great musical legends from around the planet.
 Johnny manages to avoid the goon squads and follows them back to the underworld. There, armed with a bazooka-guitar, he is ready to wreak havoc on the bad guys in an attempt to rescue his true love, Anita.
 This cartoon-style game is set in the year 2050 A.D. and features various special effects and scenery commensurate with the hellish Underworld setting. Movement includes 360-degree spin jumps, hover jumps and other standard 3D scrolling action.
 As you play, not only can you shoot unlimited blasts from your guitar gun but you can power it up to release a powerful sonic blast that will fry anything within hearing range. In Johnny Bazookatone, you'll use ordinary and super-weapons, get power-ups and search for secret passages that lead to bonus levels. The CD also contains some bonus music tracks.</desc>

Now PlayStation gamers will be able to take a Stand and wallop their friends over the head with them in the comfort of their own home.
 This game offers much of the two dimensional fighting fare that Capcom is renowned for. It takes a side venture into new realms with the addition of your Stand partners however. When you whip out a special attack or some hits, a phantasmal apparition will appear to give you back up. Each one differs depending on the characters alignment along the Tarot spectrum, and players also have the ability to put their Stand into a more active role once they build up their Stand Gauge. Then your alter egos can weigh in and have the ability to set up painful chain combos and they enable special character abilities like double jumping and air attacks.</desc>

		<desc>Trouble in Mega-City One: An unidentified perpetrator has taken hostages, including the mayor. Attempts to apprehend him have already lead to the loss of 17 Judges. He states that only one man is allowed to come near: Judge Dredd. There's obviously some history between them. It's time for the toughest lawman of them all to move in and dispense justice via his Lawgiver gun.

Judge Dredd for the PlayStation is an 'on rails' lightgun shooter based on the original comics instead of the 1995 movie. The action moves through pre-rendered environments on a fixed path. 14 levels spread over 4 stages must be cleared of lawbreakers. 

Most enemies are polygonal 3D models overlaid over the video backdrop, but the background can also be shot at: gun turrets and some bosses like hovertanks and other heavy machinery are pre-rendered objects. Powerups are hidden in the scenery as well: there are different ammunition types for the Lawgiver, including rapid fire and heat-seekers. Also available are medikits, extra lives and rockets which can clear the screen of enemies.

Not everything on the screen should be shot at, however: sometimes, innocent citizens will cross the scene. Hitting too many of them means a quick 'game over'.

The storyline of the game is told between levels via live-action cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Juggernaut is a slow-paced, point-and-click adventure in the same vein as the PC title Myst. It tells the story of a young woman named Sarah who, after having received an antique bottle as a gift from her boyfriend, opens it only to be consumed by an enigmatic, evil force. Having inadvertently caused her plight, players assume the role of her boyfriend who, aided by a priest, must venture into her mind, defeat the being that now resides there, and ultimately, save her soul.
 The gist of the gameplay consists of moving about a series of static screens, collecting items and objects for later use, and solving puzzles in order to progress further into the game. An onscreen compass allows players to determine in which cardinal direction they're able to proceed. Movement between these screens is facilitated by pressing the appropriate direction on the D-pad. If the scene contains any interactive elements, a cursor is displayed that can be moved about the environment, allowing players to investigate or manipulate whatever they are.
 Exploring the recesses of Sarah's mind, players find themselves confronted with a variety of surreal, often disturbing images. The puzzles, too, are out of the ordinary, requiring players to find a corporeal entity for their spiritual essence so they may interact with objects; utilizing color and music to solve puzzles and the like. The title presents a host of puzzles that range in difficulty and scope, some requiring the use of acquired implements, while others demand logic.
 The most important item in your possession is the pendant from your girlfriend.You can use this at any time to save your game.
 Features:
 * Save your girlfriend Sarah from the Great Evil that possesses her
 * Acquire items that may be used to aid you in your quest
 * Solve an array of puzzles to advance further into the title</desc>

		<desc>What would the video game industry be without mad, evil scientists such as Baron Aloha that want to take over the world? We'd have fewer games, that's for sure! Anyway, if this guy carries out his plans, the whole universe will suffer under his menacing wrath. Fortunately, help is on the way. Yes, a giant mechanical rabbit, aptly named Robbit, is here to save the day. And of course, you are Robbit and must go around the world of Jumping Flash! collecting the missing "jetpods" and stop Baron Aloha.
 Jumping Flash! is a first person shooter set in a graphically stunning 3D universe. To stop Aloha, you must tackle and hop (well, you ARE a big mechanical bunny) your way through 6 worlds divided into 18 different levels, pick up various special weapons, blast little critters that try to get in your way and find the missing jetpods.</desc>

		<desc>After being defeated by the good-natured Robbit, the diabolical Baron Aloha has retreated to his private island, Little Muu. Along with his army of MuuMuu creatures, he figured he was finally safe from his arch-nemesis. He figured wrong...
 One day, Baron was visited by the planet-sized monster known as Kaptain Kabuki. This behemoth roams the galaxies and bottles up planets for his collection; kind of like ships-in-a-bottle. Baron may be an evil bad guy with a chemical imbalance, but he is no fool! He quickly got the heck out of dodge and made an ironic call for help; he called Robbit!</desc>

		<desc>K-1 Grand Prix (Fighting Illusion K-1 Grand Prix '98 in Japan) is a kickboxing game featuring 32 real K-1 fighters.
 The game features a 1 player K-1 Kings mode, where the player picks a fighter and faces off against a series of computer controlled fighters, and another mode which is the 2 player K-1 Hercules mode. There is also the K-1 Grand Prix mode which has 16 fighters competing in a tournament to be the K-1 champion.
 The K-1 Challenge lets the player create a fighter. Players get to choose their fighters build type, skin color, color of their trunks, nationality, and a gym to train at which best reflects the fighting style they want. Players get to choose a trainer and 2 sub trainers to help condition them to become a fighting machine. To condition, the player selects a variety of exercises like jumping rope or using a medicine ball for their fighter to train in. Training builds up the fighters statistics and also earns them training points which can then be spent on moves such as uppercuts and hooks. Eventually after training for a while, the player will be challenged by a rival and they can choose to accept the challenge or decline if they feel they aren't ready yet and need more training. This mode takes the player's fighter through 8 years of his career trying to become a K-1 champion.</desc>

		<desc>Enter a world where humans and creatures called Timenoids coexist. These blue-skinned Timenoids are determined to wipe out the inferior human race, and this is where you come in. You play the role of Millennia, a young woman who was brainwashed at an early age to do the Timenoids' bidding. She now believes that the humans must be exterminated from the world, which is rather ironic, since she is human herself. Yet if she succeeds, the Timenoids have promised her immortality and the power to become one of their own...
 In this sequel to Tecmo's Deception, you are once again placed inside a castle to lure invaders into various traps. The game differs from the original in several ways, however. The view is no longer first-person, so you can see your character at all times. Multiple traps can also be triggered at once (up to three), forming even deadlier combinations than the original. In addition, the vibration mode is supported on the Dual Shock Analog Controller to provide feedback on each gruesome death. Prepare for a non-linear journey as the decisions you make during the game affect the type of ending you'll receive. Maybe, just maybe, you'll remember your past...</desc>

		<desc>A turn-based, strategy RPG, Kartia presents players with two disparate, yet intersecting storylines: one as the shrine warrior, Lacryma Christi; the other as Toxa Classico, an arrogant knight. Having selected a character, players embark on a journey spanning 18 chapters, each of which is preceded by pertinent dialogue and FMV scenes, the former accompanied by character portraits from Yoshitaka Amano (best known for his work on the Final Fantasy series). The titular Kartia represents the lifeblood of the world of Rebus, as it is from this that almost anything can be created. Prior to and during each skirmish, Kartia can be used to fashion spells, equipment, and phantoms by assembling the various elements each entity requires.</desc>

		<desc>Players choose one of 14 martial arts experts to lead to ultimate victory in this 3D fighting game from A1. Players can customize such details as fighting style, toughness, and even glove weight to find a fighter who matches their preferences. Guide your kickboxer from a rookie beginner to a contender for the heavyweight title. A two-player mode allows rivals to face-off in head-to-head bouts.
 At the onset of the game, only four of these fighters are available, but by beating opponents in the game's somewhat cheesy Story mode, gamers will eventually have 14 fighters to choose from. After completing the daunting task that is Story mode, players will have an even better time competing in the game's primary Ranking mode. Here they must fight anywhere between three and 12 fighters to win the title belt and gain valuable experience points. After winning a title, they can then defend their title to gain more points or open up new championship tournaments. While there are no rewarding endings or additional special characters to be earned, Ranking Mode is enjoyable enough to bring players back again and again.</desc>

		<desc>The King of Fighters, officially abbreviated KOF, is a series of fighting games by SNK Playmore, formerly SNK. The series was originally developed for SNK's Neo-Geo MVS arcade hardware, which served as the main platform for the series until 2004, when SNK retired the MVS in favor of the Atomiswave arcade board and will move the series to the Taito Type X2 with the release of The King of Fighters XII. Ports of the arcade games and original The King of Fighters games have been released for the Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket, Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, N-Gage, Sega Saturn and Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation and PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox. One of the most recent games in the series are KOF: Maximum Impact series.
 The initial storyline follows Kyo Kusanagi, a young Japanese who enters The King of Fighters tournaments. Being the heir of the ancient Kusanagi clan, who wield pyrokinetic powers, Kyo manages to use its powerful techniques to become champion of the tournament along with his friends. Kyo and his friends find themsleves meeting the host of the events: a powerful criminal named Rugal Bernstein, who wants to find worthy opponents to kill so that he can turn them into statues in order to remember his ruthless victories but is defeated. In the 1995 KOF tournament, it is revealed the entity of Orochi: an ancient eight-headed demon who was sealed by the three ancient artifacts of Japan. Rugal tries to use it but dies in the process. In this game, a fighter named Iori Yagami appears aiming to kill Kyo and destroy the Kusanagi clan, as revenge for the Yagami clan.
 The King of Fighters '95 is a 1995 fighting game produced by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home console. It is the sequel to The King of Fighters '94 and the second game in The King of Fighters series. It is also the first game in the series to be ported to other home consoles besides the Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD, with versions released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn and Game Boy.
 The King of Fighters '95 marks the beginning of a story arc that later became known as the "Orochi Saga". However, the only elements from the Orochi saga known in this game are the introduction of Kyo's rival, Iori Yagami, and Rugal's use of the Orochi power.
 Rugal Bernstein, thought to have perished in an explosion in the previous game, had in fact survived and sent out invitations to the teams from the previous game signed simply 'R'. Only one of the previous teams failed to attend the new tournament, the American S</desc>

		<desc>The King of Fighters '99: Millennium Battle is a 1999 head-to-head fighting game by SNK released for the Neo Geo arcade and home platform. It is the sixth installment in the company's The King of Fighters series. The game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD and the PlayStation as the final KOF game released for both platforms. A Dreamcast version was also released under the title The King of Fighters '99 Evolution in which the stages look exactly the same as compared with the arcade counterpart only to be exclusively, remodeled into 3D rendered. Both the Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are included in The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. The game introduces several changes to the established KOF format, as well as a new story arc that would later be dubbed the "NESTS Chronicles".
 PLOT:
 Two years have passed since the last King of Fighters tournament and nobody has seen Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami since they defeated Orochi at the climax of the 1997 tournament, but out of the blue, new invitations are sent out to many characters, inviting them to a brand new tournament, though this competition is more of a secretive affair than the ones in '96 and '97. Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss.
 PLAYSTATION VERSION:
 The 1999 edition of the The King of Fighters series made the rounds from the arcade to the Neo Geo and Dreamcast before finding its way to the PlayStation console with this release. Players choose a team of three warriors and take on all challengers in this classically styled 2D fighter from the veterans at Agetec and SNK.
 Though based heavily on earlier versions of The King of Fighters '99, this PlayStation game adds new features designed to especially appeal to fans of the series, such as voice and picture galleries and a color edit mode that allows players to change the appearance of their favorite characters.
 Features:
 The King of Fighters '99 adds one new character to the roster of 32
 New to the series are Striker Matches where characters jump into matches to save teammates
 Gallery mode features a variety of artwork, demo animations and voice samples</desc>

		<desc>Ace, Gene, Paul and Peter rock and roll your PlayStation with KISS Pinball. Decorated by the familiar makeup-enhanced, cartoon-like mugs of the "hottest band in the world," the game features two tables: "Last Stop Oblivion" and "Netherworld." Four game modes are available: Novice, Regular, Arcade and Tournament.
 The storyline for KISS Pinball revolves around the band battling the Dark Lord and claiming the "Kissneth" as their own. Your objectives include getting past security to snag an autograph, lighting "PASS" to access backstage, collecting weapons, shooting a spinner to upgrade record sales, hitting the Statue of Liberty repeatedly to reveal the Destroyer Skull to start 3-ball, spelling "MAYHEM" to light video mode, collecting lost souls, discovering hidden power-ups, locking balls with Gene's tongue and much more.
 Your perspective is directly above each table. You can see approximately one-third of the playfield at a time with the screen scrolling to follow the course of the ball. Each table has the standard two-flipper layout, with the ability to nudge the table up, left, and right to influence ball movement. But be careful not to "tilt" the machine!</desc>

		<desc>Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a side-scrolling platform game viewed from a "2.5D" perspective. The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a two-dimensional fashion, but the game is rendered in three dimensions. This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path. The game is divided into levels called "Visions", where the player progresses by following a path with defeatable computer-controlled enemies and puzzles that must be solved. At the end of some levels, the player must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy.

 As time went by, Nementon Abbey was turned into a prison and it's inhabitants were confined to suffer and die. This practice continued for many years until the facility was purchased by Patrick Heyworth, a wealthy criminal who turned the once peaceful monastery into a refuge for vagrants and law-breakers. After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.

After Heyworth took control over the building, rumors of horror and great riches echoed throughout the world; the rumors lured many thieves, none of which returned to their homes.

		<desc>In the early 21st century, the Earth is under attack by aliens. In five areas of the planet, they have erected energy generators, creating a field that slowly encompasses the entire planet surface. They have also taken hundreds of humans prisoner. Someone has to stop them. Enter Russian Commander Ivan Popovich, nicknamed "Krazy Ivan". He is a paranoid schizophrenic, prone to burst out into violence at any time. In other words, he's perfect for the job.

The player controls Ivan's "Steel Cossack" power suit on the three-dimensional battlefields. In each of the five areas in the game, two kinds of enemies can be found: Drones and Sentients. Drones are smaller air and ground vehicles that often respawn. Sentients are mechs similar in size and capability to the Steel Cossack. Each of the Sentients must be eliminated before the energy field generator can be destroyed to complete the mission.

The Cossack is capable of carrying lots of weapons: projectile and energy guns, unguided and guided missiles, and other special weapons. Destroyed enemies reveal captured humans, to be rescued by Ivan, and power-ups, which recharge shields or rearm weapons.

After a successful mission, Ivan can upgrade the Cossack with more powerful weapons and replace the mech's armor.

Between the missions, rather humorous live-action cutscenes (starring English actors sporting thick Russian accents) continue the story.</desc>

		<desc>Featuring characters from the animated film series, The Land Before Time: Big Water Adventure lets young players guide Littlefoot, Ducky, Cera, and Spike through 14 levels in four worlds: Mountain Pass, Great Landbreak, New Water, and Soggy Swamp. Characters jump, run, slide, head-butt, and tail-whip as they explore levels containing obstacles such as moving logs, trees, lava, geysers, rivers, and ravines. The objective in each level is to collect 30 "treestars" and unlock bonus picture puzzles in Petrie's Palace.
			Other features include in-game movies and Mo's Big Water Racing, a bonus game that becomes available only after the main game has been completed with all four characters. In the bonus game, players have Mo jump through hoops on the river to trigger special animations. Each stage in the main game unlocks the next in sequential order, but once completed, levels can be replayed in any order in an attempt to collect all possible treestars.</desc>

		<desc>Largo Winch, the "billionaire in blue jeans," is based on the character created by novelist Jean van Hamme, now popular in France in the form of comic strips and a television series. Much like Lara Croft and James Bond, the rich, sophisticated, tough, agile, and cunning Winch is thrust into situations that only a top commando could handle. In Largo Winch.// Commando SAR, players guide Largo on a quest to track down terrorists, who are threatening his financial empire, and rescue a young journalist, Tania Kournakova, who was kidnapped from his Venezuelan chemical factory.
 Members of the South American Redemption (SAR) have been blackmailed by a rival corporation and forced to commit acts against Largo's empire by the evil Mrs. Fritz. Now, Winch must use his fists, a pistol, and semi-retrievable (only if they miss the target) throwing knives in conjunction with gadgets like a brainwave scanner for locating enemies, a radio (for hints and messages from friends), and his toolkit. His arsenal, combined with stealthy movement, helps the jet-set commando put an end to the conspiracy facing him in his first PlayStation adventure.</desc>

		<desc>1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss.  There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls...

Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.  Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon.

The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certa</desc>

		<desc>Ten thousand years ago the Legend was born. The Divine Tree's mystical powers were said to have given birth to all life. The 105th race born of the Tree was the mighty Dragons. The 106th was the human race and the 107th was the Winglies. Peace and tranquility reigned throughout the land, but suddenly a violent uprising occurred, led by the Winglies, who enslaved humanity. To counter this, the humans acquired the Dragons' spiritual forces and defeated their nemeses, which led to eventual harmony between all. However, the prophecy has only begun as the past and future are about to collide...
 In Sony's role-playing game, The Legend of Dragoon for the PlayStation, you'll travel across the land searching for clues and discovering new enemies as well as friends you can add to your party. Up to three members per party can fight at once, in an interface that Final Fantasy fans may find familiar, the difference being that you can become a Dragoon with supernatural powers taken from the souls of Dragons. Animals will attack you from nowhere while other creatures and even human opponents will specifically seek and destroy.
 Each warrior has his or her own weapons and magic, with the ability to retreat a fight based on chance. Experience points will add up and each member of the party will gain a level as their hit points increase. The combat technique known as Dragoon Additions -- shown as SP (Spirit Power) -- measures a Dragoon's ability to fight. When your character approaches an enemy upon initiating an attack, a rectangular grid targets the enemy before your weapon is swung. If you press it in time for the outer rectangle to close in, matching the center rectangle, you'll be able to hit your target and continue to get in several more hits depending on how fast and accurate you are executing the button sequence.
 Magical attacks draw their power from the Elements such as water, fire, wind, earth, darkness and light, thunder, and non-elemental. Using the opposite of an enemy's element will inflict the most damage. The game also consists of another unique fighting technique that is more commonly used: the Multi-Attack. It allows one to inflict more damage than normal. When it is used, the X button appears onscreen and you must rapidly tap the X button to increase the power of the attack to over 100 percent. If you do nothing, you will only inflict a small amount of damage. There is also the interactive counterattack which, if not properly done, will cut off the res</desc>

		<desc>After creating a massive world with vast oceans, landscapes and an infinite universe, God instituted human beings to keep his creation in order. Upon realization that man was mortally flawed with weaknesses and feelings, he created a mysterious force known as the Seru; these stone objects would aid humans in decisions and day to day functions. Worn as an apparel item, they granted the wearer many strengths and abilities ranging from the movement of heavy objects to flying capabilities. Thus, human life was made easier -- the Seru would forever obey their masters.
 And then the Mist arrived.
 Filled with destructive means and hatred, the Mist covered the human's cultivated lands and destroyed a seemingly eternal bond with the Seru. Instead of loyally helping their masters, the mysterious stones turned against the humans; they became maniacal tools of evil, controlling minds and ruining innocent lives. The human existence was reduced tremendously with few survivors fleeing to uncharted territories. Perhaps the Mist wouldn't find them wherever they ran.</desc>

		<desc>A twinkling consciousness became a star that sparkled in the night and banished the darkness. The Mana Goddess acquired consciousness by gazing into the light of that sun. She made Fa´Diel, a great land, but so far an empty one.

In Legend of Mana you control a hero or heroine traveling over the land of Fa’Diel. The game features a land creation system, allowing you to create new locations and story elements by placing mysterious artifacts. Those ancient artifacts are repositories of the land´s long-forgotten memories and the many events that once took place there. As the game advances, you will receive more artifacts and find out more about the land. At home you can raise pet monsters and create powerful golems, forge mighty weapons or refine musical instruments. On your adventures you can meet various interesting characters and fight against gruesome monsters.

The game is extremely non-linear in terms of gameplay. You can explore areas in any order and play through 67 related scenarios. Eventually you will resurrect the Mana Tree and discover the Legend of Mana.</desc>

		<desc>As a follow-up to the first LEGO Island PC title, LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge features Pepper Roni, a pizza delivery boy that players control, trying to save LEGO Island from the evil Brickster. The Brickster has dismantled the Infomaniac's building instruction book, known as the Constructopedia, and only Pepper can find the pages. Meanwhile, as if The Brickster and the havoc he wreaks aren't bad enough, Pepper has to keep his day job delivering pizzas.
			While exploring LEGO Island, clues and information must be obtained from the inhabitants. Playing as Pepper, gamers skateboard, walk, or otherwise transport themselves around the island, talking to people, solving puzzles, and playing a variety of sub-games. Bull fighting, jousting, driving, and flying are just some of the activities included in the sub-games. After winning enough mini-games and successfully navigating all areas, Pepper will be faced with the challenge to defeat The Brickster in one last game. If Pepper can avoid the falling bricks while clearing a path to The Brickster, he can throw pizzas that will splat the villain into submission.
			Other features and areas of the game include an inventory screen, Pepper's house (built with bricks he acquires during play), and additional pickup items for later use. Constructopedia pages must be collected in their entirety; gems and goblets increase scores, and medals can be earned based upon performances in sub-games.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the underground Lego universe, you must take control of a team of lego men and build your way through mission based levels, ranging from saving lost crew members, finding hidden bases destroyed in the rubble and building your base to gain new vehicles. As your crew grow in confidence, they learn new abilities like piloting skills or become explosive experts. All the lego pieces from the rock raiders series are there to choose from when building your base, and the lego men move just like the real thing (just without the hands pushing them along).</desc>

		<desc>The storyline in Lemmings 3D appears unrelated to previous Lemmings games, presumably because the story in All New World of Lemmings never got completed, and because the previous developer, DMA Design, was no longer involved in the series. Instead, there is an introduction movie showing a completely flat (2D) lemming popping out of a computer's floppy drive, and finding a "3D" button to press, which makes him 3-dimensional. After that, the PC blows up and the (now 3D) lemmings inside it escape.</desc>

		<desc>Set against the backdrop of an inter-galactic penal colony, Loaded sees players, as one of six psychotic inmates, attempting to navigate fifteen enemy-laden levels en route to their ultimate goal; the killing of the sadistic warden -- known as FUB (Fat Ugly Boy) -- of said penal colony. The characters, with names such as Butch, FWANK, Cap N Hands, Mamma, Bounca, and Vox run the gamut from cross-dressing freaks and cyborg pirates to demented clowns and female cyber-criminals. All are rated in a handful of categories; each possessing differing speed, vitality and damage potential attributes. Armed with their character's weapon of choice, up to two players can blast their way through stages populated by fellow inmates, guards, straight-jacket laden mental patients, rats, and more. While objectives are present, the basic formula amounts to scouring each level in search of color-coded keys that will allow you to advance further into the level, while blasting hostiles and collecting ammunition and health power-ups to replenish your reserves. A small on-screen map allows you to find your way through the maze-like stages.</desc>

		<desc>Looney Tunes Racing is a kart-racing game for the PlayStation. There are some definite similarities between this title and Crash Team Racing, both in game play mechanics and depth. Completely immersed in the humor and soul of the Looney Tunes license, the player starts the game with only a handful of characters and levels available, but as the game proceeds features become unlocked including new characters, levels, and challenges.

Each character has an unique vehicle themed just for them, and is accompanied by voice taunts, provided by Warner Bros. licensed voice actors, and character-specific animations that help bring these characters to life.

The weapons the player can unleash onto the opponents include cherry bombs, homing cream pies, thunder clouds with devastating lightning bolts, and giant anvils that drop out of the sky. In addition, each uniquely themed level has a series of amusing booby traps and obstacles that the player can unleash to slow down your foes. The player can make boulders fall, launch giant boxing gloves on springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get spacecraft to fire lasers in the Martian level, and activate a huge, fat, white horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies. Even Gossamer, the large monster make entirely of red hair (except for those big white eyes and white tennis shoes), makes a cameo in the Gossamer’s castle level, as he comes right out onto the track to take out any oncoming traffic.

Beyond the races, other noteworthy game modes include the Multi-player Battle Mode, where the players basically pummel each other with wacky weaponry, and the ACME Challenges, which include challenges such as Boss Races (against Porky Pig, for example), picking up key items in a certain order, and others.</desc>

Developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts, The Lost World: Jurassic Park is based on both the novel by Michael Crichton and Steven Spielbergâ€™s film The Lost World: Jurassic Park. A year later a special edition of the game was released for the Sony PlayStation as a part of their Greatest Hits line-up and featured several modifications to the game play.

The player takes control of characters struggling to survive on INGenâ€™s â€œSite Bâ€ populated by over 20 species of dinosaurs in an environment of escalating chaos. There are 5 characters in all to choose from, each with their own special abilities and attributes. While the game is in 3D, the game play resembles early 2D platformers in which you generically either go left or right, limiting the mobility of each character.</desc>

		<desc>You, as Lucky Luke, have to stop the Dalton gang from making another crime. Walking around town you have to solve puzzles, shoot criminals and collect money. After finishing the level you have a chance to buy an extra life with the money collected. Shooting isn't ordinary, often Lucky needs to ricochet shots to hit his target. The game view sometimes changes from 2D style to behind the shoulders. The levels differ from town exploring, to bottle-shooting in a bar, to freeing hostages on the roof of train, to Indian sneaking. But, all of them lead Lucky to $1,000,000 for the capture of the Daltons.</desc>

The player controls Kimberly Stride, who is a scientist.
She has to save the world from bad DNA that is slowly "eating" everything away.

As a player, you control this hovercraft-thingy which was designed to be a safe vehicle to be in while travelling through this infested world. The game has nice 3D graphics and a very unique mood to it that separates it from the more common shooters.</desc>

		<desc>At the end of the 20th century, the planet Mars was the subject of numerous tests. Scientists believed human life could exist on the planet, which was great news to everyone because the Earth was slowly running out of natural resources. If it was ever needed, the government could set up shop on the surface of Mars and transport humans to live in colonies or bring back valuable resources to Earth.
 By the year 2034, Earth has finally run out of resources and machines have been set to Mars in an attempt to mine it. The machines were given synthetic brains with simple artificial intelligence and without any defensive mechanisms or assault weaponry. This proved to be very costly to the human race, since aliens have landed on the planet and are taking over the robots.</desc>

		<desc>Madden NFL 2001 is the fifth game in Electronic Arts' football dynasty on the PlayStation. In terms of visual presentation, Madden 2001 uses the same 3D engine as found in its predecessor. The character and crowd graphics are made up of textured polygons, with the usual details found in the series such as recognizable names, numbers, and authentic uniforms.
 The animation of the player movement includes an array of jukes, dives, tucks, rolls, and hits. You'll also be able to recognize your favorite stadium, as each is modeled after the real-life arena thanks to an official NFL license. Finally, the game offers little extras such as weather effects, helmet shine and controllable endzone celebrations.</desc>

		<desc>The "2005" edition of the best-selling Madden NFL sports game series hits the field with another new season's worth of refinements and additions. Attention has been paid to the defensive game in this version, with enhancements intended to give gamers more options and more control when they're playing from the other side of the football. Many of this year's new features involve the NFL players themselves, however, calling upon gamers to maintain and develop their star athletes. Players are now rewarded for their good performances throughout the season, and individuals can be affected by the ebb and flow of morale.
 Madden 2005 offers "hit stick," control, which allows the right analog stick to be used to perform the kind of huge, momentum-shifting hits that fans will hear way up in the nosebleed section. Risks are involved, however, and players who miss tackles under the hit stick system's less rigid controls have only themselves to blame. Gamers can also involve themselves more deeply in defensive strategy than they could in earlier versions of Madden NFL. The new Defensive Playmaker Control system allows them to modify assignments for any player on the field, to set up blitzes, jams, and individual man-to-man coverage, right up until the moment the ball is snapped.</desc>

		<desc>Madden Football has always been known as the pioneer of football games. Madden NFL 98 is as real as it gets to actually being a part of the NFL. Madden NFL 98 includes all licensed NFL teams and even has historical teams like the 1983 Raiders and 1985 Bears, and not to mention the All-Madden teams. It has all the NFL stadiums, the most current rosters, and every stat possible.
 The game modes include, Exhibition, Season, Custom Season, Tournament, Fantasy Draft, and Front Office. As for sound, 98 offers an interactive crowd plus the real voices of Pat Summeral and John Madden's crazy quotes called Maddenisms. The best part of all is the realistic gameplay and motion of the players. Virtually every move is possible. From spins to stiff arms. It's all there!

		<desc>For the first time on the PlayStation, Madden NFL 99 sports a 3D polygon engine to go along with new motion-captured NFL animations. Multiple wrap tackles, shoulder drags, pump-fakes, sideline grabs and touchdown celebrations are just a few of the moves at your disposal.
 If this seems daunting, a One-Button Mode is available to make things less complicated for novice users. An Arcade Mode will also help new players get a feel for the game, which does away with the rules to allow for greater action and more devastating hits. The game includes actual NFL players with ratings based on the 1997 season, all the professional teams, as well as team-specific NFL playbooks.
 Franchise, Season, Practice, Exhibition, Playoffs and Fantasy Draft are the six different game modes in Madden NFL 99, with Franchise Mode making its first appearance. This mode offers a single player the experience of playing and managing a team for multiple seasons, which involves negotiating the salary cap, signing free-agents and even replacing retired players!
 An EA Sports game would not be complete without detailed statistical tracking, and Madden NFL 99 is no different. Individual statistics, league leaders, team statistics as well as season standings can all be saved to a memory card. If you have a Multi Tap adapter, up to eight players can compete on the same screen with John Madden and Pat Summerall commenting on the action from the booth.
 Features:
 New Franchise Mode lets you draft, trade, sign, and release players
 Over 120 NFL teams and NFL rosters
 Includes bonus Madden 101 disc featuring NFL Films footage</desc>

		<desc>Magic: The Gathering - Battlemage is the real-time adaptation of the popular Magic collectible card game. The player assumes the role of a planeswalker, a powerful magician in the world of Dominaria, the world containing the most magical energy in Magic's universe of Dominia.
 The goal of the player is to defeat one opposing planeswalker in the Duel mode of the game, or to wage a campaign against all five of his rivals on a thirty-territory map comprising the continent of Corondor. To achieve victory, the player must cast spells against his opponent, which take the form of creatures and energy that will attack the player's adversary. At the same time, the player's rival is also casting spells, in an effort to destroy the player's planeswalker.
 The spells at the player's disposal are drawn from the Magic collectible card game, from their 4th edition and Mirage sets. These spells are depicted by icons intended to "represent" each spell, which must be identified in order that the player cast the spell intended.</desc>

		<desc>Magic Carpet is a conversion of a classic PC game that was also released for the Saturn console.
			Magic Carpet is a very original title. Flying on a carpet itself is original in video games,but the concept and story line make this one of a kind.
			Collect magical powers by shooting the balls (mana) floating around the world and make them your color (white). Then, let your hot air balloons pick them up and bring them to your castle before the other wizards get to your mana and change it to their own color. That's the main thing of the game.
			All of the 13 different beasts that fly or walk around in each of the worlds contain a certain amount of mana, and when destroyed, it's released. You complete a world (there's about 75 of them!) when a certain amount of mana has been stored in your castle.
			A really interesting aspect of mana is that you can access more spells the more you get,there are 20 different spells that can be found in the game.</desc>

		<desc>"Marbles with Attitude" await gamers looking for logic, puzzle, and action-based gameplay in Elo Interactive's Marble Master. Players can play solo in four modes at three levels of difficulty in sudden death, mission, competition, or arcade, with the latter two modes available for two-player action. Gameplay features two types of marbles: normal and "extras." The former are numbered to show the marbles' weight, while the latter are weightless animated marbles that perform special functions during the game.
 Marble Master provides more than 25 variations of marbles (e.g., crushers, bombs, jokers), each with a special power. Extras become steadily available as higher levels are attained, with the most powerful Flash Triangle marble (changes all marbles in a triangle to the same type) appearing at level 36. A special set of marbles is available exclusively for the arcade mode. See-saws, cranes, trios, combinations, closed circles, and more offer a myriad of gameplay styles, with options ranging from selection of various sets of marbles to screen and color effects.</desc>

		<desc>The events begin in 11,000 BC when a meteorite from Mars strikes the Antarctic ice. It isn't until 1984 that it is discovered by mankind and labeled ALH 84001. A dozen years later, NASA's analysis is complete and the existence of alien microfossils confirmed. In 2009, a manned mission to Mars to investigate bacterial life is launched with the establishment of the Vita 1 base the result.
 And now, in 2018, all communication with the base has been terminated. Vita 1's last message is the enigmatic: "If you send a manned craft, warn the crew to stay alone, stay alive." Nearly a year later, a team sent to investigate survives a crash on the Martian surface and arrives at the derelict base. Following the advice of the last message from Vita 1, each member enters the base through a separate airlock.</desc>

		<desc>Marvel Super Heroes is a 2D fighting game and the second Capcom title to feature characters from the Marvel comic universe. The gameplay is very similar to X-Men: Children of the Atom, but with a simplified Super Combo gauge and the addition of infinity gems. Each character starts with a set of gems. These can be activated during a fight to improve speed, power and defence, or provide special abilities to create crushing stone walls, open up a rift in space, or reverse the opponent's controls. The use of the gems is inspired by the The Infinity Gauntlet comic book series.</desc>

The off-screen one also regains some health while waiting. Both opposing characters need to be defeated to win the match, and when one dies the other is called in automatically. The tag team options introduces Variable Attack, Variable Counter and Variable Combination where the two characters team up to attack, counter of perform a special move.</desc>

In contrast to X-Men vs. Street Fighter and Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, the game features characters from numerous Capcom franchises such as Mega Man and Strider, rather than just Street Fighter characters. The game takes place within the Marvel comic continuity, as Professor Charles Xavier calls out for heroes to stop him before he merges with the consciousness of Magneto and becomes the being known as Onslaught, the final boss. The game was developed in late 1997 and first released in January 1998.</desc>

Each tank has different armor and speed statistics: the Cheetah is a speedy tank built for hit and run operations; the Cobra lacks maneuverability but has highly destructive capabilities; and the Viper is an able firehouse without the armor capabilities of the Cobra.
 Regardless of which tank you've chosen, they all begin with a 100mm Cannon and a chain gun. Among the various weapons you'll encounter are hi-explosive shells that explode on contact, mines, mortars, Torus Bombs that surround the tank with an explosion ring, flamethrowers and guided missiles.</desc>

		<desc>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game developed by System Soft.

Gameplay engages players by permitting them to summon and move monsters around a board in an effort to capture towers and to eventually defeat the opponents (which are controlled either by other humans or by the computer program). Moves are based on a hexagonal board structure, such that every tile on the board is adjacent to six other tiles. Other notable features were the large variety of monsters, upgrading ("leveling up") of veteran units and control of a "Master" character who, if killed, can end the game for that player.

The focus of the game is strategic, despite the fantasy-type characters that might imply an RPG element. Other than the existence of the Master character and magic in the game, the gameplay is very similar to System Soft's more hardcore modern warfare strategic wargame series Daisenryaku, with the exception that some versions of the Master of Monsters (such as Master of Monsters ? Final) series allow equippable items, weapons and armor.</desc>

		<desc>Maximum Force is a lightgun game for one or two players. As top counter-terrorism agents, you and a partner have three missions to complete to eradicate the world of a band of evil terrorists.
 Each mission set in radically different locations and is divided into three stages. After each stage you and your partner are rated in terms of accuracy, number of kills, number of streaks (consecutive hits), total shots fired, amount of damage done, and your total score. The third mission can be played only when the first two have been completed.
 Per standard shooting games, you must try to kill the terrorists and spare the innocents. There are power-ups to shoot that will increase your firepower to shotgun or machine gun level.
 Not standard to many shooting games however is the encouragement the Maximum Force presents to do physical damage to your surroundings. Most everything in the game is shootable and will show damage when shot. Windows may be shot out, flower pots shatter, etc. Hitting certain items will start mini-games within the game, such as a duck-shooting gallery or a shark hunt. These mini-games serve to increase your score.
 The look of the game is somewhat reminiscent of Lethal Enforcers, except the camera is much more fluid. You will frequently change camera positionsand find yourself shooting at targets on the fly. An almost identical game to Maximum Force in terms of look and game play is Area 51.</desc>

		<desc>MDK is a 3rd person action/shooter game in which the objective is to basically shoot everything that moves in six massive cities, each with their own sublevels. Because the world is being invaded by aliens, it is up to you and your sidekick Bones to stop the invasion and single handedly save Earth. In order to do so, you must make good use of your special suit, which allows you to do all kinds of things.
 The super-suit comes equipped with many features you'll need to utilize in your journey, such as the sniper helmet. This allows you to zoom in on unsuspecting enemies and fire off shots with pinpoint accuracy. There is also a built in parachute (a ribbon-like device) that enables you to glide between different platforms as well as drop down on intruders.
 Your suit comes equipped with a chain gun that has an infinite supply of ammunition. You can also pick up special items, like a miniature nuclear bomb and powerful upgrades for your chaingun. In addition to running around and shooting, there are also special means of transportation including a surfboard-like jet and a bomber plane that is used to call in air strikes.</desc>

		<desc>MechWarrior 2 gives you the chance to participate in the Clan Refusal War, a bloody civil war between the Clans that occurs after the Battle of Tukayyid. The Crusaders, led by Clan Jade Falcon, seek to launch another attack into the Inner Sphere. The Warden faction, led by Clan Wolf, believe that coexistence with the Inner Sphere is the best choice. The war will ultimately dictate which faction dominates the Clans.
 You can play as either a Clan Jade Falcon or Clan Wolf MechWarrior and command a range of mechs ranging from light scout to heavy 100 ton assault mechs. Before missions, each player can select one or more mechs for his or her unit as well as customize equipment and weaponry. Although there is no restriction to stop you from taking the maximum number and tonnage complement, the Clans reward players who take fewer mechs or less tonnage than allowed.
 The game's 3D world is viewed from a first-person perspective. Mission objectives must be completed while evading or destroying enemy mechs. During missions, each player must manage their mechs' heat level and ammunition, as well as command the CPU-controlled friendly mechs to organize strategy. Missions end in failure if the objective is lost or if mechs are destroyed through damage or overheating.

		<desc>The year is 1940, and the conquering force of the Third Reich has invaded France. Nazi Germany has marched into Paris and claimed the once proud nation as its own in its further quest for domination of Europe. The allied forces won't be coming to liberate France any time soon, as they have their hands full protecting Great Britain. The perception that the French have simply let Hitler walk into their country without a fight has not endeared the rest of the war-torn world to the cause.
 As a young woman named Manon Batiste, you will be thrust into the world of intrigue and violence that is World War II doing all you can to save your beloved homeland by joining the OSS and traveling the world as a member of the French Underground, taking out Gestapo thugs and the SS so that you might become a seasoned veteran and aid in the ultimate liberation of your nation.</desc>

		<desc>16, May 1886
 There will be many stories concerning the events that took place in 1886 or as most have come to call it, the Autumn of Death. They have all been dismissed as mere hallucinations, the prattling of drunks or some stage of a sickness. I know better. I was there.
 That night the dead rose from the graves, demons stalked the Great Museum and even mummies walked among the living. Everyone saw a skeletal knight vanquishing all the horrid beasts. I spoke to him. I even aided him in his quest to destroy Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. It's all true. Every word of it! Below is what I was able to uncover about our knight in placid bone. Read closely and heed my words.
 I found an old legend about a mighty knight, whose name I now know to be Sir Daniel Fortesque, that starts around the 13th century. He was a mighty warrior from the land of Gallowmere, now too a legend. He was slain in battle against the insane wizard, Zarok. Unfortunately, Sir Dan's death was for nothing. Zarok lived on and soon came into possession of a book of dark magic.
 Several years passed before Zarok finally deciphered the spell he was looking for. It is written that with this book of dark magic, Zarok awoke the dead to use them in an army. He was delighted and mad with power, so mad that he never realized that the spell worked all too well.
 As the legend goes, Sir Dan arose from his eternal sleep and took up the task he died trying to complete. After defeating all the roving minions of the damned and dead, he finally met Zarok face to face. It was an epic battle of might and magic but in the end, Sir Dan completed his knightly quest started several years before. With Zarok dead, Sir Dan hid the magic book and returned to his eternal rest.
 Now, some 500 years later, I witnessed Sir Dan awaken again. This time it was by the megalomaniac Lord Palethorn of Shoreditch. He was a man from the wrong side of the rails. He even bought a title to make himself feel more important. However, the society elite never really excepted him. That is when he turned to the book of dark magic and cast a spell to raise the dead. He wanted to destroy all of England and become its sole ruler.
 At first sight of Sir Dan I was sick to my stomach. One eye, no skin, he was hideous and a bit angry. I felt badly for Sir Dan, but I was extremely excited by the prospect of having him on my side. Being an older gentleman, I was not fit enough to do battle. My expertise is in the sciences and I know a bit of magi</desc>

		<desc>In a world covered by endless water... People are forced to eke out a living on the small patches of land that remain above the sea. The people of this world rely on ancient technology driven by quantum refractors, a powerful energy source. These refractors lie in ancient ruins underground and in the sea and are sought out by explorers called Diggers. These brave explorers are the sole source of refractor energy which has become a cornerstone of the emerging civilizations. Originally, this was the Diggers' only purpose; to find refractors so that civilization would endure. However over the years, the story of an incredible treasure, the legendary Mother Lode, began to be whispered among the Diggers. The Mother Lode...a treasure so great that were it discovered, it would provide so much power that the world need never fear of running out of energy.</desc>

		<desc>It is the year 21XX, following years after the Doppler rebellion and the revelation of the Maverick Virus, a new global Reploid military force, apty-named Repliforce, was founded to combat the ongoing Maverick attacks and uprisings. However, humans quickly began to fear and distrust Repliforce's military power and their methods of fighting Mavericks proved to be very destructive with little disregard for human life. One day, the floating city Sky Lagoon was under attack by Mavericks and Repliforce arrived on the scene after the city has crash landed on the ground, where one of their leaders, Colonel, was being ordered by the Maverick Hunters X and Zero to lower his weapons for questioning as suspects for the incident. Out of pride and contempt towards human government, Colonel refused to comply, and following the accusations behind the Sky Lagoon incident, the Repliforce General decided stage a coup d'état, seeking to create a new utopia just for Reploids. Repliforce were then labeled as Mavericks by the government, thus the Maverick Hunters must fight against their former allies and stop their coup.</desc>

		<desc>Three weeks after the Eurasia space colony incident, the Earth's surface was severely damaged and humans were forced to flee underground to escape from the planet's severe pollution, and Zero is still missing, presumed to be dead. Reploids were sent in to terraform the land in an attempt to make the planet habitable for humans once more, however, a Reploid and former colleague of Alia named Gate discovered something unusual amidst the ruins of Earth — a piece of Zero's DNA. After examining Zero's DNA, Gate became mad with power and an outbreak of bizarre Mavericks occurred. Weeks passed, Isoc, a Reploid scientist and an associate of Gate, announced to the people that a new phenomenon known as "Nightmare" has quickly spread throughout the world, causing Reploids to hallucinate and eventually destroy themselves. Isoc suspects the cause of the outbreak is none other than Zero who been spreading the phenomenon as he goes, much to X's anger and confusion. Isoc rallies Reploids throughout the world to aid the Nightmare Investigators, led by the powerful High-Max, at key locations to track down the source of this new phenomenon as well as Zero. X, along with the Maverick Hunters, must confront the Nightmare Investigators as they try to solve the mystery behind the Nightmare Phenomenon and clear Zero's name.</desc>

		<desc>A semi-sequel/prequel to the highly acclaimed Metal Gear Solid (MGS), Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions puts you once again in control of the top-level FoxHound field specialist, Solid Snake. This time around, instead of fighting genetically engineered soldiers and saving the world from Metal Gear, you're in a combat simulator. Aboard the Discovery (the submarine that Solid Snake traveled upon before reaching Angel Island), you will prepare for the dangers ahead.

For those that have yet to experience MGS, the gameplay is based around strategy, tactics and action. Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions's interface and concept is similar to its predecessor, but is based on the simulator game mode that was included in MGS. This time, instead of just a few missions, you have nearly 150 different stages to play (300 including the Time Attack modes). Fans of MGS should be able to quickly pick up on the gameplay style. In fact, not only is the gameplay recognizable by fans of the original Metal Gear Solid, each of the missions (although similarities are sometimes minute) are based on events that occurred in MGS.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the award-winning book by David Kirk, Miss Spider's Tea Party offers young children eight games that encourage cognitive thinking skills. Miss Spider is featured inviting her insect friends to a tea party, which they cannot attend until their posed dilemmas are solved. Choosing the order of invite, children help characters like Grampy Spider and Mr. Ant solve their problem and attend the tea party.
			Skill levels of easy, medium, and hard can be chosen to suit age appropriateness and the variety of games include Firefly Concentration, Find the Butterflies, Grampy Spider's Picture Perfect, Assemble the Cricket Band, Caterpillar and Moth Obstacle Course, Beetle's River Crossing, Mr. Ant's Maze, and the Bee Game. The activities in each game are essentially matching and memorization oriented with the exception of Find the Butterflies in which the object is to find butterflies hidden within different scenes. Caterpillar and Moth Obstacle Course, and Mr. Ant's Maze are both maze-type games, while Beetle's River Crossing is similar to Frogger
			Miss Spider and the other characters exchange rhyming dialogue and then give instructions for each game. The invitations are accepted when all eight games are finished. The game ends as credits roll over footage of Miss Spider's tea party with all her friends in attendance as she extends one last invitation to the child to play again.</desc>

		<desc>This game is basically an update to MLB 99 with a few new features. The game contains depictions of the real teams, stadiums, stats, and players that reflect their real life counterparts. The modes returning from the previous game include quick play, season, playoffs, spring training, and home run derby. One of the new modes is general manager mode. In this mode, players can draft, create, trade, call up, waive, release, and sign players. Another new mode is the manager mode. In this mode, players can check out scouting reports during the game, warm up relievers in the bullpen, and try to get their team to the World Series and hopefully win it.

Vin Scully makes a return from the last game to do the play by play commentary, and is aided by Dave Campbell who does the color commentary.</desc>

		<desc>This baseball game is an update to MLB 2000. The game contains depictions of the real teams, stadiums, stats, and players that reflect their real life counterparts. This game features Exhibition, All-Star Game, Season, Playoffs, Spring Training, and Home Run Derby modes. There is also a Franchise mode that let's the player build a team from scratch and try to turn it into a World Series caliber team. Another feature the game has is Manager mode which lets the player  check out scouting reports during the game, warm up relievers in the bullpen, and try to get their team to the World Series and hopefully win it.

A unique feature of this game is the Total Control Fielding and Total Control Batting systems. The batting system effects how much control the player has on how the ball is hit, which direction it gets hit to, and the power of the batter's swing.The fielding system lets the player have more control over the fielders. There is also an Advanced Batting Cursor option where guessing the pitcher's pitch correctly let's the player lock on to the pitch for more power while guessing incorrectly will make the batting cursor shrink and make the ball harder to hit

The Artificial Intelligence used in the game was developed with consultation from Tony Gwynn, Trevor Hoffman and Davey Johnson. Vin Scully and Dave Campbell are on hand to supply commentary during the game.</desc>

All real-life Major League Baseball players and teams are represented with stats and ratings based on the 2001 season. Games take place in virtual recreations of authentic stadiums, and Hall of Fame announcer Vin Scully calls the plays while veteran sports analyst Dave Campbell supplies color commentary.

		<desc>One of the earliest in Sony's MLB franchise, MLB 98 features the standard set of many baseball games.  It has all of the 30 MLB teams and many of the major players, rendered in 3D polygon graphics with complete up-to-date (for that time) rosters.  Real stadiums are also included along with the updated rules including the Interleague play rule that was implemented at the time.

It also has the standard set of modes including Exhibition, Season, Playoffs, Home Run Derby, All-Star Game and World Series.  Players can also create and save their own players and customize them to their liking as well as keep extensive track of stats.  They also have the option to run a franchise at the same time and manage everything including trades and free agency.

The controls consist of using certain buttons to either run the bases, bat and throw specific pitches depending upon the pitcher and the D-pad to move outfielders.  Also, to throw to bases the player uses the main buttons (Triangle, Square, Circle and X).</desc>

		<desc>Sony's MLB 99 offers a number of options to set it apart from most games based on the national pastime. The first advancement is a Spring Training mode. This involves creating a player at any position and nurturing him in spring training; if he does well both in the field and at the plate, he'll earn points.
 If you manage to reach 50 points by the end of spring training, the player will make the parent club's roster. It doesn't just end there, however. The pressure is on your player to maintain his right to play in the majors. If you continually strike out or miss routine grounders, then it's back to the minors.
 Other notable features include over 200 authentic pitching motions and batter stances, 300 unique animations (including collisions at the plate), and Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully calling the play-by-play. The game features both Major League Baseball and MLBPA licenses, so you'll get real players (based on the 1997 season), authentic uniforms and actual stadiums.</desc>

This is a very realistic and highly detailed simulation which accurately recreates the Mobil 1 British Rally Championship. 36 tracks are available, all of which have been created by mapping the real life locations to create a highly accurate racing experience. There are also 22 rally cars to race in which have also been created from their real life counterparts. Although the name of the game is Mobil 1 British Rally Championship, it simply says "Rally Championship" on the front of the box and the game manual. Ignoring this little problem this game is an excellent addition to Europress' rally series and possibly the most realistic racing game ever.</desc>

Completed missions in single-player story mode become available for two-player free mode, with one player manning the cannons and the other the tank, as well as for two-player VS mode. In VS mode, five tanks are available from cleared story mode missions, with another five added based on the number of cumulative defeated Earth army tanks.
 Tanks are rated in speed, range, power, energy, armor level, and recovery ability, and can be upgraded with generic equipment such as a Hyper Engine, L-Range Unit, Armor A, B, and C, Super Cannon, and Spare Energy. In-game screen displays show radar, opponent's tank, speed gauge, energy gauge, lock-on sights, armor level, and movement. Damage is calculated based on the distance between combatants. Closer shots are more damaging but being too close or behind a wall may actually prevent a shot.
 Features:
 Ten simulated tanks from WWII era
 Completing missions in single-player story mode opens areas for two-player free or VS modes
 Separate controls for tank and cannon movement</desc>

		<desc>Based on the cartoon series, this 2D side-scrolling action game (with 3D elements) has you seeking out Master Subodye to learn the four magic spells: fire, freeze, shrink and strength. Use these powers in over 30 worlds (five levels featuring 28 scenes and 16 opponents) to gain items like the Power Rod in order to survive the game. Then travel the world to gain other magical items and defend your monkey friends from, well, everybody.

With a playful spin on one of the great Asian folk tales, Sunsoft's Monkey Magic is filled with martial arts moves, environments and exotic, Eastern melodies. Can you set a world right when it doesn't want to be corrected? Are you "monkey" enough to survive the attacks of gods and monsters? You bet your prehensile tail you are!</desc>

		<desc>The game of Monopoly has been around ever since the Great Depression-era of the 1920s. The PlayStation version of the game boasts token and property animations, rule variations, real-time board rotation and multi-player link options.
 The premise of the game is the same as it has always been. You have to purchase as much property as possible and then build it up in hopes of bankrupting your opponents and remaining as the only entrepreneur left. You are given $1,500 in cash to start with and must try to build up from there. Purchase properties ranging from Boardwalk to Water Works, put houses on them, and watch your money grow.
 You can play with up to seven other human or computer opponents who will all be aiming for you and your property. You can make deals with your opponents since trades and immunities are available. Just watch out though, because they may try to stab you behind your back.
 If you are in a long, tension-filled game that you need to get out of, you can save the game to an open block on your memory card. The game also supports a mouse as well as the Multi Tap device.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Rancher (Monster Farm in Japan), is a "monster raising" simulation in which you raise your monsters in order to win fighting tournaments and become the greatest breeder ever.

A unique feature is the way you obtain your monsters: from every CD you own. That's right: every CD you own (including PC ones, musical and even 3D0 games) can be used to generate a different monster.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Rancher 2 is at heart an arena fighting game with a lot of ancillary game play thrown in. As a trainer of a fighting monster you have to train, reward, punish, cajole and bribe your minion to build up its statistics. You then take your monster into the arena where it battles with other monsters for cash prizes, prestige, and better stats. Like the original Monster Rancher, this game allows players to create a monster using an innovative technique: you can stick in any CD you own (PlayStation, audio, PC, or other) and the data that is read off the CD is used to generate the characteristics of the monster.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo expands its Monster Rancher line with Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout for the PlayStation. This game is a fast-paced platform jumper in which players race their bouncing characters through extraordinary obstacle courses. Along the way there are several panels which can provide all sorts of power-ups to the characters that find them.
 The game features a versus mode, in which two players can race side by side through the same course. To provide further replay value, the game also comes with a level editor that allows players to design their own Monster Rancher courses.
 When a player steers a monster in a certain direction, it will continue moving in that direction instead of straightening its path or stopping. To change the speed and height of their jumps, players must land on special squares. Only the controller's directional pad is used during the game, no buttons.
 Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout becomes challenging quickly, especially after the first ten rounds. There are generally multiple ways to complete each round, some of which are noticeably easier. At first the special squares that propel players forward earn them additional time and so forth are helpful in raising scores and adding to the game's enjoyment, but by level 16 it's necessary to hit them just to clear levels.
 Features:
 * Over 50 challenging stages riddled with obstacle courses
 * Choose from a number of Monster Rancher characters including Hare, Golem, and Mocchi
 * Create your own fun stages</desc>

		<desc>In Monsterseed, players assume the role of Daniel, a young "ruler" who begins the game by getting himself beaten unconscious, but is rescued by the lovely Kal and her rugged grandfather, Wolf. Daniel learns that the thugs who attacked him are part of an evil gang terrorizing his benefactors' little town. The gang's leader Murdoch is collecting ancient statues to open a gateway to the Dark World, hoping to resurrect an immensely powerful monster. Driven by a sense of duty to repay and protect Wolf and Kal, Daniel pursues Murdoch through labyrinthine mines and ruins, a booby-trapped mansion, and even through the Dark World itself, fighting wild monsters and collecting monster seeds along the way.
 At first Daniel buys his monsters at the town hatchery, but as the game progresses, he obtains increasingly potent seeds to hatch on his own. By adjusting hatching temperatures, different monsters can be produced from each seed. Daniel can also add solutions to a seed during hatching to boost certain characteristics of his monsters.
 Monsters have several characteristics affecting their behavior. For example, willpower indicates how determined a monster is in battle; an "unforgiving" monster is quick to enter battle, while a "cowardly" one may ignore Daniel's commands or even beg to be recalled. Response time indicates how quickly a monster will materialize after being summoned; a "quite slow" monster may not materialize for several rounds after Daniel has summoned it, but a "quite fast" monster responds immediately.</desc>

		<desc>Unclear as to what happened at the end of Mortal Kombat II? The answer is: more Komabt! Mortal Kombat 3 is the third gruesome installment of the game infuriating congressmen everywhere. After the Kombatants lost the second tournament in Outworld, alternate-dimensional home of baddie Shao Kahn and his sorcerer Shang Tsung, Kahn decided to take over the Earth like any steroid-poppin' supervillian would. Conquering the souls of all but a few select Earthlings, Kahn prepares warriors of his own to meet the likes of Liu Kang and Sub-Zero head on.
 You control 14 selectable fighters (and one hidden one) with the standard two-punch, two-kick, and block buttons, plus a new feature, the run button. MK3 also adds multi-hit combos and level-ascension (basically, you punch a guy through the ceiling and he ends up on another screen) to the MK mythos, rounding out a fine bloodbath for any Playstation owner.</desc>

		<desc>Why do people hate? What causes such intense animosity that a person would go to any length to hurt someone, perhaps even destroy them? These are just a few questions posed by the relationship of Jax and Kano.
 Is it because Jax is a Special Forces agent and must bring Kano to justice? Could it be that simple? Would it justify following him to another realm and becoming involved in the Mortal Kombat competition? Can hate make you so blind that you'd face demons in hopes of facing the one man you truly want to destroy?
 Greater yet is the mystery of how Kano became involved with Shang Tsung and the significance of the Black Dragon. So many questions left unanswered, so many things seemingly left to chance. At least until now...
 In Mortal Kombat Special Forces by Midway, you play as Jax. Your mission is to destroy Kano and his army of thugs, but it won't be easy. You have to explore 3D environments from a third-person perspective and find hidden areas. Punch, kick, and shoot your way through the droves of enemies you'll face. Watch out for thugs armed with guns and other weapons trying to snuff out your life before you can get to your true objective.
 Be sure to pay close attention to incoming messages. They will give hints and help you solve the riddle of hate. They may even lead you to some secret places too. Collect items and weapons in order to increase your firepower and fill your health meter -- there is even a sniper rifle for some long distance attacks. Amass experience points and learn new and devastating combo moves. Pull off one of those combos at the right time, and witness a gruesome fatality.
 Can you overcome your hatred? Or will you be another fatality?</desc>

		<desc>Midway decided to do something a little different with its Mortal Kombat franchise. They decided rather than to make a whole new MK game, they'd make a game that focused on one particular character from the popular series; a mini MK if you will. They'd shine some light on his past and present gamers with a story, rather than mindless fights to win a tournament. The character of choice is Sub Zero, and the game is aptly titled Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub Zero.
 Mythologies remains true to its parent series (up until Mortal Kombat 4, anyway) in a few aspects: all the characters are digitized and the game is still 2D. But unlike the other games in the series, this one's a platform adventure. You're not just fighting to win a tournament, you're fighting to find out the entire back story of Sub Zero. Sure, you'll still be beating up lots of bad guys, but the game is basically a "jump from platform to platform" game. Midway even throws in some RPG elements, such as item collection and a menu screen, to spice things up a bit.
 Features:
 * Explore eight distinct worlds while battling more than 30 enemies
 * Perform ice blasts, super slides, polar blasts, and more
 * Defeat a total of 12 boss characters, including Scorpion, Quan Chi, and Shinnok</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Land is protected by the four gems of virtue: Generosity, Truth, Wisdom, and Courage. These four gems are scattered in the four Wonders of Pac-Land, mystical regions separated from Pac-Land by mysterious force fields. The gems are in place to keep darkness and chaos from falling on Pac-Land.
 Recently, someone has invaded the Enchanted Castle, kidnapping the princess and turning it into a haunted house. Professor Pac believes that whoever is responsible for that attack is planning to attack the rest of the four Wonders. Therefore, he has created a device that allows for someone to pass through the force field separating Pac-Land from the wonders. With this device you, Ms. Pac-Man, must recover the four gems and save Pac-Land.
 Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness is a 3D isometric view action puzzle game. You play as Ms. Pac-Man and must navigate the mazes while avoiding the monsters. Every time a monster touches or hits you part of your health bar is lost, and if you lose your entire health bar the game is over. If you eat a power dot you will be invincible for a short period of time, and can even eat the monsters.
 The game is composed of a series of theme levels, with each level having four gold stars to collect. You can collect a gold star by completing the level, eating all of the dots in the level, eating all seven hidden fruit in the level, or completing the level's time trial. These stars can then be used to unlock the game's secrets. The original Ms. Pac-Man arcade game is also included on the disc.</desc>

		<desc>MTV Sports: Pure Ride is a multi-event snowboarding game that brings trick and stunt action, as well as high-speed downhill jaunts, to the PlayStation. The game contains a number of different snowboarding characters from around the world -- most of them are fictitious, and some are quite wacky in their design. -- and a variety of boards for snow shredding. Each rider and board has his or her (or its) own strengths and weaknesses.
			For those who aren't down with a bunch of silly rules, Free Ride mode allows players to hit the slopes free of score or trick requirements to simply enjoy the thrill of snowboarding. In Tour Challenge, an around-the-world jaunt, there are a number of different requirements for passing levels. There are five different tours to choose from and 12 different events to take on. Beating different levels will release them for use in Free Ride.
			If you're the type that eschews variety for specialization, then the Specialist mode is for you. In this mode, players can take on specific types of challenges, ranging from Big Air to Slopestyle to Half-pipe, shredding through 12 courses to unlock more levels. Stunt Mode rounds out the different ways to play Pure Ride, and in it players must complete 18 stages, hitting a variety of tricks to progress.
			There is also a two-player feature that allows multiple snowboarders to take each other on in a myriad of events. And if you enjoy making your own levels, prepare to rejoice, for Pure Ride allows you to construct your own slopes, making them as tame or insane as you like.</desc>

		<desc>MTV Sports Skateboarding featuring Andy McDonald is the first game from the MTV Sports line, and like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, it combines real elements of the sport with fantastic tricks and parks that would be impossible to recreate in real life.
			The game features a mix of real professional boarders and fantasy characters, and highlights venues from around the world. Every character has the same set of tricks, but they have different stats when it comes to attributes such as balance and jump height. The levels have a number of different goals for players to accomplish, but the only true way to pass a level is to rank high in a judging that takes place at the end of the run.
			Along with the standard bunch of tricks it brings to the table, MTV Sports Skateboarding features an extended system for flat land tricks, allowing for the possibility of even larger combos. There are a number of different game modes, including career, multiplayer and training modes, as well as a high score mode and an Icon Mode where you must find hidden MTV icons before time runs out. The soundtrack contains music from the likes of The Deftones, Cypress Hill, and Pennywise.</desc>

		<desc>Dashing explorer Rick O'Conell has just made a bit of a mistake. In discovering the lost City of the Dead, he's awakened an all-powerful evil known as Imhotep, a cursed priest who was mummified alive in ancient Egypt and is now, as one might imagine, hankering for revenge.
 It will take all of Rick's brains and brawn to make it through the coming ordeal, as he'll have to survive the Mummy's traps and vile legions if he hopes to make it out of the City of the Dead alive. As if that wasn't enough, he'll also have to take on the Mummy itself.
 Based on the 1999 summer blockbuster starring Brendan Frasier, you take on the role of Rick as he swashbuckles his way through this third-person action game, running, jumping and mainly fighting his way to the greater depths and secrets of the lost city.
 Throughout this action-adventure game, players will have to fight off all manner of supernatural beasts, from deadly mummies to scarabs, spirits and hordes of man-eating bugs. But fighting isn't the only task you'll be forced to encounter, as the City of the Dead is laced with all manners of traps and puzzles, each waiting for you to make the one mistake that will see you swallowed whole by the infinite dust of time.
 You won't be going in empty-handed if you take on the hefty task, thankfully, as Rick has a veritable arsenal at his disposal, representing many of the guns and weapons that were used in the movie, from swords to revolvers, and even to magical amulet grenades.
 Pure action isn't the only item on The Mummy's menu, however, as you will occasionally undertake certain objectives with their own unique viewpoints and controls, such as running for your life in a side-scrolling portion. Also included on The Mummy is a trailer for its theatrical sequel, The Mummy Returns.</desc>

		<desc>Muppet Monster Adventure is a action platform game, best compared with Spyro but with Muppet characters and a Halloween or ghost house setting.

The story starts with the Muppets attending the reading of Dr. Honeydew recently deceased uncle's will. Instead of going on a holiday to a tropical resort, Robin and the others find themselves at a rundown, creepy castle. Upon arriving Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzy and others are captured and now it's up to young Robin (Kermit's nephew) to save the day.

The gameplay is best described as a collect-and-explore-em-up. You have to explore all the vast areas and collect gems and tokens. The HUD displays how much you have collected in a certain level. To get 100% you really have to find every corner and figure out how to get onto the hard to reach platforms.

In the first few levels, Robin gains four special powers by collecting special Muppet coins. When all coins of a group are collected, Robin can morph into different types of monsters at certain places. An icon will appear in the top right-hand corner, indicating that you can use this special ability. You can fly or float, climb certain walls, do a karate chop to break obstacles, or gain extra strength to push objects.

There are lots of large areas to explore. After every few levels the setting is changed. You go from the castle courtyards to large underwater sections, from Arabian nights setting to icy snow levels. During the game, Pepe the King Prawn appears in lots of places to give you gameplay advice. In each level, there also are a lot of mini games to be found, such as a race against an computer opponent to get to a certain location.</desc>

Each Muppet movie, 'The Muppet Movie', 'The Great Muppet Caper', 'Muppets Take Manhattan', 'The Muppet Christmas Carol', 'Muppet Treasure Island', and 'Muppets From Space', has 4 related tracks. Therefore, 24 courses in total.

At the outset there are 8 Muppet drivers available: Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Rizzo, Gonzo, Beaker, Rowlf, and Animal. As a reward for winning races more characters are unlocked - with 17 other Muppet stars made available.

Also included, are FMV scenes taken from each movie.</desc>

		<desc>You have just stumbled upon a most intriguing book, a book titled Myst. You have no idea where it came from, who wrote it, or how old it is. Reading through its pages provides you with only a superbly crafted description of an island world. But it's just a book, isn't it? As you reach the end of the book, you lay your hand on a page. Suddenly your own world dissolves into blackness, replaced with the island world the pages described. Now you're here, wherever here is, with no option but to explore.

Myst is a first-person point-and-click adventure where the player controls a character known as The Stranger. Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries. The game is presented as a series of static scenes where the player acts with the environment by clicking and manipulating objects. There are no enemies and it is not possible to die. Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.

The PSP version adds new adventure scenarios and includes widescreen support.

The DS version includes a completely new age, the Rime Age, and, next to a code rewrite, includes new and re-mastered sound effects and video clips.</desc>

		<desc>Collecting seven early to mid 1980s videogames on one CD, Namco Museum Vol. 1 includes: Pac-Man, the first-ever cute character maze game; Galaga, a Space Invaders-influenced shooter featuring a star fighter versus wave after wave of alien spaceships; Pole Position, the first car racing game where you must qualify before beginning the main race; Bosconian, an Asteroids-like shoot 'em up; Rally-X and New Rally-X, car racing maze games in which you use smoke screens to wipe out other vehicles; and Toy Pop, a game set in a whimsical world of presents and toys.
 In addition to playing the games, you can visit the museum. It features many collectible, out-of-print videogame items on display such as a Pac-Man notebook, a Pac-Man towel and a couple of Pac-Man T-shirts. Also on display are various instruction cards, top displays and screen overlays from Pac-Man and the other games in this collection. You'll also find slide shows, trivia and gaming tips in the museum.

		<desc>Nanotek Warrior is probably based (or at least inspired) in the classic Spectrum (and other 8 bits platforms) game Eliminator released and development by Hewson Consultants Ltd.
 In the 23rd century, nanotechnology does man?s bidding. Anything from curing disease to feeding the worlds population has been taken care of by these tiny wondrous nanobots. But what happens when they become self-aware and decided to destroy their oppressors? To save the human race from extinction by its own creation, you are put in control of a new breed of nano war machine designed to fight (and win) this war. Enter NanoTek Warrior.
 A ground-based shoot-em-up by design, the game employs the use of jumping, banking, and strafing as you move forward through 3D tube-like levels. The game is seem from a third-person perspective behind the ship. Some areas place you outside and some inside, but the majority of the game takes place rotating around tubes. This gameplay only differs slightly in boss levels, that allow you to rotate around a central point with no forward motion.
 You can obtain different power-ups including special weapons, health bonuses and extra lives as you play through the game?s 9 levels. Each level is divided into 2 stages, one on tubes and a boss fight afterwards.</desc>

		<desc>Nascar Racing features drivers based on their real-life counterparts from the 1996 Nascar season. Included are three modes of play -- arcade, simulation, and simulation testing -- and a variety of options. Simulation options available are: turn on or off driving aids, adjust tire pressure, adjust wheel settings, adjust aerodynamics, change gear settings, adjust shocks, angle cross weight, angle spoiler, and set wheel stagger.
 While racing, drivers will have to communicate with the pit crew to determine the tire temperature, how many tires to change, and how much to fill the fuel tank when you pit in. There are 16 licensed Nascar tracks included as well, three of which are night races. It's possible to race the full number of laps that actual Nascar drivers run or shorten a race to your liking.

As development responsibilities of EA's annual NASCAR release move to the latter-day Madden NFL designers at Tiburon Entertainment, the title is reinforced with the word "Thunder" in honor of the game's extensive revisions and the series' new direction.
 As in previous versions, this release is fully licensed to feature over 60 real-life NASCAR drivers and all 23 Winston Cup tracks. In addition to smooth, detailed graphics powered by a tweaked version of the same game engine that drives the Madden NFL 2001, this release is also designed to provide more play options, accurate damage modeling, and realistically strategic opponent A.I.</desc>

		<desc>You can race on a variety of courses, from twenty three real world Winston Cup courses, twelve road courses and eleven fantasy courses, including a costal town and a busy city.  There are sixty challenges in all.

When racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races.  Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they'll remember.  They'll try to get back at you in a future race.  Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they'll return the favor to you.  Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they'll try to harm you.

Like the Football Camp mode in Madden NFL 2004, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting.

With the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire.  You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development.

There are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins.  If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do.

As in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you'll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game.  The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.

Tune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.</desc>

		<desc>NBA Hoopz takes an extreme approach to the sport of basketball, in terms of both gameplay and presentation. Just as Midway's NFL Blitz caricatures football with exaggerated personality and arcade-style gameplay, NBA Hoopz presents professional basketball with an emphasis on fast action and amazing plays at the expense of strict rules or an overly sophisticated interface. This game is similar in spirit to Acclaim's NBA Jam series, though NBA Hoopz focuses on 3-on-3 action instead of Acclaim's 2-on-2 format.
 Shaquille O'Neal stars in this title, which features over 500 of his motion-captured moves. He is joined by many other NBA greats from both past and present seasons, some of whom will need to be unlocked. Gamers also have the option of creating their own players and picking their own teams. In addition to the 3-on-3 play, NBA Hoopz features several other challenges for both single players and friendly competitors, including versions of 2-Ball, Around-the-World, Twenty-One, and a Three-point Shootout.</desc>

		<desc>Konami returns to the world of basketball videogames with NBA IN THE ZONE '99, which includes all of the teams and players from the league. While all of the standard gameplay modes like Exhibition, Season, and Playoffs are included, two modes have been added: Slam Dunk Challenge and Three-Point Shootout. In the Slam Dunk Challenge, you choose the difficulty of your dunk and must memorize a series of button presses. The score for the dunk is determined by how well you recreate the button sequence. The Three-Point Shootout calls for you to stop a power bar in one of three locations to get the ball to go through the hoop. You have 60 seconds to shoot 25 balls, so you've got to be efficient if you want to win. No matter how you like your hoops action, you're sure to find what you want with NBA IN THE ZONE '99.</desc>

There are 29 teams to choose from with a full compliment of rosters from the 1996 season and a plethora of offensive and defensive plays to use against their opponents with trick shots like behind-the-back passes, skyhooks, alley-oops, fade-away jumpers and of course the slam dunk.
 There are, however, only five players from each team on the court at one time, similar to NBA Jam. The game also supports an advanced A.I. and is rendered in 3-D polygons. There are two modes to choose from, Exhibition and Playoff.</desc>

Featuring different play modes such as exhibition and full season play, as well as containing full rosters for all the NBA teams and the ability to make substitutions, ITZ2 is loaded.
 Also beefed up is the AI. Not only will it be harder to drive to the basket, gamers have a greater chance of getting fouled-out, with increased foul elements such as offensive fouls and basket-count. So step on the court and get ready for some solid b-ball action.</desc>

		<desc>The NBA Live series of basketball video games, published by EA Sports, is currently one of the leading National Basketball Association simulations on the market.

Starting from NBA Live 2000, the series featured NBA Live Legend All-Stars Teams, that included some biggest names from five decades (50s to 90s). These teams could be used instantly, but to use the players as regular players (e.g. traded, played on regular NBA Teams) they needed to be unlocked. Along the series, some of the rosters were changed due to many reasons as Michael Jordan was on the 90's team through 2004.</desc>

Also, play the legends such as Michael Jordan in 1-on-1 or 5-on-5 games.
 NBA Live 2001 provides the selection of real-life teams and players and the honest gameplay that fans have come to expect from the Electronic Arts NBA Live series of basketball games. The camera follows NBA superstars across the 3D court as they pass the ball, set up plays, and take the shot. NBA Live 2001 improves on the standards established by its predecessors with enhanced AI and better player models.
 The improved announcer commentary, more encompassing crowd noises, and more detailed action in the stands and on the bench make for a realistic, ambient arena. NBA Live 2001 also offers a challenge mode, in which players gain points by performing extraordinary feats like winning by a large margin or sinking several consecutive three-point shots. These challenge mode points can be used to unlock bonus teams and other special features in the game.</desc>

Additionally, each team's home courts have been faithfully represented with realistic detailing.
 NBA Live 96 features a wealth of gameplay options including the setting up of actual defensive and offensive patterns, trading players, and setting your own player rosters. If you've elected to play a Season (either shortened or full), you'll be required to meet roster and trade deadlines in addition to leading your team to victory. Players can choose from box and inside triangle offensive strategies to defensive full court presses and half court traps.
 The Season mode features actual statistic tracking and a full team schedule of games. If you've ever felt like your favorite player doesn't get enough attention, here's your chance to make him shine! Statistics are based on rebounds, assists, points-per-game, etc. Be careful, though -- overplaying the same people over and over again can result in serious injuries.
 Additionally, players can select a Playoffs mode or a single game of basketball. The Playoffs save you the time and hassle of going through an NBA season; just pick your favorite team and play hard for the championship! Single games of basketball can be played with anywhere between one and eight players (a Multi-Tap device is needed for anything other than two-players).
 NBA Live 96 features SGI rendered courts and player models with realistic alley oops, dunks, dribbles, and Virtual Stadium technology. There are also multiple camera views that pan from basket to basket or hover above the action with a television-styled presentation.</desc>

		<desc>Sony's first first-party basketball game, NBA Shootout features the league's 29 teams, each with authentic rosters (based on the 1995 season), stadiums and arenas, and uniforms. Ball players have been motion-captured to represent their in-game counterparts; on-screen NBA stars dribble, dish, drive, shoot, and dunk realistically.
 Spectacular moves can be viewed via the instant replay feature, just as in a live, televised game. With the team of their choice, players can choose to play single games or in an ongoing "Season" mode. Seasons can be either shortened or played in full length, and clubs can trade players with other teams.
 Players can save their modified teams, player rosters, and season progress to a PlayStation memory card. Another option allows players to play through the post-season playoffs, without having to play any regular-season games.
 In NBA Shootout's multiplayer modes up to eight human competitors (equipped with enough multi-tap controller accessories) can play at once, each controlling a different NBA player on the court.
 Features:
 Play alone or challenge friends to eight-player hard court action
 Listen to play-by-play from NBA announcer Dick Callahan
 Featuring all 29 NBA teams and over 300 NBA players including Kemp, Pippen, and Kidd</desc>

		<desc>989 Sports once again delivers simulation basketball with NBA ShootOut 2003. Fully sponsored by the NBA, this title features all of the league's teams, arenas, and players on roster as of August 1, 2002. Audio commentary is once again done by Ian Eagle.
 NBA ShootOut 2003 offers three separate game modes: Exhibition, Season, and Playoff. Exhibition mode allows any two NBA teams to be selected to play one game against each other. With Season mode, gamers can lead their favorite team through a full (or shortened) NBA regular season and playoffs. During this season, gamers can make trades, check stats, and find out about league news. In Playoff mode, gamers go directly to the NBA Playoffs, where they can customize which 16 teams will compete for the NBA Finals. For special features, NBA ShootOut 2003 once again allows gamers to create their own NBA superstar with the Create Player feature. Additionally, in the Create Dunk mode, gamers can design their own high-flying dunks.
 In the gameplay department, NBA ShootOut 2003 returns many of its features from previous installments. The game features signature dunks, artificial intelligence, and actual NBA plays. To make controls easier on players, NBA ShootOut 2003 offers 18 one-touch player commands. The game also features the Total Control option to simplify gameplay. Total Control can be used for passing, shooting, and screening. Finally, ShootOut 2003 offers icon passing and icon defense -- where gamers can instantly pass to a specific player on offense or switch to a specific defender on defense. This is accomplished by pressing the button that corresponds with the symbol above the intended player's head.

While the core engine remains the same as in previous versions, the graphics have been touched up in an attempt to deliver more realistic looking players and courts. Once again players can guide their NBA team to victory using the Total Control system for precision passing, screening, dribbling, and shooting, with more than 50 authentic dunks available to finish off a play in style.
 One-button controls allow players to quickly set up screens, auto defend, or perform pump fakes and special dribbles to elude the competition, with over 450 team-specific plays also available to replicate the NBA experience. All 29 NBA teams from the 2003-2004 season have been included, with both team and individual stat tracking saved to memory card during the course of a season. Broadcasters Ian Eagle and Bill Walton perform the play-by-play and color commentary, respectively.</desc>

 The game includes 3D player models based on true stats, so guys that are seven-feet tall don't look like guys that are 5'10". The Season mode takes you through a full season as your favorite team, allowing you to feel the peaks and valleys any coach would throughout his first year.

		<desc>This game is streamlined and built for speed. With its combination of award-winning gameplay and 2001 updates, NCAA GameBreaker is the best college football game available.
The first college football game on the PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, NCAA GameBreaker 2001 uses the power of this new system to put together the most menacing offensive line ever to take the college field. With every one of the 115 Division I-A teams and stadiums, your gridiron alma mater should be well represented if they're blue chip material. Mr. Keith Jackson is calling the action all the way in one of the most realistic football audio presentations that includes over 30 college fight songs and trash talk from coaches. And speaking of realism, no game of college ball has come close to the incredible details on the field of this game--look closely at the high-resolution graphics, and you'll see mouthpieces, flexing pads, eye grease, and even mesh holes in the jerseys!</desc>

		<desc>EA Sports finally hits the college basketball scene with NCAA March Madness '98 for the PlayStation. Along with a full NCAA license is 107 Division I teams, team-specific fight songs and chants as well as authentic college uniforms and logos. Nine women's teams have also been included, which is a first for a college sports game (or any sports game for that matter). Also unique to this game is the Momentum Meter, which will rise as your team starts to get hot. Once it's maxed, look out -- the crowd will become frenzied and your shooting percentage increases.
 You'll also have the ability to create your very own players, modify rosters, call plays on the fly and use the give-and-go to outmaneuver your opponent. You can also make substitutions for tired or fouled-out players and check their statistics during the game.
 While taking your team through an entire 1997-98 season with a schedule of thirty games, make sure you call the right offensive and defensive formations if you want a shot at winning them. The Exhibition mode is the way to go for single match-ups and practicing control setups. If you're feeling game, take on the Tourney mode -- a 64 team NCAA Championship Tournament! Bring home the glory to your alma mater!</desc>

In addition to the wide range of customizable settings and play modes offered in previous years, the 2001 release of the series offers a new Coach Mode that allows players to guide a team from humble, small-college beginnings all the way to the National Championship game.
			The improved Dynasty Mode features new options as well and several new plays have been added, both for offense and defense. In addition to the 64 men's teams and 16 women's teams from Division 1 schools, the game features 20 famous teams from past championship tournaments.

		<desc>V-Rally 2 is a game based on the world of rally racing. Here precision-driving skill is most important. In each car there are two people, a driver and a navigator. There are 84 races to compete in with tracks all across the world. If that's not enough for you, create your own tracks with the all-new Track Editor.
 V-Rally 2 features 16 different cars, ranging from Toyotas to Mitsubishis and everything in between.
 In the Arcade mode, four competitors compete in a race against the clock. The V-Rally Trophy mode consists of three different track groups (Euro Trophy, World Trophy, and Expert Trophy) and you must attempt to collect all of the shiny pieces of metal. Championship mode is where eight competitors battle to win the title of European Champion, World Champion, or Expert. Each driver faces the clock and then the top six drivers earn points. At the end of the final round, the racer with the most points wins the championship.
 V-Rally 2 features four-player split-screen action, so you and your friends can have a blast trying to top each other's times. Damage can also be done to your car, so watch out for some vengeance-seeking friends.
 The game supports vibration functionality, analog control, the Multi-Tap adapter, and 3-15 blocks of required space on any memory card.</desc>

Much like the first in the series, the sequel has plenty of high performance cars to choose from, including the McLaren F1 or Ferrari F50 and a few concept cars, each handling differently.

Once you've beaten the six tracks, a new track is available to you. It's a fast paced racing game which is intended to play more like an arcade racer than a true simulation.

The main difference between this and the previous Need for Speed game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase you. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while you race.</desc>

Contains the standard Tetris game, as well as some variants.  Some of the new features are puzzle pieces made of individual parts- after a piece lands, some parts may be able to break off and continue down; "wiggly" pieces that not only provide trippy eye-candy, but may allow you to squeeze a big piece through a tight spot; challenge modes where you must clear a cluttered playfield with limited time/pieces.

Allows for solo or competitive simultaneous play.  Also links to a global board via the Internet to compare scores and times.</desc>

		<desc>From the creators of NBA Jam, NFL Blitz provides football fans with a new way to play their favorite sport. Tired of a measly 10 yards needed for a first down? This game requires 30. Think 11 men per side is too many? Try a seven-on-seven match-up. Hate yelling at the stupid referees? They're gone. In fact, such unsportsmanlike acts as late hits and pass interference are actually encouraged in this game -- anything to keep the other team from scoring. Along with the bone-crunching hits comes an accelerated pace as your real NFL players on their 1998 teams turn on their Turbo meters and play with superhuman abilities.
 There are three different play modes in NFL Blitz. In "Arcade" mode, your objective is to defeat all of the NFL's 30 teams as you take on either the computer or a friend. "Season Play" mode allows you to guide your favorite team through an NFL season on its way to the Super Bowl. Besides the standings, stats are also featured in this mode. Finally, "Tournament Play" mode involves three to eight players in a single elimination tournament to see who is best.
 Features:
 Block and run the field alone or challenge friends to a "tackle fest"
 Use the no referee standard to execute illegal moves and plays
 Slay the enemies in your way as you complete mandatory puzzles and objectives</desc>

Also included are new audible calls and voice-overs, smoother animations and new stadiums to play in.

		<desc>No refs... No rules... Just 'classic' gridiron. Late hits, pass interferences, and other penalties are encouraged (though you can't run offside). Cheerleaders in, well, cheerleading uniforms liven up the end of the first and third quarter and there's enough stats to make the mathematically inclined happy. However, the teams features are not entirely based on real life (Indy was at the top), and it is not as addictive as the old-fashioned PC games of the early 1990's, but still a good game for someone who doesn't mind not-so-classic, almost XFL style football.</desc>

		<desc>The American football game contains all the licensed NFL teams, all the players (over 1500 of them) and schedules. Players choose between multiplayer mode or single player mode versus computer AI. Games can be played individually, or players can compete against a series of randomly chosen opponents in the Playoff games. Camera angles can be changed to numerous 3D views that simulate the looks of real television coverage, with a special first-person view also included. Adding to the realism is a simulated voice announcer. The player animations are motion-captured.</desc>

		<desc>In addition to all the features you expect from this series, this version of GameDay includes one-handed grabs, diving into the end zone, and running out of bounds and slamming into the coach.  With a multitap controller, seven players can play at the same time. Also new in this edition of the series is the addition of a play editor and general manager mode.  With the play editor you can select patterns for your receivers and running backs as if you were the offensive coordinator.  In general manager mode, you can play through multiple seasons with one team, cut players, sign free agents, make trades, and even draft players.  Also new this year is the ability to play through an entire game as a player other than the quarterback.</desc>

Another feature is total-control passing and running. Total-control passing lets you lead, overthrow, and underthrow your receivers so that you can throw more completions and prevent defenders from intercepting your passes.  The play editor has been improved making it easier to make new patterns for your receivers and running backs. The general manager mode has also been changed, mostly to help you with the draft so you can easily see what areas of your team need improvement.</desc>

There are four primary modes of play, including season, arcade, franchise, and exhibition. The franchise mode keeps track of full individual player and team statistics over multiple seasons. Players will be drafted, improve throughout the course of their career, and retire into the game's hall of fame. The franchise mode also keeps track of statistics for the coach and the franchise. Career win/loss records, playoff appearances, and Super Bowl wins are tracked.  Season mode allows players to compete for one individual season, while exhibition mode allows for a single game to be played.  Arcade mode features simplified controls for those players looking to simply mix it up.</desc>

		<desc>As the sequel to 1997's #1 selling football game for the Sony PlayStation, NFL GameDay 99 offers several new features designed to improve the gameplay as well as the presentation. First off, the 3D graphics have returned but with double the amount of polygons--bringing the total close to 350 per player. The animations have also improved to deliver one-handed spinning catches, lunges and off-balanced throws. A new zooming camera system will bring you closer to the on-field action, with player photos and statistical updates during the game.
 For the first time in the GameDay series, NBC announcers Dick Enberg and Phil Simms will provide the play-by-play and color commentary, respectively. Over 500 plays have been included along with thirty NFL teams and 1,500 players with ratings based on the 1998 season. The artificial intelligence has been refined to accurately model real-life defenses, with defensive backs backpedaling and shifting based on the player's offensive formations.
 NFL GameDay 99 also offers the following: the ability to create, draft, sign, trade or release players and free agents; four difficulty levels; three game styles (Arcade, Simulation and Total Control); multiple weather conditions; player injuries; complete statistical tracking during the 1998-99 season; and five game modes: Season, Preseason, Pro Bowl, Super Bowl and Playoffs.</desc>

		<desc>Like NFL Blitz, NFL Xtreme is football without rules, and features exaggerated tackles, late hits, and high-scoring affairs. To make the action more up-tempo than ordinary football titles, Xtreme uses a five-on-five setup, which puts an emphasis on skilled position players (quarterbacks, running backs, linebackers and cornerbacks).
 Though different in style from simulation franchises such as NFL GameDay and Madden, NFL Xtreme features real stadiums, players, and teams from the 1998 NFL season. Additionally, Xtreme features three modes of gameplay: exhibition, season, and playoffs.
 For customization, several options are provided. In create-a-player, gamers can create their own extreme player, who can then be signed to any NFL franchise. As for team customizations, players can release, trade, and draft players to an NFL team. Finally, the game features a draft mode, where all the existing players in the game are redrafted by teams. NFL Xtreme is for one or two players and supports the Dual Shock controller.
 Features:
 Action-oriented five-on-five gameplay
 All 30 NFL teams, players and stadiums
 Fluid animations show big hits and quick jukes

		<desc>This football game is a followup to NFL Xtreme. The game contains both an NFL and NFLPA license and features over 125 taunts made by 23 real NFL players and over 150 different player celebrations. Game modes include an Exhibition, Season, Playoff and Tournament mode. Other features include trades, free-agent acquisitions, a draft, the ability to create a player, three difficulty levels, adjustable weather, adjustable quarter lengths, and three different game speeds.

The game is similar to NFL Blitz. It features arcade-style five-on-five football that emphasizes speed of play and hard hits and tackles. Streamlined play calling and the fact that there are no penalties helps to encourage this fast paced type of gameplay.

The game also has two passing interfaces, an icon-based passing method and a one-button method where the computer makes the pass for the player. 

Some offensive moves players can perform include power shoulder charges, double spins, super jukes, stiff arms, and clothesline tackles.</desc>

		<desc>NHL 98 features much faster and refined gameplay (now using four action keys instead of two, removing the need to double-tap to perform some actions), along other new features such as "in-the-fly" tactics developed by Marc Crawford, then manager of the Colorado Avalanche and new commentary lines from Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh and a re-worked interface.
Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures. The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.

As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the 1988 NES game, BLADES OF STEEL, this update delivers detailed hockey physics combined with brilliant, arcade-style animation. You can play any way you'd like, as there are five difficulty levels, five game speeds, adjustable controls, and plenty of other options. Not only does BLADES OF STEEL 2000 include all NHL players and teams, it also has the most complete set of fighting options you'll find this side of a boxing game: you have the choice of several different punch types, and it's even possible to land body shots and tackle your opponent. You can play an entire season, a single game, or jump right into the Stanley Cup Playoffs as you slash and check your way to hard-fought victory. As a GM, you can trade, sign, drop, or create your own players, and the rosters are very easy to manage. Each NHL athlete is graded based on skating, shooting, stick handling, spirit, fighting, and stamina so you know these guys are going to be realistic. Randy Hahn, the voice of the San Jose Sharks, provides in-depth commentary, and the PA announcer sounds uncannily authentic. If realistic hockey and smooth play are your idea of quality craftsmanship, this is your game.</desc>

		<desc>The first PlayStation hockey game features both an NHL and NHLPA license for 26 authentic teams with 650 real players from the 1994-95 season. Players can embark on a full 84-game Season, take on the computer or friend in an Exhibition game, or go straight to the Playoffs to bring home the Stanley Cup. Four different camera angles let you customize how you want to view the action: a diagonal cam, side-view cam, ice level cam, or vertical cam.
 Options include the following: penalties can be toggled on, off, or on except offsides; line changes can be set to automatic, manual or none; and period length can be adjusted to 5, 10 or 15 minutes. NHL FaceOff also features trades, team and individual statistical tracking, full-color player cards, instant replay, an option to create players with twelve different abilities, and signing and releasing free agents (each team can have no more than 25 players). Saving statistics, created players, modified rosters and/or season progress requires the use of a memory card with two to eight blocks free.</desc>

		<desc>NHL FaceOff 99 improves upon its predecessor by upping the number of polygons by 20% and doubling the amount of textures. Other notable features include unique player sizes and faces, motion captured player animation, forward and backward skating, plus players losing their balance and even their sticks. To go along with the now standard Icon Passing, NHL FaceOff 99 uses Icon Switching to isolate a specific player on defense.
 An upbeat presentation is patterned after TV broadcasts with zooming close-ups and dramatic cut-aways. Play-by-play is handled by Mike Emrick, broadcaster of the New Jersey Devils, and color commentary is performed by ESPN2's Darren Pang. In an effort to boost the atmosphere, NHL FaceOff 99 includes hats thrown onto the rink for Hat Tricks, user selectable third jerseys, end-of-the-year player awards, international teams and authentic goalie masks. You'll also get all 27 NHL teams (including the expansion Nashville Predators) and actual players with statistics based on the 1997-98 season.</desc>

		<desc>NHL Open Ice is the NBA Jam for ice hockey, with a 2 on 2 arcade action featuring a full NHL license including actual team names and logos and 120 actual NHLPA players with reflective stats for the 1995-96 season.

The game features power-ups that will aid the players along during a game including the "Hot Meter" which is filled with every score, body check and steals. Once the meter is full, the player will literally catch fire and their stats will max out for a brief period of time, allowing the player to score goals better, steal the puck more often, etc.

There is five difficulty settings and adjustable options such as period time times and cheat options such as "Big Head" mode and multiplayer capabilities for either head-to-head action or co-op play. Chicago Blackhawks announcer, Pat Foley, lends his voice talents to the game for in-game commentary.</desc>

There are three modes of play: Exhibition, Season, Playoff, and World Tourney. The Exhibition mode allows you or you and up to four friends to play a customized single-game matchup, using any of the available teams.
 The Season mode gives you the chance to play an entire 82 game NHL season, including the NHL Playoffs, and Stanley Cup Championship. This includes overtime games, ties, and player injuries. The Playoff mode enables you to bypass the regular season grind and head straight for post season play. The World Tourney mode is similar to the Olympics in that players play for the country in which they were born. Options in this game that hockey fans will be familiar with include penalties, offsides, two line passes, icing, player substitutions, and face-offs. As player-coach, you will be called on to decide your team's tactical strategies for each game.

		<desc>NHL Powerplay 98 is a hockey game where the player can control a team of his choice to bring it to victory and glory. The game modes are the typical genre choices: Either a whole NHL season, the NHL playoffs or a league with 15 national teams. The team logos and player names are official licensed but in contrast to NHL 98 it uses the data from 1996/1997.

The gameplay itself is more action oriented than a simulation and uses several shooting and pass variations which are activated with more or less complicated key combinations. Six camera angles and a instant replay feature complement the TV atmosphere. 

The game also features several tactical possibilities. For eight game situations the player can choose between three behaviours, e.g. how the players set up shots in the offensive zone. During the season there is a option to trade players with other teams. Extensive mid-season statistics, which can be shown for every team in the league, help planning transfers and tactics.</desc>

Since Ray Rocket's new line of boards is not gaining exposure, the team decides to advertise by entering local competitions under his name. Players control any of the four characters to snowboard, skateboard, bike, and inline skate through 16 levels of single-player story mode, free play, or Titos Challenge. Performing tricks and completing tasks as Team Rocket tries to help Raymondo will progress players through the game.
 In Story Mode, the chosen character must complete tasks such as finding bike parts, collecting flags, and navigating through gates in a downhill snowbaord challenge. Performing tricks to earn high scores is another included task. Each level is timed and the tasks must be completed before the time runs out in order to win and progress to the next level. Mad Town and the ski slopes are some of the areas the team will visit in Story Mode with the main objective being to advertise the 2001 line of Rocket Boards.
 Free play allows players to practice tricks and learn the courses without the pressure of the timer. Only the beginning four levels are available until others have been unlocked in Story Mode. One or two players can participate in Free Play. Tito's Challenge is a timed challenge to find hidden seashells in the levels. One player can accept the challenge or two players can work cooperatively to find the shells. Game options include adjustable controls and screen positions.</desc>

		<desc>Obstructed by the challenges of sea life and underwater bad guys, SpongeBob begins his journey through Bikini Bottom with only a jellyfishing net to aid in his defense. Each of the five chapters is composed of four stages, with a golden spatula power-up serving as SpongeBob's life source and underpants giving extra lives. Seanut butter, jelly, bread, and teeth are just some of the items SpongeBob must locate to win the autographs. Characters such as the Mother Jellyfish and Flying Dutchman are but a couple of the bosses that need defeating at the end of every chapter.

SpongeBob's final assignment is to locate items needed to fix the broken TV at Shady Shoals Rest Home. Upon defeating the final boss, players can access a bonus level if they collect a certain percentage of golden spatulas from each chapter. Other characters SpongeBob will encounter include Sandy Cheeks, Mr. Krabs, Squidward, and Gary.</desc>

		<desc>Nicktoons Racing is another Mario Kart clone using cartoon characters from Nickelodeon. The gameplay follows the standards closely: the player controls one of the characters to win races on tracks filled with scattered power-ups and ramps. A meter at the top of the screen shows the current position and the amount of nitro fuel available. Extra fuel can be collected as shiny orbs on the road. The gift boxes contain random power-ups, like coconuts to throw at the other racers, flash lights to temporally blind them, and traps like baby powder, trash cans and green goo to slow down the competition.

The game has four modes for single player. The main cups mode is the championship, where the objective is to arrive at least in third place to qualify for the next race. In time trial mode, the goal is to complete laps as fast as possible, with a ghost car showing the fastest performance to be surpassed. Race for fun is a practice mode, where any of the tracks can be explored without the pressure to win. In relay mode, the player switches characters after each lap.

There are three modes for multiplayer. The cups and relay modes are similar to their solo counterparts, but splitting the screen horizontally in the middle to show the two players. The versus mode is the "one on one" mode, where two players compete directly against each other without any other racers.</desc>

		<desc>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley.

Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.</desc>

		<desc>In NINJA: Shadow of Darkness, players assume the role of Kurosawa, a young but powerful ninja. Unlike many ninjas before him, he is able to summon powers of the arcane; magical spells that do great damage to those cast upon. And he'll need it - the world has been cast into utter darkness in which monsters and creatures from the beyond roam.

There are four different worlds broken into 11 distinctive levels - Kurosawa will travel throughout cemeteries, rocky mountain terrain, coastal areas, deep and dark forests, etc. The goal in each is to survive, which is often easier said than done. As alluded to earlier, monsters (such as goblins) are out for your blood - even fellow ninjas who've turned to the dark side will meet you with resistance.</desc>

		<desc>After escaping from Tomator in The Lost Vikings, Erik, Olaf, and Baleog have lived joyous and fruitful Viking lives. Then one day, after returning home from a fishing trip, the Vikings get captured by Tomator again. Tomator then calls upon a robotic guard to send them into the Arena, which unfortunately falls short when a system failure happens. During the blackout, the three Vikings dismantle the robot piece by piece and wear its parts on their body, thus granting them new abilities. The three Vikings are then sent through time once again when Olaf pulls the switch on the time machine that says "Do Not Touch", which he mistakes for donuts. Equipped with the new robotic gear from the robot guard they destroyed earlier, Erik, Olaf, and Baleog must fight their way through time once again in order to find their way back home. Along the way, they befriend a wolf named Fang (whom they continuously humorously mistake for a different animal) and a dragon named Scorch.</desc>

You follow the trail of Colonel LeMonde, who has terrorized South East Asia. LeMonde is armed with one prototype nuclear missile warhead, modified to catalyze a chain reaction that can completely destroy the ozone layer and thus irradiate the Earth . Your hunt starts in "Indocine" (intended to suggest Thailand or Vietnam), and then moves to the South China Sea to combat Napoleon Hwong, hen to the heart of North Korea to uncovering the nuclear schemes of "Kym Zung-Lee" (intended to suggest Kim Jong Il), and then to Siberia for a final battle. 

With the aid of fellow operatives, you strap up in the good old "Super Apache, -- a fictional helicopter variant that is armed with Hellfire and Sidewinder missiles and with Hydra cannons. There are also numerous other vehicles that you come to be able to use, including tanks and jet fighters. Do all you can to defeat LeMonde and remove him from Southeast Asia!</desc>

		<desc>As you finish off the disgusting mangled monster, you are reminded of your search for the pearl that you're after. As you run down the corridor, you see another atrocious monster. You start to blast away again, using your ammo carefully; the flash of blue light from your gun illuminates the walls around you. The enemy falls to the ground and you stop firing. You slowly lower your weapon while standing in the dark corridor, getting ready to face your next challenge. A grave thought crosses your mind: "The whole city is depending on me; I must succeed, or die trying."
 Enter the world of O.D.T.. Face more than 40 unique enemies, with "artificial stupidity". The game features eight different levels with at least seven sectors each. Each of the levels has its own feel, traps, enemies and huge bosses. The action packed, free roaming 3D areas stream together seamlessly. There are four interesting characters as which to play and each has his or her own special physical abilities. There are also 16 spells to learn and four deadly weapons, each with nine power levels. You must get the pearl, "Or Die Trying" O.D.T.</desc>

He and many other Mudokons are slaves to Molluck the Glukkon, the owner of RuptureFarms: "the biggest meat-processing plant on Oddworld". Abe is a contented floor-waxer First Class and currently Employee of the Year.

At the time of the story, the ingredients of the corporation's three major "Tasty Treats" (Scrab Cakes, Paramite Pies, and Meech Munchies) are quickly running out, with the Meeches already extinct. While working late, Abe overhears Molluck's plan to use the Mudokon slaves as meat products called "Mudokon Pops!", which frightens Abe into escaping from the factory.</desc>

The game is not so much known for its play, which was not bad but hardly amazing, but because it was one of the few to recognize that it's FMV sequences were rather horrible and tried to redeem them by instituting an MST3K-esque set of shadows (Doug Benson and Brian Posehn) at the bottom of the screen mocking it.</desc>

Like earlier video games representing such sports, including the Konami arcade classic Track &amp; Field, the control scheme is based on rapidly pressing two or three buttons to make the onscreen athletes perform.
 Many field events are featured in Olympic Summer Games, such as Javelin, Discus, Long Jump, High Jump, and even Pole Vault. Track events like the 100 Meter and 400 Meter races are included too. Hand-eye coordination is tested in Rapid Fire Pistol, Skeet Shooting, and Archery. Events such as Weight Lifting, Fencing and 100 Meter Crawl Swimming round out the collection.
 Each event can be played in "Olympic" or "Arcade" modes, and a "Practice" mode is available as well. Up to eight players can compete together, provided enough Multi-Taps and gamepads.</desc>

 Eventually, AlphaCore declares war on the human population, attacking it with its own unmanned weapons and defense systems. As a result, desperate human scientists construct a time machine -- AlphaCore must be stopped before it achieves sentience! Discovering their plan, the renegade organism steals the time machine and utilizes it to return to the days of the first computer, ENIAC.

		<desc>The unwitting recipient of a destructive prosthesis -- a powerful blaster grafted onto his left arm -- John Cain awakes to find himself being hunted down by a military organization, with no recollection of the events leading to this predicament. Inspired by Contra and other such titles, One is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter in which players find themselves traversing a variety of locales, from futuristic Blade Runner-esque cities to remote mountainous regions, all in search of answers. 


The central gameplay mechanic is the player's Rage meter. Simply put, John Cain is fueled by rage. By destroying objects, killing people, and generally causing all kinds of wanton mayhem, he will increase in power. Cain's rage is represented by an orb-like indicator that undergoes a number of color changes, from the relative calm of green to an infuriated red, and beyond.</desc>

		<desc>In One Piece Mansion, you control Polpo, a manager in charge of building and maintaining an apartment complex inhabited by a host of wacky residents. Your overall job is to keep tenants happy by keeping their stress levels under control. Each inhabitant raises and/or lowers the stress in rooms around them in a particular pattern. For example, Ai-Chan decreases the stress in all the rooms around her, while Heebee increases the stress in the room directly above him.
 The game largely consists of arranging and moving tenants so their stress causing and reducing abilities balance out. If a resident's stress level gets too high, their apartment explodes. As long as you have a building full of happy residents, you'll receive rent checks at the end of every month. But for each room that explodes, you lose a certain amount of cash.
 You also have to deal with the members of the crime organization Syndicate 5, who take over rooms without paying rent and add extra stress to your paying dwellers. The goal is to increase Syndicate 5 members' stress until they can't stand to live in your complex anymore. And if the criminals wander around, bothering other people, you must drive them back into their rooms personally using your security whistle. Fires pose an additional source of turmoil, and these must be dealt with on a one-on-one basis using the fire extinguisher.
 One Piece Mansion's Story Mode revolves around Polpo's sister being kidnapped by a jealous building owner, and consists of a series of stages with specific goals, such as earning $10,000 or building a complex with 30 rooms. The Endless Mode allows you to build to your heart's content, or at least until you run out of money.</desc>

		<desc>Twenty years after Pac-Man's first adventure in Pac-Land, Pac-Man returns one day to his house only to find it deserted.  Toc-Man and his ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man's friends, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka, and Chomp-Chomp the dog!  Pac-Man must venture to Toc-Man's lair on Ghost Island to rescue his friends!

Hidden through this side-scrolling, 3D adventure game, Pac-Man faces challenging puzzles and games that have appeared in Pac-Man's previous games.  Many things in this game are a tribute to original games and even Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde are back for another chance to get Pac-Man.

There are several kinds of gameplay modes available.  The newest is Quest mode.  Pac-Man can maneuver up/down and left/right on the screen, but the camera is fixed on the side and scrolls along as Pac-Man searches through all the stages of Ghost Island.  The player must collect Pac-Dots, Fruit, Keys, etc to advance through the level all the while defeating ghosts (by bouncing on them) and solving puzzles.  An adventure game, the story progresses as the levels do with switches to be found and chests to be opened.  There is also a scoring system that encourages the player to collect as much as possible.  Make sure you have a Memory card available before starting out on Pac-Man's lengthy quest!

The other two types of modes are Classic mode and Maze mode.  Classic mode is a 100% faithful conversion of Pac-Man's original game.  Maze Mode is the gameplay from Classic Pac-Man translated into a 3D environment.  All the Pac-Pellets, Ghosts, Walls, and Pac-Man are displayed in very pleasing 3D.</desc>

		<desc>The world's youngest superhero, Pajama Sam, is back in his third adventure, Pajama Sam: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet. Serious trouble is brewing on Mop Top Island as the food groups battle for supremacy. The fats and the sweets are forcing the healthy foods off the island and are quickly increasing their numbers in an attempt to take control. To regain order, an emergency Peace Conference has been called to work out a compromise between all the food groups. Compounding the problem is the disappearance of four of the six delegates.
 It's up to Pajama Sam to find the missing delegates and save the day. Along the way, Pajama Sam interacts with many comical characters such as General Beetfoot, the commander in chief of the healthy food groups, Florette, the intelligent broccoli, Granny Smythe, the elderly green apple with so many stories, Sprinkle, a gentle doughnut, Bean Number 47, the distinguished kidney bean, and Zak Zuke, a zucchini with a knack for guessing weight.
 Pajama Sam: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet focuses on strategic thinking and developing decision making skills. Children find puzzles and play mini arcade-style games throughout the story. They unclog a pipe at the Funny Bone, create punch lines to Mickey Hollandaise's already bad jokes, hop on spinning walnuts to keep from getting dunked in the caramel pit, and search the library for an important manual without getting caught by the cranky garlic librarian..
 Features:
 * Help Sam search for clues and solve problems
 * Join Pajama Sam on Mop Top Island where food can walk, talk and even tell jokes
 * It's a different game each time you play</desc>

		<desc>In this sequel to  Pandemonium, the player once again controls the young aspiring sorceress Nikki and the court jester Fargus with his puppet buddy Sid. It is the year of Cheese, and the advent of the Comet of Infinite Possibilities is foretold by the great prophet Nosewasinit. Naturally, Nikki and Fargus are interested in this comet; but they are not the only ones. The evil Goon Queen Zorrscha wants to use the comet for her own plans, so our heroes have to reach it first...

The gameplay is similar to that of the first game; despite the 3D graphics, the gameplay mechanics are those of 2D platformers. The player can select Nikki or Fargus for each level. Each of the two has different abilities. For example, Nikki can jump higher, while Fargus can use his puppet Sid for a variety of attacks. The characters can also acquire power-ups, such as fire and lightning ranged attacks for Nikki or various Sid enhancements for Fargus. There are also level-specific items and vehicles the heroes will encounter on their way.</desc>

		<desc>The young sorceress Nikki, the court jester Fargus, and his side-kick Sid the puppet are the three main protagonists of this 3D platform game. While attending a "Wizards in Training" seminar, Nikki accidentally casts a powerful magic spell, which results in a giant monsters swallowing the whole village. The three friends must now travel to a place called "Wishing Engine", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal.

The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with. The game uses floating camera angles through a vast Prince of Persia-style world. The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives.

Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</desc>

		<desc>Panzer Front is a simulation of tank warfare, a genre not usually represented on console systems. In the game, you are able to take control of over 30 different kinds of tanks, many from the World War II era and ranging from Russian to German to American. There are also several modern tanks, as well as a small host of fantasy tanks created by the developers.
 The game itself takes place during the World War II era, allowing you to take on the tole of either the driver or gunner in any of the tanks. While there is no overall campaign, there are two different modes to select. The first allows you to select the fantasy tanks, and the second requires that you use real life tanks to complete missions. Missions range from straightforward combat with enemy armored lines to more specific tasks, such as defending or destroying a bridge (depending on what side you're currently fighting for). The areas in which tanks do battle are quite large, and there are armored lines as well as infantry fighters to battle against during the course of the game.
 Features:
 * Man a powerful WWII Panzer tank and try to change the tide of history
 * Fight through 25 scenarios using one of 16 powerful tanks
 * Command six bonus fantasy tanks</desc>

		<desc>The time for resurrecting historical events has come. Panzer General was one of the first games (if not the first) that actually gave you the ability to play for the Nazis, and yet succeed where Hitler failed. Having total and complete control over land, sea and air units, you must defeat the Allied dogs as fast as you can (to get a major victory), or slower than in history (to get the minor victory).

The game's quality lies in the quantity of units. There are basically hundreds of Axis and Allied units from World War II, accompanied with "circled" animations and battle sounds, as well as marching or moving sounds. The Main menu is always located on the right side of the screen, with plenty of options and selections you can change to suit your preferences.

A turn-based hexagon strategy game that will actually go faster if you have faster computer, but will always be playable (speed doesn't go up infinite). The first and original Panzer General, this installment would be followed by sequels and many other games in the series using the "General" name.</desc>

		<desc>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her.  But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl.  And remember - You Gotta Believe!

PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm.  The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow.  You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back.  Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased.  Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage.

Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps.  Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own!

The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original.  However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</desc>

		<desc>An ordinary day in New York for rookie police officer Aya Brea. Christmas Eve is the present day, and you've decided to visit the opera theater. Now this is where the fireworks begin. Suddenly audience members are set on fire, toasted completely, and it appears that the lead vocal is the source of this burning terror. Yet you appear to be immune, and as a police officer you're always on duty, so you must confront the danger.

There has to be some connection between the two of you, as that seems the only rational explanation. What if mitochondria are a species on its own, more advanced then humankind, and using them only to create environments and civilization for themselves? What if humankind are just hosts? What if mitochondria are the natural enemy of humankind? That would make Aya their natural enemy, so the battle for survival and uncovering the truth has already started.

The game is played over six days, each day bringing its own quest. Environments range from Central Park and the American Museum of Natural History to a police office and hospital, all of them modeled like realistic places and most of them crawling with bloodthirsty mutant animals. Combat is different from traditional RPGs, as while you still take turns attacking and/or using parasite powers, you'll be able to run across the battlefield and dodge enemy fire or even strike from a better angle or behind. As Aya levels up she will gain access to parasite powers, such as healing or supercharging a bullet with energy. These powers will deplete a recharging energy bar, although the bar will recharge slower the longer combat drags on. Aya will find many guns of various types throughout the game, and every gun can be modified with extra stats, either with special items, or by breaking down another gun to move over its bonus stats or special effects. The same is true for armor Aya finds.</desc>

Weapons and armor now have fixed stats, but attachments can be swapped in and out of them to modify their properties.

After surviving the events of Parasite Eve Aya left her job as a cop and became a member of MIST (Mitochondrion Investigation and Suppression Agency) in order to hunt down the remnant mutants spawned by Eve's awakening. In the year 2000 a new breed of Neo Mitochondrion takes over the Akropolis Tower in downtown LA. Aya is called in and uncovers a secret organization that threatens all humanity.</desc>

		<desc>Australian developer Wildfire Studios changes its focus from big acts like KISS and Austin Powers to American history in Patriotic Pinball. Two tables, Road Trip Coast to Coast and America on Duty, offer seven missions apiece. In the former, missions include rush hour at the Golden Gate Bridge, Muscle Beach, Route 66, Las Vegas, New York, gold mines, and whitewater rafting. The second table features the destruction of Confederate cannons in the Civil War, boot camp, tracking enemy subs, capturing Hill 142, saving the wounded from Heartbreak Ridge, flying a B17 bombing run, and helping Uncle Sam.
 Patriotic Pinball features four gameplay modes: novice, regular, arcade and tournament. In novice mode, the ball saver remains active longer than in regular mode (5-ball play with extra balls, end-of-game matching, and a bonus round), while arcade mode offers only three balls with extras awarded based on score. Tournament mode eliminates the various extras (Wild Fireball, number matching, and points) and awards only extra balls as a bonus. Both tables track and save high scores to memory card.</desc>

		<desc>PEAK PERFORMANCE is a racing game based on the Chevrolet Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The signature course, Pikes Peak Hill Climb, is a solitary climb up a mountain, with more turns on one track than most have in an entire game. This track, as with half of the other four courses, features a combination of dirt and pavement in both urban and rural settings, providing enough variety and difficulty to keep things interesting. Each of the game's 25 cars has its own feel, giving the game a good amount of depth and keeping the replay value high. Each car can also be colored, named, and completely customized, right down to the wheels.</desc>

		<desc>The follow-up to 1996's Revelations Series: Persona, Persona 2 is a role-playing game pitting high-school teenagers against demons. While investigating the rumor of a curse at the Seven Sister's High School, magazine editor Mary Amano comes face-to-face with a murderer. A mysterious man by the name of Tatsuya Suou saves her, but from this moment on her life is irrevocably changed.
 As with many RPGs, players can gather a party of characters with distinct personalities and attacks. When a random battle begins, the player must first decide upon specific attacks and character turn-order before the fighting begins. Battles will continue until one side is eliminated, although there is also an option to partake in more traditional turn-based battles. Personas, the characters' powerful alter egos, can be used in battle to perform some of the more devastating attacks in the game. That said, not all encounters in the game need to be solved through fisticuffs.
 By using the game's Contact system, players can negotiate with demons and ask them questions. Each character in the party has a different way of negotiating and using the correct negotiator can mean the difference between a successful or failed negotiation. Success will sometimes result in the player receiving money, information, or Tarot Cards -- powerful items that can be used to summon new Personas.

		<desc>The follow-up to 1996's Revelations Series: Persona, Persona 2 is a role-playing game pitting high-school teenagers against demons. While investigating the rumor of a curse at the Seven Sister's High School, magazine editor Mary Amano comes face-to-face with a murderer. A mysterious man by the name of Tatsuya Suou saves her, but from this moment on her life is irrevocably changed.
 As with many RPGs, players can gather a party of characters with distinct personalities and attacks. When a random battle begins, the player must first decide upon specific attacks and character turn-order before the fighting begins. Battles will continue until one side is eliminated, although there is also an option to partake in more traditional turn-based battles. Personas, the characters' powerful alter egos, can be used in battle to perform some of the more devastating attacks in the game. That said, not all encounters in the game need to be solved through fisticuffs.
 By using the game's Contact system, players can negotiate with demons and ask them questions. Each character in the party has a different way of negotiating and using the correct negotiator can mean the difference between a successful or failed negotiation. Success will sometimes result in the player receiving money, information, or Tarot Cards -- powerful items that can be used to summon new Personas.

		<desc>Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf is the PlayStation port of an arcade series that found great success in the late '90s. While the various incarnations of the arcade game were played using a trackball, the PlayStation version uses a standard controller.
 Golden Tee Golf features 3D terrain mixed with sprite-based graphics for objects such as players, trees, and tees. There are six different courses to choose from initially, with mirror versions of each course available after being unlocked. These courses range from sedate locations on relatively flat areas to difficult canyon playfields.
 There are several modes to choose from, including a Strokes game and a Skins game. You can also play Speed Golf, which will take you through a single game in record time, or Club Roulette, where you'll have to get a grip on how each club handles if you're going to take the top spot. The game can be played by up to four different golfers, although there are no characters to select. You simply name your character and are then known in-game as Player 1 through 4.</desc>

		<desc>The nefarious pirate Captain Hook found a map to Neverland's hidden treasure and intends to plunder it. Since he now knows where the treasure is located he hacks up the treasure map to pieces and scatters the pieces throughout Neverland so no one else will be able to locate the treasure. Meanwhile, the fairy Tinkerbell informs Peter Pan that there is a treasure somewhere in Neverland. So now Peter Pan and Tinkerbell are on a quest to locate the hidden treasure too by finding and putting back together the pieces of the sliced up treasure map.

Players take the role of Peter Pan and occasionally as Tinker Bell throughout 20 different stages. Some of the stages include Hangman's Tree, the Mermaid Lagoon, Pirate's Cove, Indian village, and Skull Rock.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour 96 for the Sony PlayStation will transport you into 3D rendered professional golf courses, providing excellent rounds of golf at a fraction of the cost in actual life. You'll get to play against professionals and compete for thousands of dollars all with just a few button pushes!
 Whether you know how to play golf or not, PGA Tour 96 will produce a feeling for the actual game play. For golfers, I suspect the game will create a desire to go out and play the real thing, and for others to give the game a try.
 There are five different modes in the game. Stroke play is a regular game of golf consisting of either the front 9, back 9, or all 18 holes of a particular course. Practice play allows you to play any hole on a golf course to improve yourself. In Tournament you'll play against fifty-six other PGA Tour professionals plus the one to four players in your party and compete for cash by playing either 18, 36 or 72 holes. If you're playing 72 holes, you'll have to make the cut by being one of the top 40 players after the first round. The Skins Game assigns a monetary value to each hole and you'll want to win as many as you can by playing either the front 9, back 9 or all 18 holes. The Shoot-Out is the last game playing mode where four players line up to play three holes. The player with the highest score is eliminated at the end of each hole. The first and second places receive a cash award.
 In PGA Tour 96 for the PlayStation, two professional PGA courses are included. They are the SpyGlass Hill Golf Course located on the Monterey Peninsula in Pebble Beach, California, and the TPC at River Highlands located in Cromwell, Connecticut. Each course has an introductory full motion video explaining both the courses history and future.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour 97 is basically an upgrade of PGA Tour 96, a game that appeared on the Genesis as well as the PlayStation.
 Two new courses have been added, Sawgrass and Spanish Bay. Before playing each hole you can view a fly-by that may help plaers to devlop a strategy. Hitting the ball is performed using the usual power arc. Using the arc, players not only affect the power of their shot, but also the accuracy of their shot. Multiple camera angles are available for players to view all of the action from.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour 98 ups the ante for PlayStation golf games with five actual PGA Tour courses, including Pebble Beach, Colonial Country Club, TPC of Scottsdale, the Bay Hill Club and TPC at Sawgrass. Select one of 14 PGA pros to play as or against, or create your own golfer and edit the name, default animation and difficulty level. Before you set foot on the links, choose from eight different types of play: Practice, Stroke Play, Shoot-Out, Skins Game, Foursomes, Match, Four-Ball Match, Skills Challenge or a Tournament against fifty-eight PGA Tour professionals.
 The PGA series from EA Sports has been known for its options and this version is no different. Players are free to customize nearly every aspect of the game, from mulligans, handicaps, tap-ins, fairway conditions, greens conditions, wind strength, lie effects, camera views, to even the degree of caddie assistance for four different phases of the game.
 If you are familiar with other golf games, you'll know that most feature an arcing swing meter that you use to determine power and accuracy. PGA Tour 98 includes this as a default, but offers an arcade option which presents the swing as a vertical bar. Of course, you can still play for draw or fade or set the amount of backspin for whichever method you decide to use. Wrapping up the package is commentary by Ernie Johnson Jr., support for up to four alternating players, and all of your golfer's statistics saved to memory card. See you at the clubhouse!</desc>

In Philosoma, you lead that team through 18 environments in search of the mysterious distress call, destroying enemies and obstacles in your path.
 Go up against a variety of vehicles including the "Hover Carrier," the "Makkon," and the "Missile Walker" as you clear your way with one of four main weapons such as the Vulcan, Laser, A-Break, or Ray-B. Each weapon can be upgraded up to three times when specific power-up icons are collected. A secondary weapon such as Buster grenades, MRMs, and SRMs are equipped at the beginning of a level or acquired through a power-up.

		<desc>Billed as an action-adventure game for the whole family, this "E"-rated 3D platformer puts players in control of Phix, who must return a special object to a remote location. How was Phix to know the importance of that magic stone that fell from the sky? Still, he probably shouldn't have eaten it -- now the world of Magnetica is in turmoil and only Phix can set things right.
 Reminiscent of the Dreamcast's Super Magnetic Neo, many of the game's puzzles and challenges are conquered by altering positive and negative magnetic forces. Phix will also face fierce creatures and collect special crystals as he makes his way to the Sanctuary, to return the magic stone to its proper place and Magnetica to its former, peaceful state.
 Features:
 * Instantly switch polarities to solve puzzles and defeat enemies
 * Explore five worlds, each featuring multiple stages and a boss encounter
 * Quickly race through each level before time expires</desc>

 This side-scrolling platformer is presented in a graphical style designed to match the beloved series of United Artists cartoons. Players guide the Pink Panther though a variety of dangerous environments. He'll have to keep his classic cool as he faces dangers of game levels such as the Stone Age, the Gangster's Hide-Out, and Dracula's Castle.
 Many zany objects and gadgets can be found along the way to help you reach your objectives. You'll be using lampshades, paint, fire extinguishers, magnets and even bowling balls. Disguise yourself, blend into the background, disarm traps and fight off enemies.</desc>

Players can use the Game Link to collect and trade items with friends for power-ups.</desc>

		<desc>Set in the 23rd century, Pitball is the only sport left in existence. There are no rules in this violent battle -- your objective is simply to score as many goals as possible while destroying the other team.
 Before jumping into the action, you'll select from one of twelve available teams. Consisting of two players per roster, teams include human beings and various alien races, each with their own distinctive forms of attack. While the Arquons utilize a series of oceanic attacks, the stone creatures of the Slorillians use volcanic rock to decimate their opponents.
 In this brutal sport, the idea is to smash up the other team in an attempt to make them drop the ball; the ball is made of pure energy. To help your team become stronger, you can purchase items and free agents. Money is gained from bank loans, team sponsors and by placing bets on games. While on the playing field, your team can obtain special power-up items that increase power, revitalize hit points, shield players from attacks and grant other mysterious effects.
 Pitball includes several gameplay options including Training, Single Game and Season modes. The Training mode is specifically designed for novice players and newcomers. Played on a holographic field, it teaches you the basics of gameplay. Whereas the Single Game is simply an exhibition match, the Season is a furious battle to the championship. There are also multi-player options including competitions for two, three and four players and a cooperative Versus mode. When more than two people are going to play, however, a Multi-Tap is needed.</desc>

		<desc>Pitfall 3D is a 3D platformer in which players guide Pitfall Harry Jr. (the original Pitfall! hero's son, voiced by B-movie king Bruce Campbell) through a wide variety of settings, ranging from the South American jungle to the ruins of the Moku civilization that lie behind a dimensional rift.

 Some old obstacles and enemies appear, such as tar pits that can open up beneath Harry and swallow him whole, ever-present scorpions, and old favorites like rolling logs and handy vines, which can be found smattered around the jungle. But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense.
 Harry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old Dad.
 Features
 * Explore the landscapes of an active volcano, a prison colony, and Scourge's lair
 * Swing, jump, and hurdle to avoid enemies and obstacles in each environment
 * Lead Harry through a variety of levels in a different world to save Earth from an evil temptress</desc>

		<desc>The Planet of the Apes is an action/adventure interpretation of the 1968 film (which is itself an adaptation of the Pierre Boule novel). While the game's setting and opening sequence are based very heavily on the original film, the storyline is new and deals with the poignant social conflicts of the futuristic Earth from its own perspective. The game world is a land ruled by hyper-evolved apes in which human beings live like wild animals, without language or civility.
 Players take the role of Ulysses, the human hero of the game. As in the movie, the hero is an astronaut who is transported to the post-apocalyptic Earth when his ship crash-lands in the wilderness. Unlike Charlton Heston's Taylor in the film version of the story, Ulysses realizes fairly quickly exactly when and where he is. The game's most surprising revelations come from other discoveries that Ulysses makes as he proceeds through the adventure. The depth of the plot becomes more apparent as Ulysses discovers that many consider his presence on the planet to be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy, in which a human messiah would fall from the sky to save mankind from its collapsed state. For what it's worth, Ulysses does not feel very much like a messiah.
 Gameplay follows conventions established by popular titles like Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid. The action is viewed from a third-person perspective, with the "camera" behind the hero's shoulders and panning occasionally to offer a better view in tight spots. While there is plenty of action and combat, the all-important storyline relies on character exploration and interaction for its progression. The game contains hundreds of lines of scripted dialog and Ulysses can have conversations with most non-player characters.
 One of three "modes" determines how Ulysses will approach a given situation. In "normal mode," the hero walks about at a regular pace. In "athletic mode," he is ready for action, running from place to place and able to jump and dodge quickly. In "stealth mode," Ulysses crouches down and moves as silently as possible, allowing him to explore hidden areas without being noticed by guards and other apes. All three modes of action are required to guide Ulysses safely through this diverse and dangerous Planet of the Apes.
 Features:
 * Based on the movie, players take control of the astronaut Ulysses
 * Infiltrate Ape City and stop General Ursus from exterminating humans
 * Battle bats, hyenas, baboons, rats, and more</desc>

		<desc>Point Blank is a light gun arcade game, in which players shoots targets in a wide variety of stages. The Playstation version uses the G-Con gun, for action similar to Time Crisis, also by Namco.

The game has a distinct cartoon theme and is non-violent, making it suitable for all ages. Each stage has a different objective, explained at the start of each stage. This varies from simple target shooting (and avoid to shoot bomb), shooting cardboard villains (avoid shooting cardboard civilians), shooting own color targets (avoid shooting opposing players color), protecting the iconic Dr.Don and Dr. Dan, and many miscellaneous challenges such as the Galaxian stage where lightgun is used in place of spaceships to shoot aliens.

The stages are presented in groups of 4 and the player or players can choose in which order to play them. You lose a life-heart when you shoot an incorrect target or bomb, or when you fail to complete a mission within the time limit.

As well as converting the arcade game in its entirety, this conversion also offers a new Quest mode, a Party Play system and more.</desc>

		<desc>Point Blank 2 is the sequel to the now classic arcade game Point Blank, which was converted to the PlayStation in 1998. Using the Namco built GunCon (an arcade-like light gun), it offers 70 new shooting galleries, different party modes and a new single-player game.
 If you're playing single-player, you have a few options from which to choose. The arcade mode is simply 16 rounds (of either beginner, advanced or insane difficulty) selected randomly from the 70 different shooting galleries. You'll get to shave sheep by shooting off their wool, test your accuracy in one-shot, one-hit bouts and save Dr. Don and Dr. Dan from wacky situations. There is also an endurance mode in which you climb a tall tower to see how far you can get in three tries.
 Out is the old single-player role-playing game from the original and in is an action-packed adventure. There are four rides to choose from, each with their own theme (like a haunted house and a submarine). The objective is to gain clues to save the King's daughter. To get new players familiar with the game controls, there is also a practice mode.
 If you've got a friend or a group of friends, Point Blank 2 features a wide variety of different play modes. The arcade games are enabled as well as turf wars, tournaments and a team-play option. You can also give certain players handicaps or enable penalties. Up to 8 people can play by alternating Guncons.
 Point Blank 2 ships in two different packaging formats, one with a Guncon and one without.</desc>

		<desc>The escapades of Namco's Dr. Dan and Dr. Don continue in Point Blank 3, the third edition of the irreverent, mini-game based light-gun series. A selection of 80 events are offered, many of which thrust the hapless duo into situations that require timely intervention by the player on their behalf, testing your reflexes and shooting accuracy at the same time. The myriad of events present the player with basic tasks that range in both scope and difficulty. A plethora of mini-game formats are provided that include shooting color-coded targets to protecting the two numbskulls from threatening objects, to those that require the player to perform rudimentary mathematics calculations before shooting the correct answer. Cameo appearances by Tekken characters, classic Namco franchises and other such in-jokes abound in the many scenarios players will find themselves embroiled.
 Arcade, Training and Endurance modes cater mostly to single play, while the Versus and Party modes support multi-player competition, the latter for up to eight players in a tournament-style elimination event. 
 Arcade mode grants one or two players the opportunity to advance through 16 randomly selected stages on the difficulty level of their choosing, while Training lets players practice any of the available levels. 
 Endurance sees players attempt to pass as many stages as possible with the scant three lives supplied. After every ten stages a bonus event is provided that gives the player an opportunity to earn extra lives or points. The game supports play with both the standard controller and Namco's GunCon peripheral.</desc>

		<desc>The classic videogame PONG is getting a 32-bit update. Players control a long, flat rectangular rod and maneuver it up and down the screen to defend their goal. The opponent is trying to direct the ball past you and into your goal the player who reaches the level's preset point total first wins the match. There are six zones filled with all kinds of PONG challenges, each with three distinct and increasingly difficult variations on that level. Most one-on-one games also include power-ups that you can collect, which will benefit you in some fashion against your opponent.</desc>

		<desc>Doukyu Billiard Master (known as Pool Hustler outside Japan): You're a hustler, baby. Weaseling your way from underground pool halls to even seedier settings, the objective is to play the best game of pool possible while wagering high amounts of cash. But no matter how good you think you are, there's always someone better than you...or is there? Pool Hustler will give you the opportunity to find out!

Pool Hustler features several gameplay options including the Lesson, Story, Two-Player, Practice, and Trick Shot modes. Outlined somewhat in the first paragraph, the Story mode features a city map with six different pool halls. Players will go around to the various halls, make wagers, and try to beat one of 12 different pool champions. Just be careful not to bite off more you can chew -- you'll be left with an empty wallet and the game will be over.
Your opponents range from hustler wannabes to actual pool sharks; the short tempered Joseph acts as a stepping stone for victory while Morgan learned to play a mean game of pool during a 35-year prison sentence. Each player has his or her own unique style and grasp on the fundamentals of pool theory, so watch yourself!
The Lesson and Practice modes are great for new players; while the former teaches players the mechanics of pool via tutorial sequences, the Practice mode is there for practicing trick shots and angles. It even allows you to place balls on a table in any manor you desire! When you've got the necessary skills to take on your pool shark friends, challenge them to a Two-Player duel! Players can select between four different games including Nine Ball, Eight Ball, Rotation, and 14.1 Continuous. Finally, the Trick Shot mode features 30 unique trick shots for the player to master!
Players are required to play in accordance to strict, but realistic rulings. For example, if you sink the cue ball or fail to hit the lowest numbered ball in Nine Ball, you'll be fouled. If you're playing by professional rules only, three fouls result in automatic disqualification. Additionally, general rules are followed such as lagging for break, calling shots, and break options.
So get out there and show them who's the real Pool Hustler!</desc>

		<desc>Porsche Challenge is the first release from the European division at Sony Computer Entertainment. Based on the Porsche Boxster, fans can test drive as well as race one of Porsche's most spectacular looking vehicles to date. So strap yourself in as you prepare to put the pedal to the metal when you push one of the most powerful sport machines to its limits on test tracks set right across the globe.
 The Porsche Boxster is a machine capable of going from zero to 60 mph in a mere 6.7 seconds, powered by a six-cylinder, 24-valve twin overhead camshaft. With 201 horse power at 6,000 rpm and 181 pound-per-foot of torque at 4,500 rpm, the Boxster is well known for its amazing power and top speed at 200 km per hour. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has been able to create the 3D model by blueprints of the vehicle from Porsche engineers and have created the car all the way up from gouraud shading and real-time lighting effects for maximum realism and effect. The View Boxster option allows players to watch a documentary film on the Porsche's and Boxster's creation with the history told from the viewpoint of the engineers themselves.
 Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has also created four test grounds for testing and racing the Boxster. These include U.S.A., Japan, Alpine, and Stuttgart, the official testing track for Porsche vehicles. These tracks have been further opened up to create a total of 20 track combinations through the use of opening up new paths, and racing the tracks in reverse.
 The single-player side of Porsche Challenge is split into Practice, Time Trial, and Championship modes. Championship provides a collection of 12 races with five other competitors per race, as well as being available through three different difficulties. The two-player option allows players to play either Single Race or Championship modes with the options to play Arcade or Simulation style where they can switch on or off, catch up, and choose one- or two-player delay. Players can also select what driver they want to use with each sporting a different color Boxster, as well as a racing personality.
 Options in Porsche Challenge include a CD player that allows: alignment of the four provided electronic tracks with each course (tracks include "Asian Beats," "Alpine Funk," and "Tribute to Dragon"), output effects, change music and sound effects volume, high scores, button configuration, and automatic and manual selections. English, French, and Italian languages are also offered. </desc>

		<desc>POWER PLAY: Sports Trivia tests the knowledge of up to four players in hockey, baseball, basketball, football, or all four areas. Once a sport is selected, players can elect to play a Tournament Game or Last Man Standing. Tournament consists of a series of ten increasingly difficult multiple-choice questions worth 100, 200, or 300 points apiece.
 Players who continually answer correctly after buzzing in will receive a "streak" multiplier in addition to points, but an incorrect answer deducts points from their total score. The person with the most points at the end of the game wins, receiving an overall ranking as well as a possible Hall of Fame induction after achieving a high score.
 Last Man Standing follows the same structure but with a finite number of allowable misses, the default being five. Once this number is reached, the next player in line continues until only one remains. Both trivia contests conclude with a gold, silver, and bronze medal ceremony based on overall points. High scores, rankings, and question progress (from the pool of 4,000) are then saved to memory card.</desc>

		<desc>Saban's Power Rangers Time Force brings the 2001 incarnation of the long-running Fox Kids show to the PlayStation. Players will take on the role of one of five Power Rangers -- red, green, blue, yellow and pink -- and battle evil throughout the universe and throughout time. Each Ranger has his or her own different attribute levels in categories like power, speed and martial arts skill.
 Each of the game's eight levels takes place in a different time period. Players will have to tame the Wild West, take down evil cavemen in the Stone Age, and go toe to toe with pirates on the high seas. Most levels require players to find objects scattered about the level before they can go on to fight the boss. And once they beat a boss the first time, it will mutate into a giant sized version, as on the show. It is then necessary to dispatch the villain by taking control of the Power Rangers' famous Blue Zord.
 Once a character has entered a level, they have a certain amount of time to complete the stage. If the timer runs out, the level doesn't end but players won't receive a power-bar bonus. To best the clock in any given level, players will come upon small and large hourglass icons. These icons slow down the clock or add a large chunk of time. Players will also find health power-ups and charger stations where they can regain the power to perform special maneuvers they will learn throughout the game. And if you run out of time in a level, you always have the opportunity to give it a try again.</desc>

		<desc>A first-generation tennis title made available shortly after the PlayStation's launch, Ground Stroke offers basic singles or doubles match options. The roster of eight players consists of four men and four women, none of whom are licensed professional players, but obvious caricatures thereof. The full roster includes Andre Legacy, Bart Sunrise, Steve Edwards, Mike Lee, Rusty Guriffis, Angela Santos, Julia Cappuccino and Kumiko Abe.
 Before beginning a game, options such as the number of sets (one, three, or five) and the court type can be set. The latter includes grass, clay and hardcourt surfaces. Though each player has specific attributes, each is capable of performing a standard array of strokes including drop and lob volleys, slices, top spin shots, approach shots, and overhead smashes.
 New players can be "registered," allowing for in-game tracking of their win-loss record, including win ratios in singles and doubles play as well as the overall winning ratio of each player. Different camera angles and perspectives can be selected, and during two-player competition it's possible to play with a horizontally or vertically split-screen. At the conclusion of a match, a summary is displayed detailing the aces, double faults, winners, unforced errors, break points won, and first-serve percentage achieved.
 Features:
 Take part in singles or doubles competition on three different court surfaces
 Choose from eight players; four men and four women

		<desc>Based on Taito's Japanese arcade game, Power Shovel puts players behind the controls of three earthmovers in a variety of construction-oriented events.
			Three modes of gameplay are available: Arcade King, License Mode, and Level Editor.
 Arcade King includes missions from the coin-op, such as demolishing a car, knocking over houses, and pouring large amounts of curry sauce over rice. Money earned in this mode is used to unlock more mini-games, artwork, music, and other items. Two players can also compete against each other in these events in a best of three competition. Players take turns completing each task until a winner is declared.
 License Mode provides a series of timed tests (like knocking over poles, parking and digging sand) that must be completed in order to gain your operator's license.
 The Level Editor lets players design their own courses on a 6 x 6 grid, with obstacles such as holes, electric fences, cones, and sheds. The three available shovels vary in their size, speed, capacity, and digging ability. In each event, players have the option of a first- or third-person perspective.

		<desc>The Powerpuff Girls is an American animated television series created by animator Craig McCracken and produced by Hanna-Barbera (later Cartoon Network Studios) for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers, as well as their "father", the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who all live in the fictional city of Townsville, USA. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's childlike mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers.
 The Powerpuff Girls revolves around the adventures of Blossom,bubbles, and buttercup . Each of the girls has a color; Bubbles is blue, Buttercup is green and Blossom is pink. The plot of a typical episode is some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu fare, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls also have to deal with normal issues young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain more or less hidden references to older pop culture.
 Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-traction is a 3D fighting adventure featuring characters from Craig McCracken's hugely successful Cartoon Network series.
 Help Bubbles dispense a little justice on the wily Mojo Jojo or guide Buttercup to deliver a nice knuckle sandwich to deserving Gangreen Gang members.
 In the story mode, players can pick up objects and throw them at an enemy to decrease their opponents health meter. They can use superpowered attacks by collecting vials of Chemical X. If the player successfully defeats the enemy in two out of three rounds, they move to the next enemy location.
 Players can play the story mode or can battle against a friend in a head-to-head battle.</desc>

		<desc>A meteor struck the Earth, and caused great chaos. Seven gods from ancient times awoke, and are now attempting to take control of the post-apocalyptic world.
 Primal Rage is a one-on-one fighting game featuring dinosaurs and giant apes as the fighters. The graphics are done with digitized stop-motion animation. Gameplay is similar to Mortal Kombat in that it is viewed from a side perspective, and features deadly finishing moves at the end of the match.
 The game is a conversion of the versus fighting game arcade machine developed and published by Atari Games in 1994 as an arcade video game. Toys, comics, and other merchandise tie-ins were also produced.
 The Playstation version instead of the arcade mode got also these modes: Training, Endurance &amp; Tug of War.

		<desc>Pro 18: World Tour Golf attempts to bring the authenticity of golf to the PlayStation console by incorporating real-life courses and world-renowned PGA and LPGA tournament players. Included is the 1998 United States PGA champion Vijay Singh and Mark O'Mera, who won both the 1998 Masters tournament and British Open championship. There are eight players in all with the ability to create your own golfer.
 There are various game modes including Practice, Stroke Play, Fourball, Shoot Out, Skins, and a Tournament. In the Practice mode, you can practice putting, driving, and chipping the ball on the course and hole of your choice. This is ideal for new players unfamiliar with the ways of professional golf. Stroke Play is simply nine or 18 holes of golf where players try to finish with as few strokes as possible.
 The Fourball option includes two teams of two golfers competing for the lowest score. One person hits the ball and the other team must beat or match that person's score. Whoever has the lowest number of strokes on a hole wins and tees off on the next hole. A Shoot Out involves a money-based tournament where players compete on a hole-to-hole basis. Whoever finishes the hole with the lowest score wins a sum of survival money; whoever has the most strokes is eliminated. Skins is much like the Shoot Out only players aren't eliminated and the hole payments are much more.
 Finally the Tournament consists of four rounds of golf played in the span of four days. There are initially 72 golfers competing throughout the first two days; at the end of the second day, the 36 best golfers advance while the other half is cut from the tournament. In order to win money, players must finish somewhere in the top 18.
 Pro 18: World Tour Golf is played with a 4-click swing meter that allows you to apply spin and add extra oomph to your shots. It allows you to draw or fade around obstacles (hitting the ball left or right), chip from the fairway, and other things found in professional golf. There are three different real-life courses to play though including the Ireland based Royal County Down, The Lost City located in South Africa, and the United State's Coeur d'Alene.
 Additionally, Pro 18: World Tour Golf supports the PlayStation's Multi Tap for up to eight players. Customized golfers, tournament settings and advancements, and course statistics can be saved via Memory Card.</desc>

		<desc>Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey has many features one would expect to find on a standard pinball machine. You'll see bumpers, buzzers, bells, ramps, flippers, gates and plenty of lights. The machine also has a LCD screen where you see your score, current ball count and graphical outputs of on-screen adventure. An option is provided to make it a full color display or leave it in the traditional colors found on a standard pinball machine.
 Each of the machine's quests or adventures requires you to trigger spinners or buttons in order to advance; to even get a chance at a journey that will require you to hit a specific "lit" area of the playing surface. Several other features, such as multipliers and multi-balls have also been included. The game boasts accurate physics that allow the ball to spin, jump, roll and slide.
 Several external features have been incorporated in order to offer a more realistic Arcade experience. For instance, the machine can actually be nudged to simulate aggression or to move a ball one direction; too much abuse of this option can cause a "tilt," at which point the machine resets with your current ball lost. Several other options can also be selected, such as the difficulty of the game and selecting one of three different camera angles.
 Two other features are included in an attempt to heighten the realism of the game. The first is the customization of flipper power, which allows you to alter how hard or soft the flippers hit the ball during gameplay. The second feature, which is machine condition, allows you to decide how well the pinball machine is maintained and, therefore, how accurate and true your game will be.
 Features:
 * View the 3D table from three different angles
 * Includes a full-color dot matrix display
 * Adjust options such as flipper power, table age, and more</desc>

		<desc>A combination of ice hockey, basketball, and bare-knuckle fighting, Professional Underground League of Pain is a futuristic sports game with few rules and loads of violence. The object of the game is to throw a plasma ball into a round goal that is suspended above the middle of a hockey-sized arena. Before you or your computer opponent can make a basket, the ball must be charged.
Each team's charger is located in their opponents end of the court. Be careful, though: If the ball is charged with your opponent's color and you make a basket, your opponent gets the points. The same rule applies for the opposing team. There are different zones on the court and depending on where a player is standing when he makes a shot, he will score one, two, or three points.
 There are sixteen different teams to choose from, representing the countries of England, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Russia. Each team has four players on the court at once. Most of the action consists of passing, shooting, and stealing the ball, punching and sliding into your opponents, and a whole lot of running.
 Features:
 * Lead one of 16 international teams to victory in a futuristic sport resembling basketball
 * Watch the action from a choice of camera angles, including multiple overhead views
 * Compete in league, tournament, and exhibition play</desc>

		<desc>The evil Terracom corporation has struck a deal with alien forces to eradicate populated areas on key planets. This initiative has been named Project Overkill. As one of four mercenaries hired to protect the citizens, you must destroy hordes of alien forces while getting to the root of Terracom's nefarious purposes. Choose from a demolitions expert, a genetic hybrid, an alien weapons specialist, and a special ops assassin. The action is viewed from an isometric perspective, where your objective is to destroy anything and everything that moves. Spanning over 50 levels (including hidden areas), the game will have you infiltrating research buildings, laboratories, and blood-soaked alien territories.
 The mercenaries come equipped with a large arsenal of weapons, including chain guns, mobile mines, concussion and frag grenades, laser rifles, flamethrowers, and recoilless rockets. View your surroundings with a map screen that also displays your current mission and how close you are to achieving your objectives. Solve various puzzles by finding cardkeys to unlock doors, flipping wall switches, and using retinal scanners with enemy eyes. One block of memory card data is needed to save mission progress. The M-rated Project Overkill in not for the squeamish: your kills will leave behind blood spatter on walls, mutilated corpses, and blood-soaked footprints as you walk across decimated bodies.
 Features:
 * Battle through over 50 missions from an isometric perspective
 * Master an assortment of high-powered weapons and witness the carnage in graphic detail
 * Choose from four distinct mercenaries</desc>

		<desc>Xako and Mia live for one thing and one thing only: to catch serious air performing mind-blowing stunts on their hoverdeks. A hoverdek is best described as a hovering skateboard, it works the same way but there are no wheels and it's constantly floating. Back to the story at hand, these two dekkies are fanatical about their skills; they would go adventuring with their buddies and show off new tricks.
 Would meaning past tense; dekkies are now being oppressed by the maniacal Krakken. With a sour hatred for hoverdeks, the cheese-smelling ingrate kidnaps dekkies and stores them in his mundane world. Xako and Mia are at the end of their ropes and decided that its time to destroy Krakken and rescue their fellow dekkies!
 Psybadek combines third-person 3D platforming with the trickery of a snow or skateboarding game. Spanning four unique worlds, players will overcome a series of platforming obstacles, pickup important items, and perform a barrage of death defying stunts aboard a hoverdek. Stunts include a ground-shaking SuperStomp, a 360-degree spiral, a circular back flip known as the Firewall, a near impossible spinning Powerblast, and a weather altering Elektra Storm.
 Broken into eight levels apiece (with a bonus level in each), the four worlds consist of an Ice World, a Jungle World, a Desert World, and the Underground. Level and world selection is chosen from the Psyba-Zone, which holds it all together as a hub. Each level features a unique design ranging from psychedelically rendered jungles to ancient temples.
 Krakken does not tolerate the insolent; anyone with enough guts to challenge him will be met with extreme resistance. His army consists of waddling penguins, genetically altered freaks that throw rocks and snowballs, and the ever-dangerous monkey. Fortunately, Xako and Mia are packing a few unique weapons such as the anti-matter missile, the C. King plastic explosive, and a Ballistic Bogey Bomb. They can also collect a number of stars that increase the overall score that awards the player with some extra goodies!
 Psybadek also features a few free-roaming areas and a local skate park when the going gets a little rough! So what are you waiting for? Grab your hoverdek, catch some massive air, and save your buddies from the evil Krakken!</desc>

		<desc>Psychic Detective is an innovative slant on the interactive movie. You're Eric Fox, a psychic detective who can transmit his psychic self to others, to see through their eyes and hear through their ears. That way you can find out things about the case you couldn't otherwise. He has been employed by a strange woman to discover the mystery behind the death of her father.
 The huge mystery starts with Eric meeting the beautiful young woman named Laina. She introduces you to the other members of her family. Once another character appears on screen, an icon with their face on appears on the border. Click on this icon, and Eric will be able to delve into that person?s mind. This comes in handy for getting to know who is suspicious and who is innocent. As you can guess, the game is packed full of characters, so the mystery will take a heck of a long time to finish.
 Eric is able to receive weird psychic flashbacks, which usually feature either scenes of murder, sex or just suspicious goings on. He can influence the behaviour of other characters (annoy them, seduce them, etc.). As well as people, the smallest of items can give vital clues, even a stubbed out cigarette. It all depends on how carefully you watch the screen border. Special ?Psychic Collectors? must be picked up ? these can magnify Eric?s psychic powers. When one is activated, the screen goes into a swirl of colours, and presents the player with a variety of choice s. As the game progresses, Eric gets to play the Black Diamond game. This is a psychic battle which takes place on a board, but it?s a bit strange.
 The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most people might not want to play through again.
 It?s gonna be a big mystery to solve. Heck, there are three CDs for this thing! Clues to the mystery are everywhere, and by touching certain objects Eric can reveal their history. All this is viewed from a first person perspective as Eric chats to all the other characters
 In the PSX version of the game you can save the game anywhere and at anytime except during the Black Diamond games. There are some scenes that are removed comparing to the Pc and 3do versions of the game.</desc>

He can influence the behaviour of other characters (annoy them, seduce them, etc.). As well as people, the smallest of items can give vital clues, even a stubbed out cigarette. It all depends on how carefully you watch the screen border. Special ?Psychic Collectors? must be picked up ? these can magnify Eric?s psychic powers. When one is activated, the screen goes into a swirl of colours, and presents the player with a variety of choice s. As the game progresses, Eric gets to play the Black Diamond game. This is a psychic battle which takes place on a board, but it?s a bit strange.
 The game has many different conclusions. It's a dark story though, and most people might not want to play through again.
 It?s gonna be a big mystery to solve. Heck, there are three CDs for this thing! Clues to the mystery are everywhere, and by touching certain objects Eric can reveal their history. All this is viewed from a first person perspective as Eric chats to all the other characters
 In the PSX version of the game you can save the game anywhere and at anytime except during the Black Diamond games. There are some scenes that are removed comparing to the Pc and 3do versions of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Psychic Force is a fighting arcade game created by Taito which was later ported to the PlayStation in 1996. The PlayStation version was released by Acclaim in North America, and in PAL regions.
 The game was a 3D fighter which combined the normal features of an arcade fighting game with psychic powers. There were eight characters available to choose from in the game, all deemed as 'psychic masters'. The game was released without much hype and failed to sell many copies.
 In 1999 a sequel was released under the title Psychic Force 2012 also for the arcade, and was ported for the Dreamcast console. It was adapted to the PlayStation under the title Psychic Force 2.
 Psychic Force 2 (PF2) is the Playstation version of the arcade game Psychic Force 2012 (2012) which was released also for the Sega Dreamcast

		<desc>Punky Skunk is not your ordinary skunk: he's an extreme-sports loving critter trying to save his friends from a kidnapping wolf named Badler. So begins this adventure of a hip skunk and his 30 levels of platforming action, taking him through the sky, across land, underneath the ground and over water. Multiple paths and bonus levels will offer some variety in this throwback to 2D platform games of the past.
 In order to succeed, Punky must use various moves to fight enemies, avoid traps and find the flagpole signifying the end of the level. In addition, you'll be able to collect stars and 1-ups for extra lives, green orbs to replenish health, and gear icons outfitting Punky with one of six pieces of equipment: Paraglider, Inline Skates, Skysurfer, Pogo Stick, Jetpack or Diggers. Besides using the gear, Punky can either jump or attack enemies with his "spray." Skunk got you stumped? Not to worry, you can resume progress at the start of each cleared stage if you have a memory card.
 Characters:
 - PUNKY (Kuri in Japanese): The hero of our game a skunk. He's had it with Badler, and he's going to fight back.
 - KELLY: A red bunny, She gives Punky advice as the game advances.
 - NASH: A badger gadgeteer, who for some unexplained reason always wears a flight helmet.
 - BADLER: The wolf who is threatening Punky's island with his massive amusement park.</desc>

 You can compete both against the CPU, on multiple difficulty levels, and against up to three other players.
 Features:
 - Crazy mini-golf simulation for up to four players
 - Five ways to play, including Practice and Trick modes
 - Wacky, 3D courses put putting skills to the test</desc>

		<desc>Puzzle Star Sweep is the first puzzle game in A1 Games' line of budget-oriented titles. The object of the game is to clear an area of red, yellow and blue rectangular blocks by rotating and moving them so their stars line up. Each block is the same size and contains either one or two stars. Your well is constantly being filled with blocks that rise from the bottom of the screen, and the blocks that you place yourself can be placed anywhere they will fit.
 The One-Player Mode is an endless mode where you play until the blocks reach the top of the screen. Story Mode is a series of vs. battles. In this mode, clearing multiple blocks and starting chain reactions dumps obstacles on top of your opponent's playfield. But watch out, because the same can be done to you. The gameplay in VS Mode is the same as in the Story Mode, except you compete against another human player. Attack Mode is a collection of six challenges that revolve around completing specific tasks, such as making as many chains as possible or going for a high score.
 One notable feature in Puzzle Star Sweep is the concept of "stardust," which functions as points that go toward unlocking bonus features. Stardust is earned through a variety of means, including defeating opponents in the Story Mode and earning medals in the Attack mode. ?
 Features
 * Includes four modes of play from the start: 1-player, 2-player, Story and Attack
 * Story mode features eight characters to choose from
 * Unlock Special Mode by collecting star fragments</desc>

		<desc>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.

There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)

The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<desc>Hasbro Interactive continues their series of classic Arcade game remakes with Q*bert for the PlayStation. In this disc you'll find the original game, a new Adventure mode and a special Head-To-Head contest. Those of you who misspent your youths in the Arcades will recall that the original Q*bert stars a little round orange guy with bulging eyes, a round snout for a nose, short legs and no arms or torso. Your job is to hop Q*bert around a pyramid of cubes and change the colors of the cubes to a target color. In later rounds, you will need to change the colors of the cubes more than once in order to achieve your goal. Once the entire pyramid has been changed to the target color, you advance to a new pyramid.
 While you are hopping Q*bert up and down the cubes of each pyramid, enemies, most of which are deadly to the touch, will try and stop your progress. Another way to die is to hop off of the pyramid without landing on one of the three discs that are placed above and beside the pyramid. These discs are useful when enemies, such as Coily the snake (Q*bert's archenemy), are in hot pursuit. Green enemies and objects can (and should be) be touched, and some of them cause trouble. For example, Slick and Sam wreak havoc by hopping on cubes and changing their color.

		<desc>QIX Neo is a remake of Volfied, Taito's arcade game from 1989. The graphics and sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines.

The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included, using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.</desc>

		<desc>The Raiden Project features two vertically scrolling arcade shooters on one disc: Raiden and Raiden II. Raiden takes place in 2090, a time when Earth is under attack by hordes of alien "exobiological beings, a race of technologically advanced creatures from a distant galaxy." To combat this threat, the world's top scientists, engineers and otherwise brilliant people have replicated a super high-altitude fighter/bomber from the remains of a downed alien vessel. This new ship is called Raiden (aka Lightning Thunderbolt), and you are its pilot.</desc>

		<desc>A chaotic, and bouncy rally racing game.  One of the aspects of this game that set it aside from other games at this time was the variety of the terrain.  Not only is it off-road, but the course is filled with jumps, dips, hairpins, and off camber turns.   Consequently, it is very common for the car to flip upside down.  By pressing the shoulder buttons, the player can rock the car left or right.  To get back on the tires, the user must time the rocking of the car to flip it back upright.  

Any of the course can be raced forwards or backwards, and there is a season mode as well as the single race mode.  In order to increase the chaos, there is a suicide-mode where you race the course in the opposite direction of the other cars.  Up to 4 players can play the game in split screen mode.  Tracks include a tight Stadium course, an abandoned mine, jungle, and desert.  

One trick to increase performance is that the buttons that rock the car upright, can also be used to prevent flipping in tight corners. Mud, dirt, snow, and water are kicked up behind the car to add some graphical flair.  The cars in the game are not licensed vehicles.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to the chaotic off-road rally racing game, Rally Cross.  The lead programmer, Mark Lyons, and the lead artist, Scott Atkins, from Rally Cross had left Sony and formed a new company, Idol Minds.  Rally Cross 2 was one of the first two games developed by Idol Minds. It was an attempt to build on the original, while creating a game with a simpler learning curve.  

Rally Cross 2 retains the rough terrain of the original, with even more jumps and crashes.  Multi-tap and 4 player split screen were not included in the sequel, but 2 player split screen remained.   The ability to control attributes such as suspension, tires, and steering was added, as well as the ability to paint your car with a primary and detail color that can be picked from a large palette.

Once again the courses can be raised forwards or backwards, and in suicide mode(cars racing in opposite directions at the same time).  The multi-race, season mode, still exists.  One of the biggest additions is the track editor.  There are a dozen or so different pieces that can be rotated and dropped into a 2D grid to create completely new tracks.  

The cars are still flipped upright with the shoulder buttons, but it now requires only a single button press instead of the multiple rocking motions in the original.  Handling has changed significantly since cars tend to fishtail around the corners instead of flip, but high speed crashes will still result in an upside down car.</desc>

However, Scumlabs, who has just rebuilt their facilities in Salt Lake City, causes another accident that results in three new monsters: Boris, Curtis, and Ruby. 

Players choose one of the three original monsters to rescue. The player then uses the characters in the part of the world where the rescuee is held. They work as a collective to break buildings, eat people, and destroy cars and this creates competition among players. 

When a player frees George, Lizzie, or Ralph, then they become playable characters.</desc>

		<desc>Rayman 2: The Great Escape is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubi Soft Montpellier.

Rayman 2 takes place in a world called the Glade of Dreams, and revolves around its invasion and occupation by an armada of interstellar Robo-Pirates, led by Admiral Razorbeard. Prior to the invasion, the Robo-Pirates destroyed over one hundred planets in the galaxy, with the intention of enslaving their inhabitants. Upon the invasion of the Glade of Dreams, the Robo-Pirates were battled against by Rayman, Globox, and other allies. After some battles, Rayman's capture occurs after the explosion of the Primordial Core. Ly the Fairy telepathically communicates with Rayman explaining the consequences of the damage, with the core's shattering into 1000 Yellow Lums, and the capture of many fighters. Rayman's powers are also lost due to this, and he finds himself captured by the Robo-Pirates at the beginning of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Rayman Rush is a character-based racing game similar to other foot-racing titles such as Micro Maniacs or the Xbox' Mad Dash Racing. A selection of seven playable characters from the Rayman universe race to the finish line, overcoming obstacles and collecting power-ups along the way.
 Rayman Rush is a on-foot racing game developed and published by Ubisoft, based on the Rayman universe. In many ways, it is like half of a port of Rayman Arena, featuring conversions of the same race tracks, the same introduction movie and also character theme songs (it, however, lacks the battles from M, and the character roster is different). It is a 1-2 player game, and each race has 2 characters running (1 in certain game modes). The game was released 4 months after Rayman M/Arena.
 Races take place on 12 tracks in four worlds and there are five main modes of play: Training, Championship, Time Attack, Lum, and Target. Some of the modes of play in Rayman Rush concern more combative contests, as opposed to straightforward racing. Success allows players to unlock new characters and play modes. Two Rayman Rush players can race head-to-head, split-screen style.

You skate around 3 large areas and attempt to perform wild tricks, collect scooter wheels, and earn bonus time. By completing an objective on all 3 areas, you unlock a sky fortress level in which you can rescue a new skater to control.

Gameplay is based heavily on the Tony Hawk series of games. Tricks consist of button and direction presses, and can be strung together with grinds to create high-scoring combos.</desc>

Combining speed with elements from the previous title, players take their scooters and hit one of three locales in an attempt to become a racing legend. Each location (city streets, mall, and an industrial compound) is composed of three separate sections.

In the first round, players qualify for the race by completing three laps within the allotted time. Next, players race by challenging two other opponents in a three-lap challenge. Completing these two objectives will open up the area's skatepark, and by beating the park's overall score, a new member will be added to the racing team.</desc>

			 Missions steadily increase in difficulty, and several hidden missions can be unlocked for play. RC Helicopter flight engine is based on flight dynamics for small craft, and the PlayStation's analog controller attempts to replicate the remote-controlling experience.</desc>

		<desc>R/C Stunt Copter is a highly realistic simulation of flying a miniature R/C Helicopter that, due to being developed by Shiny Entertainment (the mad men behind MDK and Earthworm Jim),  has a much bigger sense of humor than is necessary for a game of it's genre...

The following text  is quoted directly from this game's actual manual!

"Let me make something perfectly clear: You will NEVER beat this game. I think that's important enough for repeating: You will NEVER beat this game.
I will wait a second while the ramifications of that sink in.
Now, I know you're sayiong one of these things right now:
a) I can beat any game.
b) Why the heck would I play a game I can never win?
c) Whatchu talkin' 'bout Willis?"

That text alone should give you a taste of what you're in for...</desc>

		<desc>Less than a year after the original game was released, a sequel was released also for the PlayStation and DOS entitled Re-Loaded, developed and published by the same companies. It featured the same game engine, and even the game menus are the same, although it is a game engine with slightly improved graphics. Four characters from the original game are also in Re-Loaded, such as Mamma, Bounca, Butch, and Cap'n Hands. Vox, however, is not present in the game and is replaced by two new female characters: a pink-haired, cannibalistic sex symbol named The Consumer, and a malfunctioning android nun named Sister Magpie. Via cheat code, Sister Magpie can unlock hidden character Fwank from the previous game for use in Re-Loaded. If unlocked, Fwank is the best character in Re-Loaded, with the most speed and best armour. All of the returning characters have new weapons and/or variations of their costumes. There are twelve blood-soaked new worlds to annihilate, much bigger than the levels encountered in the previous game, and with the added bonus of being able to morph the surrounding terrain with high-powered weaponry and explosives.</desc>

		<desc>For years, the Toy-Volt company has been producing toys and games for children all over the world. Within months of introducing their first products, Toy-Volt shot to the top! No one could put their finger on exactly what it was that made the toys so popular. Sure, they employed the best designers and marketers in the world, but there was something else about Toy-Volt toys, something almost.... magic. Now, their newest R/C cars really start to live! 

Re-Volt is a racing game where you take control over one of more than 28 R/C cars and drive on one of the 13 tracks. The tracks are varied, and include a toy shop, a supermarket, a luxury liner and more. It is possible to play a "reversed" (backwards) or "mirror" (reversed left and right) variety of each track. There are also 4 levels of realism to choose from. 

There are a couple of single- and multiplayer game modes to choose from. There's a Single Race, where you complete a single track while competing with several computer-controlled opponents; a Championship, where you try to complete a series of races in hopes of finishing on the top; and Multiplayer, where you play with live opponents. There's also a Time Trial, where you're alone on the track, and simply try to get as best a time as possible; a Practice mode, where you're free to drive around a track to learn its structure and shortcuts; and the Stunt Arena, where you drive around a special arena and try to collect stars situated in hard-to-reach places. 

In Single Race, Championship and Multiplayer there are power-ups scattered throughout the track; picking them up gives you a one-use random power, such as missiles to launch at pesky opponents, a star to temporarily freeze competitors in place or a lightning bolt, which makes your car shock opponents nearby to make them stop.</desc>

		<desc>Gameplay in the game is similar to that of the previous game. The more big hits the player land consecutively, letters that spell out "RUMBLE" appear below the player's side of the screen. Letters also appear when the fighter taunts his opponent. Once the word is formed, powerful combo attacks can be activated that will almost definitely knock the opponent down. This time, however, there are three levels of "RUMBLE", which build up one after the other. If the player successfully lands a combo with his RUMBLE Meter full on the third level (where the letters start smoking), the final blow can launch the opponent clear out of the ring, giving the player an instant victory.</desc>

		<desc>Red Asphalt incorporates both racing elements and combat. Using a skillful combination of both, your objective is to overcome your opponents and face off against Draenek in the Arena of Death -- the fifth and final world. There are 24 tracks in all, spanning apocalyptic city streets and other futuristic settings.

Before your dangerous journey begins, you'll need to choose one of six different characters to play as. Each comes with three varying abilities; the driving skill affects a character's handling ability and top speed, tactical affects weapon lock-on times and aggression is that character's strength. Among the characters is the dangerous Motormouth that thrives on death and annihilation; Thula Crimstone, a future leader of the Starian Empire; Jackal, a war-torn being that wishes to destroy all those that bring war against his people; and the spiritual Hiroki. Throughout the game, they'll earn experience points that increase ability points.</desc>

Strategy comes in choosing the right lure for the circumstance and it takes skill to hook the big ones and reel them in successfully. Underwater shots and "fish-eye" views of the lure offer a perspective on the sport that few ever see on an actual outing. Players can even take a "picture" of their prize catch before releasing it back into the virtual wild.
 Features:
 * Catch a variety of fish that inhabit lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams
 * Keep your catches in your virtual fish tank
 * Unlock new and more challenging fishing spots as the game progresses</desc>

Gameplay modes available include 2 player vs gameplay, the mission-based tournament which has over 40 races that take place in 6 tracks, and have different objectives such as jump over a certain number of obstacles, win in a certain time bracket, etc.as well as the time-honored "battle" races we have come to expect from Kart racers with all manner of power-ups and wacky weapons.

Vehicles are all hovercrafts, so the control is the same no mather if you race on ice, grass, etc. and graphics-wise the game uses Direct 3D accelerated polygonal graphics .</desc>

		<desc>In Resident Evil, you play the role of either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine. Your choice of will determine various events and the flow of the storyline. After choosing your character you begin to explore the house, which is filled with all sorts of nasty creatures -- mainly zombies -- and some devious puzzles. Puzzles may involve putting a certain item in its right place, unlocking doors, and pushing statues. Each puzzle you solve brings you closer to unraveling the mystery behind the house and the Umbrella corporation.
 Among the various things you will find throughout the mansion are item boxes. Because your character can only hold a certain number of items (Chris can hold up to six items and Jill can hold eight), you will need to safely store objects you don't have room to carry. You will also come across stones that need to be placed in their corresponding cubbyholes, health and herb medication, diaries of lab technicians, weapons, and keys.
 In addition to a map and radio system, you are provided with a small arsenal of weaponry. The default weapon is a melee knife but as you progress through the game, you will also come across a 9mm handgun, a shotgun, a magnum, and explosive acid and fire rounds. But will this be enough? Can you solve the mystery of Resident Evil before its too late, or will you "disappear" like Bravo Team?</desc>

		<desc>Resident Evil Survivor is a spin-off of Capcom's survival horror series. Instead of giving players control of characters from a third-person perspective as in previous games, Resident Evil Survivor takes place from a first-person viewpoint. Originally conceived as a light-gun game (Capcom opted to take this feature out of the U.S. release, citing heightened tension over gun violence), it essentially plays like one. Players may rotate their view and move up and down hallways, but when the zombies come slouching, it will be time to let loose a hail of bullets to bring them down.
 Although the plot of Resident Evil Survivor is a side-story, it still refers to the events of other Resident Evil games. Raccoon City, the now-famous American suburb gripped by an industrial plague that turned its citizens into zombies, is gone, blown completely off of the map in order to keep the dreaded virus from spreading. Unfortunately, Umbrella, the wicked corporation that created the deadly outbreak, hasn't stopped spreading its own dark research. The company has victimized another small town, and apparently in a desperate attempt to flee the carnage, a helicopter has crashed. In this chopper is a man who cannot remember who he is or what he was doing prior to the crash. He is armed with only a handgun, and ahead of him he has a task that none would envy -- to escape this nightmare town crawling with zombies and other foul creatures, and discover who he is.
 Items, weapons, and enemies have all been borrowed from the main series, as has the jumpy, tense atmosphere, the strange dialogue, and the series' trademark eerie music. The only noticeable thing missing from Survivor are the puzzles found in the other Resident Evil titles. This game is about action, through and through.</desc>

There are are two ways to win, the easier one would be to capture the enemy's flag by bringing it to your bunker with the frail Jeep. This is the main objective. The other way to win is to destroy your enemy, a secondary objective.</desc>

		<desc>Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure is a tactical role-playing game for the PlayStation from Atlus USA and Nippon Ichi Software, the creators of Disgaea, and is part of the Marl Kingdom series. Rhapsody, along with its sequels, are considered musical RPGs, meaning in place of FMV cutscenes, there are musical numbers, complete with vocals. The game is also known for its "overwhelming cuteness" and low level of difficulty. Although this may make the game seem geared towards a younger audience, in Japan, the game and series in general has seen much success.

Choose from 4 fantasy cars (plus 9 more that you must unlock yourself) and go race in a series of equally fantastical tracks against a series of computer controlled oponents as well as the clock itself.

Other additions to the game come in the form of a hidden "extra" mode, and a music player that allows you to play any of the 6 included cd tracks as well as your own music cds.</desc>

		<desc>When Rise of the Robots was released for the Super Nintendo in 1994, it didn't take long to discover that slick packaging, streamlined graphics, and rocking sounds were but a thin veil over a clunky, slow, and exceedingly dull game. Rise 2 Resurrection for the Sony PlayStation, the sequel to Rise of the Robots, improves upon the original game's positive aspects and fixes some of its problems.
 Once again the music is written and performed by former Queen band member Brian May, and once again it rocks hard, this time with the benefit of CD technology. The graphics are an improvement over its handsome predecessor, and the sound effects are vibrant and explosive. While these aesthetic improvements are to be expected, the things that are the same in Rise 2 Resurrection from the first Rise of the Robots is the gameplay.
 There are 18 different darkly futuristic fighters, a slew of combos, several gruesome termination moves, and plenty of combat techniques. It's certainly not very original, but it is fun. The controls are responsive, and the fights are furious and thoroughly convincing. When you pull off a multiple-hit combo and robotic metal clangs against robotic metal, it's enough to make your teeth rattle.</desc>

		<desc>Rising Zan is a 3rd person action game with plenty of oddball humor and interesting situations. Zan, the main character wields the weapons of both of his trades... the Sword of a Samurai master, and the six-shooter pistol of an American cowboy. He'll need a variety of techniques to defeat the Jackal Clan and avenge his own lost battle. Zan proceeds through enemies and challenges in each level to eventually reach the boss who he then battles in some form of specialized combat or pattern. Once the boss is defeated, Zan gets the chance to unleash as much punishment on his foe in 30 seconds as he can; higher damage values will change the finishing move he uses to slay his foe.</desc>

		<desc>Aspects of the classic game, like building armies and seizing territories, are brought to life through animation and graphics. The version also offers a variation on the classic game, titled Ultimate Risk, which further enhances gameplay by including weather, terrain, POWs, and more, features not possible with the limitations of the board version. These features add a new dynamic to the already challenging game by forcing users to consider alternate strategies from the original board game version.
 Five maps are available for strategizing, including the classic world map with six continents and the American map, with 14 additional countries and 153 territories. If playing the classic version, players choose from three varying game objectives. In World Domination, the last player standing wins the game, while the Capital Risk module establishes a goal of conquering the opposing player's secretly designated capital. The last objective, Mission Risk, involves completing a mission designated by drawing a random card.
 In addition to the three objectives, the territorial option is available in Ultimate Risk. The object here is to attain an empire of a predetermined size quicker than your opponents, who can be either computer-controlled or human.</desc>

		<desc>Electronic Arts' motorcycle racing series makes its PlayStation debut with digitized graphics, a licensed soundtrack, and full-motion video cut-scenes. The fourth entry in the franchise continues the point-to-point racing format of the Genesis games, with players knocking out rivals with fists, boots, or even pilfered weapons. Two play options are available to rambunctious riders: Thrash Mode and Big Game Mode. The former lets players enter a single race on their choice of courses and difficulty levels, while the latter is structured like a career. Big Game Mode involves selecting one of eight colorful characters and competing in a total of 25 races on five Californian courses: Sierra Nevada, Napa Valley, Peninsula, The City, and Pacific Highway.</desc>

		<desc>Road Rash 3-D is a 3D installment of the motorcycle racing game in which participants utilize violent tactics to win. The gameplay is quite similar to that of the previous games: the player-controlled racer must avoid oncoming cars and obstacles on the road, beating opponents with metal pipes, crowbars, and other assorted damage-inflicting tools. The player wins money upon the completion of the race, and eventually can afford to buy better bikes. The courses are formed from connecting points in an environmental grid, which means that the player can utilize different stretches of courses to advance.</desc>

		<desc>Titus returns to the racing games that they started in Commodore Amiga with the Crazy Cars game series (the first one was released in 1987 and the third and last one in 1992) with Roadsters that features the same great gameplay with enhanced 3d graphics.
 Ever feel like betting on yourself in a high-speed race? Well Roadsters gives you that opportunity. In a racing game featuring ten tracks with thirty different cars, Titus has made a game where being the best driver does not necessarily ensure success. You also need the cash flow!</desc>

		<desc>Robo-Pit 2 is, like its predecessor, a fighting game where robots battle it out in an arena. The game starts with the player creating his own robot. The player can use 146 different parts and 72 colours to create a robot of his own taste. The different body parts that can be customized are head, body, arms and legs. Each body part has its own attack and durability ratings that determines how the robot will fare in combat. 

The battles takes place in the Coliseum. The Coliseum consists of a number of rooms each hosting an enemy robot that the player has to defeat to unlock more rooms. Defeating an enemy can also grant the player new body parts as well as experience and skill points. The player can move around his robot from a third person perspective and launch different attacks such as jabs, straight, hook and upper attacks. With good timing it's also possible to link attacks together. A special attack can be executed when the SP gauge is full. There's also a guard impact command which allows the player to repel the enemy attack. The player has a booster which allows the robot to fly as long as the boost gauge lasts. A battle ends when one of the combatants has his energy reduced to zero.</desc>

		<desc>In a world destroyed by pollution, nuclear war and poverty, vacationers have become hot property. They feel the need to escape from their everyday existence and go on vacations! Big Daddy is the vacation king at the moment, and he's provided some really fabulous getaways for these people. But who's going to get paid for taking the vacationers to luxurious landmarks and resorts? Well, you are!

The "not-right" folks at Singletrac are at it again with Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012, the "spiritual successor" to Twisted Metal 2. In it, you chose one of 16 wacky, down-right sick "automercenaries" and compete with your enemies to pick up the tourists and take them to photo-ops. Doing this gets you lots of money, which can be used buy weapon upgrades and health. But your enemies really don't want you to have the money -- and they shoot back.</desc>

		<desc>Rollcage is an arcade-style racing game for Windows and PlayStation, developed by Attention to Detail, and published by Psygnosis. The Windows version was released in the UK on March 24, 1999. The game's selling point was its unique physics engine, in which cars could drive on walls or ceilings because of the airflow passing over them at extreme speeds. The game also featured an original soundtrack by Fatboy Slim.
 Ever felt the need to round a corner going 300MPH while grinding your opponents into a wall or the side of a building? If you answered yes, Psygnosis' futuristic auto-combat/racing title Rollcage may be the game for you!
 Taking a cue from the company's other futuristic racer Wipeout, Rollcage features twenty distinctive tracks through four different environments including red canyons, cities, and scenic roadways. The difference between the two games, however, is that the six included vehicles can race on any surface found within the track. Players can drive their vehicle on tunnel ceilings, up on massive boulders, the sides of walls, and other various surfaces!</desc>

It is the sequel to Rollcage and was released in 2000. On top of the basic racing concept, the cars can be equipped with weapons, which are picked up on the track as bonuses, which can be used against competing cars. The automobiles themselves, once again, have wheels that are larger than the body of the car thus creating a car that has no up or down and therefore can be flipped yet continue to drive.</desc>

		<desc>Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends was an animated program, that originally aired in 1999 as part of BKN, the syndicated's cartoon programing block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.

On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race.</desc>

There's a wide variety of speed-ups and power-ups out there, and you'll need them to get faster, bigger, or more powerful. Who needs combat cars when you can race jungle animals?</desc>

The story behind the game is yet another one of post-apocalyptic chaos. In the S.C.A.R.S. universe mankind has lost control of the earth and has been superseded by nine supercomputers. After developing all human emotions, the supercomputers became bored with their existence and decided to pass the time with â€œthe most honorable of human customsâ€: racing (so much for space exploration). Turning to nature for inspiration, the computers based their new land vehicles on some of earthâ€™s most fearsome creatures. They called their new racing league the Super Computer Animal Racing Simulation.</desc>

		<desc>Pinball, a game that has been around since the 1930s, has been translated into video game format once again, this time via the Mighty Morphing Power Rangers, those multi-colored ninja heroes of low-budget television. Composed of 5 different 3D play fields, this one-player simulation takes place in fifteen locations around the world, including Japan, New York, and Africa.
			Each play field consists of the usual pinball trappings such as ramps, targets, flippers, bumpers, and multi-ball specials. Before and between each level of play, a cinematic storyline plays out involving the invasion of Earth by aliens and the Power Ranger's attempts at stopping this dreaded scourge. Along with the Rangers, several other characters from this juggernaut franchise are featured including: Zeo Zords, King Mondo, and Queen Madrina.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to  Saga Frontier, but also to the less known SNES  Romancing SaGa series, "Saga Frontier 2" allows you to play the stories of two main characters - a young prince Gustave XIII, who has been exiled from his homeland because he was unable to use the mysterious power of Anima and to become a worthy successor to the throne, and William Knights, a treasure hunter, who strives to find ancient artefacts containing great powers. Their stories are connected to each other, and each story occupies almost a lifetime: the characters grow up and die, new characters are born, etc. 

"Saga Frontier 2" continues the non-linear gameplay traditions of the SaGa series. You can visit all towns at your wish and at any time, recruit anyone to your party, and freely upgrade your party members by gaining new abilities and distributing them among your characters. You can learn magic spells by collecting artefacts, and combining them to produce more powerful types of magic. Similar to Konami's  Suikoden series, there are three types of combat: one-on-one (duel), turn-based party combat, and strategic army battles.</desc>

Now 12 mighty warriors search for the crazed Zankuro, each with their own agenda and reason for wanting to kill him. Most are in it for revenge of a loved one killed by Zankuro's sword, some are greedy for his demonic power, and others want to save him and turn him to the good side of nature.</desc>

		<desc>San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing for the PlayStation is based on the 1996 hit arcade game by Atari Games. Players will race through locations based on San Francisco cities, rural areas, and suburban neighborhoods. Environments can also be cycled through day, night, and snow conditions in order to add some variety and challenge to the racing action.

Players can alter their view of their car from a third-person perspective to a first-person view looking through the windshield. There are eight available cars to choose from that vary in speed and control as well as four difficulty levels (Beginner, Advanced, Expert, and Extreme). The higher the difficulty, the more control is sacrificed in order to increase the maximum speed. Car colors can also be customized to your liking, and there is a choice between manual and automatic gear transmissions.</desc>

		<desc>Hasbro Interactive's best-selling computer title based on one of the world's most famous word games has made the translation to the PlayStation with real-time 3D graphics and support for up to four players. As with the two previous CD-ROM games, Scrabble for the PlayStation even contains the Merriam Webster's Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, 3rd Edition, so players can look up definitions to certain words (not all are available, however) and determine if a word actually exists.

For those unfamiliar with the board game from which this title is based, Scrabble involves forming words using wooden tiles representing individual letters. These tiles are then placed into rows on a board made up of 225 spaces. Each letter is worth a certain point value, and some of the spaces will offer specific bonuses if you manage to build off them. The player with the most points after all the tiles have been placed on the board is considered the winner. The PlayStation version follows this same format, but with automatic scoring and a computer opponent named Maven with eight selectable difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>Sentient is a first-person adventure developed by Psygnosis and released on the PlayStation in 1997. It was also released for the PC the same year.
 You are sent to investigate an outbreak of radiation sickness aboard the space station Icarus, but once aboard, you realize your primary objective is the least of your worries. The captain has been murdered, an assassin threatens a visiting senior Senator, and a power struggle arises as the station careens toward the sun. Save yourself, or save the ship?
 Sentient's main feature is the artificial intelligence controlling multiple individual crew members aboard the station, each with their own assignments and behaviors. You interact with the AI characters through an elaborate parser interface, which allows you to ask them everything from the location of a vital piece of equipment, to their opinion of another member of the crew. To succeed, you must take advantage of the crew's help through this social system.
 Through interaction with more than 60 characters and exploration of 200 real-time rendered locations you need to try and save the ship, and yourself. The game automatically randomizes sub-plots so that it will be different every time you play.
 Sentient requires 6 memory blocks for one saved game.</desc>

		<desc>Enter a surreal world where you must battle the Sentinel and his sentries over 650 chequered, 3D landscapes.  Energy and movement are completely redefined in this unique blend of arcade and strategy elements. You, only known as an intelligent presence, move about the landscape by teleporting between robot "hulls".  Any object in your field of vision can be absorbed for energy, as long as you also see the square of the landscape that the object is standing on.  By aiming at any square your can see, and spending energy, you can create a new robot hull and teleport your presence to it, or you can create neutral objects: trees to block yourself from the Sentinel's gaze, or boulders that can be stacked.  You gain height in the landscape by creating a robot on top of a stack of boulders, until you can see the Sentinel's square at the highest point in the landscape and absorb him.  The problem is that the Sentinel slowly rotates and ruthlessly absorbs anything in his field of vision that is more potent than a tree, including yourself.  In later levels, his sentries will threaten you with absorption from several directions.</desc>

		<desc>Sesame Street: Elmo's Letter Adventure is an educational 3D action-adventure that is designed to help children ages three to six with letter recognition and basic spelling skills. This game is brought to you by Children's Television Workshop, the same company responsible for the PBS television series Sesame Street. It was released almost simultaneously with Sesame Street: Elmo's Number Journey, also for the PlayStation.
 In Sesame Street: Elmo's Letter Adventure you assume the role of the adorable red Muppet Elmo as you journey and explore three different fantasy worlds. These worlds are Big Bird's Farm, Grover in Outer Space and Ernie's Underwater World. You will begin your adventure on Sesame Street, where you will meet Sesame Street characters who invite you to visit their fantasy worlds to search for letters and play games. Before you leave Sesame Street you can interact with the characters around you as well as visit Elmo's Room, where you can practice playing the game. While in Elmo's Room you can also view the game's credits and watch preview videos from Sony Wonder (by pressing the "down" directional button).
 Each of the three fantasy worlds you will travel to consist of two different game environments and a bonus world. Once you have acquired the correct number of letters required to pass through each fantasy world you will be instantly transported to the bonus world where you will be challenged to solve word puzzles.
 Throughout the game you will receive both verbal guidance from Sesame Street characters as well as the guidance of a special onscreen controller that will prompt you on what buttons on the controller need to be used.
 Sesame Street: Elmo's Letter Adventure does not require the use of a memory card. The game's three levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium and Hard) can be accessed and changed at any time while playing.</desc>

		<desc>Specifically aimed at younger children, Sesame Street Sports focuses on good sportsmanship and having fun over any sort of competition. Although its six events are called "races," there are no opponents to battle.
			Rather, players compete against themselves, trying to finish each track while running over icons placed around each stage. There aren't any losers in this game, and players will be praised players no matter how they finish.
 The events include unicycle riding, bathtub boating, sledding and inline skating. The game is filled with Sesame Street favorites, such as Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Elmo, and Ernie, and the interface has been made as simple as possible. Each event comes with a spoken tutorial and there are three difficulty levels that affect the number of obstacles on the course.
 Features:
6 sporting events, each featuring different "Sesame Street" character
Steer Grover on his unicycle, shoot rapids with Ernie in his bathtub, race with Zoe on her Big Wheel, and more
Verbal tutorial instructs kids on how to play
Big Bird gives "Up Close and Personal" interview with each contestant
Produced for young children</desc>

		<desc>Something is going wrong in the land of Arkose: cities destroy themselves, monsters attack innocent citizens, diseases spread among the people. A giant blast has destroyed a whole town, only a young guy named Stinger narrowly escaped death. Stinger engages himself on a quest to avenge his hometown's destruction. On his journey he meets the beautiful elven girl Windleaf and the robot Harv-5, who help him to reach his ultimate goal.

Although it all seems like a typical Japanese RPG, it is not. Shadow Madness was developed and produced in the USA, although, beyond any doubt, the Final Fantasy series has been the main source of inspiration here. The battles are random, like in many Japanese RPGs, and the battle system is almost the same like in Final Fantasy games: menu-based, with several sub-menu choices. The graphics are in 3D with polygonal characters in anime/manga style (what some people call "deformed").</desc>

		<desc>Shanghai: True Valor is a 3D puzzler based on the classic Oriental games Mah Jong and Shanghai. Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding "free" tiles of the same type.

For instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining.</desc>

		<desc>Sheep is a combination strategy and puzzle game, featuring light elements of war or battle simulations, built around a wacky story in which space-faring alien explorers from millennia ago devolve into domesticated sheep on Earth. Now their ancestors are trying to round them up by secretly enlisting the aid of two humans (Bo Peep and Adam Half Pint) and two animals (a sheepdog and a pet) through subliminal mind control.
 Players take the role of the Earthly "herders" to lead the flocks through six worlds with multiple levels, eventually reaching special rendezvous point where they'll be loaded onto UFOs for the trip back to their home world of Ovis Aries. No direct control is exerted on the sheep so players must manipulate objects and obstacles, as well as rely on the strengths of each herder, to accomplish the tasks. Levels have time limits and a minimum number of sheep to be saved from each flock.
 Four breeds of sheep, each with distinctive characteristics, must be herded through all levels. Modern Pastoral are intimidated domesticated sheep, Modern Factorals are fashion-minded sheep too dumb to discern danger from safety, Long Wools are a sub-culture breed that love rock music, and Neo Genetics embrace new technology. Other features include three difficulty settings, bonus games for collecting all special "Golden Sheep" within each world, and two-player action.
 Features
 * "Artificial stupidity" AI reflects levels of sheep dumbness
 * Six worlds with multiple levels; four breeds of sheep
 * Use indirect herding techniques to lead sheep to safety
 * Two-player capability and bonus levels</desc>

		<desc>Da Wardenz, an anti-terrorist tank force, is called in whenever there is trouble somewhere in the world. You are a rookie hired by the tank force and must prove yourself in 25 increasingly difficult missions.

'The Pen' is Da Wardenz' headquarters. It has all sorts of locations including the main hangar, basketball court, simulation room, workshop area, briefing room and various lockers (used for loading and saving missions). Before a mission, you can explore the headquarters and interact with each member of the team; you may learn something.

When you start a mission, the action is viewed from a first-person perspective. It has you controlling the M-13 Predator, a highly sophisticated and upgradable tank. The game is arcade-oriented and has much more in common with 'Quarantine' and 'Doom' than serious counterparts like 'M1 Tank Platoon'.
Your tank has unlimited bullets, can sustain heavy damage and can destroy enemies but also trees and buildings.

When a mission is successfully completed you earn cash which you can spend on repairing your tank and extra upgrades.</desc>

		<desc>Silent Hill is a 1999 survival horror video game for the PlayStation. The first in a series about a mysterious town of the same name, Silent Hill generated a direct sequel, three indirect sequels, a prequel and a film adaptation. The game was included in Sony's Greatest Hits and Platinum Range of budget titles as a result of strong sales. A reinterpretation of the game was developed for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.
The plot focuses on Harry Mason as he searches for his daughter, Cheryl, who has disappeared following a car accident which left Harry unconscious. He finds Silent Hill to be largely abandoned, shrouded in a thick fog, snowing out of season, filled with monsters and being over taken by a hellish otherworld. As Harry scours the town, he begins learning about the history of Silent Hill and stumbles upon a cult ritual undertaken to bring a god to Earth.</desc>

		<desc>SilverLoad is the title of a graphic adventure video game produced by Vic Tokai in 1996. In this single-player game, you control, via a first person perspective, a Wild West cowboy as he ventures into a haunted town in order to save two children that were taken from their parents.

The U.S. based Entertainment Software Ratings Board gave the game a "M" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release.

As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in SilverLoad involves finding and interacting with various "hot spots" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order. Otherwise, you have to restart the game from the beginning, or from wherever you saved the game.</desc>

		<desc>SimCity 2000 is the successor to the ground breaking city simulation game Sim City. You are once again the mayor, but this time you can fully customize the terrain before building your city. The graphics are isometric, whereas the original had graphics displayed in a top-down fashion.

This title adds numerous features over the original such as the ability of building "light" zones, subways, hospitals, colleges, zoos, and arcos which are actually cities in cities. You can now give names to places, and your city is surrounded by neighboring towns with which you can make trade. Finally, instead of the poll in the first game you now have the option of reading several newspapers to get an idea of your progress.</desc>

Your objective is to pilot a rocket-mounted pile driver called a Slamjet while shooting, blasting, smashing and jumping anything and everything you see throughout four dangerous regions. Derived from your subconscious, the regions contain four heavily guarded Orb-Ids needed for level progression. Once obtained, you'll then take the orbs to a central location within that level. You must employ a different strategy for each orb you wish to obtain.</desc>

It has fourteen levels of single-player action some featuring the Gorgonite Archer, others featuring the commando Chip Hazard. You assume the role of Archer, who has to defend his world against an invasion of the commandos. You can run, jump, climb ledges and fight using a blaster. Many levels involve freeing captured Gorgonites who then help you fight. Multiplayer includes two head-to-head two-player Chip vs. Archer mode where you either need to capture flags or get a set amount of frags.</desc>

		<desc>As Smurf village is blessed with the arrival of a newborn baby, Gargamel casts a spell to summon an army of little servants for revenge. The brainless little creatures were then ordered to capture Baby Smurf and nine other Smurfs. Now it's up to Hefty Smurf to embark on a great adventure and save his friends!
 The Smurfs is composed of two game playing modes: "It's a Piece of Cake" and "It's No Picnic." The former is made up of six areas (The Forest, A Ski Run, Mole Race, The Mine, Iceland and The Haunted Castle) in which you must gather rattles and baby bottles for young Baby Smurf. You'll also be able to interact with the surroundings at selected points. Talk with Smurfette, pet a cute rabbit, and throw an exploding package at Brainy Smurf, but remember to stop between each level and feed Baby Smurf (your virtual pet). It's No Picnic has you guiding Hefty through 10 levels as you try to rescue all nine Smurfs before confronting Gargamel.
 Watch out for hazardous spikes, pitfalls, and falling rocks while you avoid Gargamel's servants, bees, bats and other creatures. You can also gain secret fighting and jumping skills by defeating special characters. Collect 100 coins, candy canes, or other objects in the level to gain an extra life, and utilize flowers that swallow you whole and mushrooms to gain access to higher areas. Each level in "It's No Picnic" is based upon the six areas of "It's a Piece of Cake," but with a few surprises.
 Just when you thought life was grand in Smurf village, Gargamel appears with another devious plan. Hefty is just one Smurf and needs you to help him return Baby Smurf to Smurf village before Gargamel has time to wreak any more havoc!</desc>

There are three different characters that can be played as, each with their own weapon and fighting style. Various magic scrolls can be found by defeating enemies which allow the player to cast several different types of spells including lightning and fire.

The story itself concerns an evil being who sets out looking for a Power Stone and cuts down all in his path with his sword, the Sol Divide. It is up to you to stop him, battling your way through several stages in both Arcade and Original Mode (which contain different areas and require different tactics to beat, the Original Mode being designed as a more difficult experience for players who want to progress on to a higher challenge).

Defeating enemies rewards the player with different items to help them on their journey, including the aforementioned magic scrolls, healing potions, magic bottles (only when playing Arcade Mode) and protection accessories (if playing Original Mode).</desc>

		<desc>As in the classic arcade title Breakout, Sorcerer's Maze presents players with a series of increasingly difficult stages, each of which must be cleared by destroying a variety of colored bricks found within. Players are equipped with a small paddle, capable only of horizontal movement, which they maneuver so as to deflect a tiny ball around the screen -- the ball will destroy any brick it contacts, while continuing to ricochet.
			 Failing to keep the ball in play will result in the loss of a life -- lose three and the game is over. Destroying certain bricks will result in power-ups being dropped into play, which will alter such variables as the size of the paddle and the number of balls onscreen at any one time, to name but two. Power-ups can also be purchased between stages in order to better equip oneself for precarious situations that may lie ahead.
 The game comprises more than 100 stages in all, with every ten stages grouped into a "world" based upon a specific theme. At the conclusion of each world, players will face off against a boss creature that must be dispatched in order to continue. Sorcerer's Maze supports both two-player cooperative and competitive play, the former allowing two players to assist each other in clearing each stage, and the latter involving a race to see which player can clear the stage first.</desc>

		<desc>In the 16th century, a sword surfaces that is so powerful, so evil that warriors from all over the globe seek it out. It is Soul Edge, a demon blade. From America to Europe to Japan, these warriors fight each other for the chance to obtain it. Soul Blade is a 3D weapons fighting game that chronicles their story.

A complete 3D fighting game that allows for side steps, Soul Blade has twelve colorful fighters (ten standard, two hidden, plus additional costumes for a few fighters), each with various weapons and styles. The first ten can be used in all the combat modes, while the hidden two can only be used in versus and arcade mode.

Namco enhanced the arcade version (called Soul Edge) by adding a well done CGI intro, plus a story mode to the addition of the traditional team, survival, and time attack modes. The story mode goes into greater detail about each character, and is presented in an ancient book format. The story mode also allows you to unlock more of each characters' extra weapons. These weapons, which vary in lengths, stats, and durability, add to the options available players in the versus mode.

Soul Blade's sequel is SoulCalibur, both in the arcades and for the Sega Dreamcast</desc>

The game's combat system is quite detailed, and might take a while to get used to. However, when mastered, it is relatively easy for Lin and Kotaro to dispatch multiple enemies quickly from different directions, while simultaneously avoiding the enemies thrusts and swipes. There is a single attack button, but combined with different directional buttons pressed in different combinations and held down for various intervals. There are different attack speeds which correlate to the weight of the equipped weapon, and this is displayed on the sword's 'check' window (also displayed is the sword's length and sharpness, and a brief description of the blade).</desc>

		<desc>Assume the roles of your four favorite foul-mouthed third-graders -- Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman -- as they attempt to save their small Colorado town from the side effects of an evil meteor that has landed nearby.
 Through five stages of first-person shooter action (each with three or four sub-levels), prepare to face the likes of malevolent turkeys, snowball-throwing clones, ruthless cows, aliens from another world, killer robots and toys gone bad. In most cases, you'll also have to defeat larger versions of these baddies called "tanks," which not only present the greatest danger to South Park and must be stopped before reaching town, but also generate more small enemies until they are destroyed. The end of each stage features a battle with an extremely powerful boss character.</desc>

		<desc>Chef hosts this Acclaim title, which mixes South Park trivia with mini games in the mold of Mario Party (Nintendo 64). The idea is you choose your favourite South Park kid (Kyle, Kenny, Stan or Cartman) and answer the questions based on episodes from the cartoon series. If you get it right, you then spin the wheel, and you either get the cash, lose it all, or play a mini game (either by yourself, against the AI, or against your friends if you're in multiplayer mode). The person who has the highest score (or the most correct answers) after a chosen amount of rounds wins.</desc>

Your character's vehicle may be a little cart, trike, or box, for example. Weapons include rockets, Salty Balls, Cheesy Poofs, the beloved Cow and even an Anal probe. All of the voices are also included, making it feel more like the real cartoon than a rally game. You can also play an all-on-all 4 player mode.</desc>

		<desc>In 1991, the U.S.S.R. (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) boasting the largest military force in history, suddenly and unexpectedly collapsed. Since that time the fallen empire has lain lifeless -- a rich corpse waiting to be picked clean. Now, a sinister ex-KGB general codenamed Shadowman directs a flock of vultures to swoop in from all parts of Eastern Europe and claim Russia's nuclear warheads and weapons of mass terror. While directing these 'wars of liberation' Shadowman intends to shake democratic Russia to it's foundations, bringing about a return to the Cold War...or even worse. You chopper into Crimea and discover the plot of this Russian madman using thermal spy devices. You must quickly move on to the Black Sea to prevent the hijacking of ICBM ships, respond to an attack on a chemical weapons plant in the desert passes, and then recover a nuclear reactor core in Transylvania. As you successfully thwart these stages of Operation Vulture, Shadowman is forced to take his coup to the streets of Moscow. Guide your chopper through five unique 3D worlds as you complete 41 deadly missions. Enemy vehicles, tactics, and responses change, based upon your activities, making this the first of STRIKE's new "Living Battlefields".</desc>

		<desc>You are a space marine commander of an elite fighting squad called the Terminators, a specialized unit that is part of the Blood Angels chapter of the Imperium. Under the guidance of the Emperor, the Imperium has been able to gradually expand across the galaxy using Warp Drive technology. This invention has revolutionized space travel, allowing for great distances to be covered in a matter of hours.
 Of course, there is a downside to expanding one's territory in the 41st millennium: alien hostility. Various dangers now threaten the livelihood of mankind. Your mission? To eradicate man's greatest foe: the Genestealers, a purple-skinned race with razor-sharp teeth and six limbs. Since they reproduce by finding other races to serve as hosts, they are an aggressive threat that must be stopped at all costs. The plan calls for intercepting their ships known as Space Hulks, before they can infest an unsuspecting planet.</desc>

		<desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank."  The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier.  Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion.  And none too soon, because the Invaders are back!

Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision.  (See Battlezone and Asteroids.)  But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari.  The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies.

You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels.  You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth.  There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones.  You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row.  As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots.  Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss.  If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars.

The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three.

Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates.

The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game.

The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt.

There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up.

The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out.

There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</desc>

		<desc>The first Spec Ops title on the PlayStation to feature a third-person 3D shooting style, Spec Ops: Airborne Commando literally drops you behind enemy lines as an elite U. S. Ranger paratrooper equipped with essential gear and a lethal arsenal. Weapons include a standard military knife, a Colt 1911A1 Semiautomatic pistol, silenced M4 rifle, sniper rifle (Barret M82A1), the M3 RAAW reusable launcher rifle, hand grenades, and C4 demolition packs. Binoculars, a laptop, and a handheld radio round out the inventory, with satellite imaging available for locating positions of rangers, checkpoints, helicopter extractions, and both real and decoy SAM launchers.

Players earn awards and promotions for successfully completing the 16 missions, with scores based on factors such as reconnaissance and intelligence recovered, rescue of hostages, enemies killed, and demolition. Ten ranks can be achieved, ranging from Private E1 to Sergeant Major and, depending on success, six decorations and medals can be earned, including The Purple Heart, Bronze or Silver Stars and the Congressional Medal of Honor. Airborne Commando features five difficulty settings, ranging from Super Easy (10 extra lives) to Super Hard (no extra lives).</desc>

		<desc>Spec Ops: Covert Assault is the third game in the budget-priced Spec Ops line for the PlayStation. The series takes the first-person shooter genre and attempts to fuse it with aspects of real combat, in the hopes of giving players a sense of what it is actually like to take on dangerous black ops military missions. Covert Assault is no different in this regard, as you'll take on the role of two different elite rangers as they scour the globe, quietly ridding it of evil at every turn.

In Covert Assault, you choose two rangers from a host of different soldiers with their own abilities. Select from the machine gunner, close-quarters fighter, sniper, grenadier, and rifleman. Once you've chosen your rangers, you will be able to customize them with a whole host of different guns and items such as body armor and grenades. You then enter into the game, which is made up of four different missions, ranging from the island of Sicily to the deep anonymous jungles of a far away place.</desc>

The action takes place in 3D-rendered environments as the player guides the characters from a third-person perspective. In the single-player version of the game, the player takes the role of one soldier while the computer guides the other.</desc>

		<desc>The original Spec Ops for PC was one of the first realistic military tactical combat simulators to be released. After its limited success it spawned many rehashes, pseudo-sequels, and mission packs all bearing the same name. The Playstation's version of the rehash is Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol. Up to two players can simultaneously play through the series of missions the game has to offer. If there's only one player the second ranger is controlled by the CPU. The single player can switch between both rangers at any time, letting the CPU control the other ranger.

Join one of the most elite military task forces in the world--the U.S. Army Rangers. Play as a U.S. Special Operations Ranger Corps soldier in this third-person shooter. Your main objective: neutralize hostile terrorist threats around the world. With guns blazing or silently under the cover of darkness, navigate your team across harsh terrains of thick jungle, barren desert, arctic tundra, and dense forest. You must use stealth and tactics to your advantage. Oh, a few more squad members and weapons that range from sniper rifles to machines guns wouldn't hurt either. Take out terrorists, rescue hostages and save the free world...that's all this game is asking of you. Will you be able to complete your mission, even though you may be the lone survivor?</desc>

Based on the popular cartoon, Speed Racer joins the plethora of racing games available for the PlayStation. As Speed Racer himself, you can race on three different tracks simply titled S, M and L for small, medium and large. Before beginning a race you must choose between three slight variations of Speed Racer's famous white Mach 5, one of which has manual transmission. Each of the three cars is equipped with special features such as grip tires, rotary saws, a periscope, a deflector and auto jacks. Other options include 18 different soundtracks, normal and endurance racing modes and the ability to increase the speed and efficiency of your opponents.</desc>

		<desc>Speedball has been described as a cross between handball, roller derby, and hockey (though it's quite a bit more violent than any of those sports -- all in good fun of course). Two teams of nine players each face off in a closed arena with high walls on all sides and a goal at either end. The object is simply to throw the ball through the opponent's goal to score as many points as possible. Points can be scored in other ways as well however, such as lighting all of the stars on a wall or by hitting Bounce Domes with the ball.

The game is constantly moving as the steel ball is passed back and forth or stolen with a heavy body-slam or a quick elbow to the teeth. Special power-ups can increase scoring possibilities or even temporarily disable opposing players. Several modes of play are available, from quick one-time grudge matches to season-long league play.</desc>

You must also find exits in each area in order to advance to the next level.

The spider is always equipped with a Slasher leg and webbing, and he is capable of enhancing his fighting ability with weapons by collecting power-ups. The weapons include homing missiles, flame throwers, boomerangs, and electro-beams. You'll need these munitions to defend yourself against other spiders, cyber-rats, toxic green frogs, and other laboratory pests in this 3-D side-scrolling platform contest.</desc>

		<desc>Spider-Man is the first 3D game to star the popular web-slinger.  It is loosely based on Spider-Man: The Animated Series and Spider-Man Unlimited and features some of the voice cast from each and similar character designs.

Peter Parker is attending a demonstration of the reformed Dr. Otto Octavius's new invention when an imposter Spider-Man steals the device.  Spider-Man must work to clear his name and uncover the sinister motives behind the device's theft.

This game features appearances not only by most major Spider-Man characters, but cameos by numerous other characters from the Marvel Universe, such as the Human Torch, Punisher, Daredevil and Captain America.

Spider-Man's webs are greatly emphasized.  He can use them both for navigational purposes, like swinging or ziplining, and for offensive and defensive combat, such as tying up a villain, coating his fists with web for extra oomph, or building a protective shield.  His web supply is limited though and he must find new cartridges or risk running out.  The wall-crawling powers are also prominently features.  Spider-Man can cling to any wall or ceiling.  This is used for basic environmental navigation and for stealth as there are many sequences where you crawl over the heads of unsuspecting thugs, or drop down and catch them off-guard.

Combat is based around Spider-Man's ability to jump, kick, punch and web.  By combining these with direction and in various combinations, Spider-Man is able to throw objects such as furniture, hurl web balls, yank enemies into melee range and follow up with a flurry of hits, among other things.  There are a number of boss-battles as well, all of which are puzzle-based.

Missions vary from the fairly common fight-your way-to-the-goal or find-the-key-that-unlocks-the-door types to races to catch some or evade them or just trying to avoid the police.

There are several side goals in addition the main mission including multiple unlockable Spider-Man costumes and numerous hidden comic book covers to find.</desc>

		<desc>Spider-Man 2 - Enter: Electro is the second PlayStation game to feature Spider-Man, and also serves as the sequel to the 2000 video game Spider-Man. This game follows Spider-man as he attempts to stop his old enemy Electro from obtaining a source of power called the Bio-Nexus Device. Game bosses included Hammerhead, Lizard, Sandman, Shocker and the exclusive charged-up Hyper-Electro.

This sequel to Activision's 2000 multi-platform Spider-Man release features the title villain in a diabolical scheme to construct a device that will amplify his strange electricity-based powers and make him virtually unstoppable. Players take the role of their friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to foil Electro's plan before it's too late. Movement and camera angles are similar to those of the first Spider-Man game, though Spidey has a few new web-slinging abilities in this title and is challenged by some sophisticated puzzle-solving and complex action sequences. Once again, Marvel Comics' legendary Stan Lee provides narration for this adventure.</desc>

		<desc>The "Spin Jam" universe is in peril from the evil Moolamb. To foil his plans you must become the "Spin Jam" champion and defeat him in head to head combat. The characters you can choose to be are Gilly, Poppy, Wigsey, Aqualad, Babybot, Lemon Drop, Nips, &amp; Booger. The game revolves around firing colored bubbles from a launcher, located at the bottom of the play field, towards the center spindle. The player must then rotate the spindle in order to get three of the same colored bubbles adjacent. This leads to explosions that shoot bubbles towards the petals, which are surrounding the outside of the spindle. Fill a petal with the same colored bubbles and it will pop. When all petals have popped the level is complete. The games modes include a tutorial, arcade mode, battle mode, and story mode.</desc>

		<desc>Spyro the Dragon is a platform game developed by Insomniac Games for the PlayStation. It stars the title character, a young purple dragon named Spyro and his dragonfly friend, Sparx, and is the first game in the Spyro the Dragon series. The first game was massively popular at its initial release and Spyro would later become one of the most recognizable, popular and respected gaming icons for the PlayStation gaming console. Spyro's best friend, Sparx the dragonfly, acts like the player's health meter and assists in gathering gems. The various dragons Spyro unfreezes along the way are also key characters in Spyro's progression through the game. Gnasty Gnorc is the main antagonist, who froze all the dragons of the land in crystal.</desc>

Enter a world where love knows no bounds, the evil is neverending and good can overcome all if the heart is just and true. Featuring three battle modes, the ability to master skills to create items and an emotional level for each of the characters, Enix has pulled out all the stops in their latest (and first) title to be brought to the North American PlayStation.
 Star Ocean: The Second Story tells the stories of Claude C. Kenni, son of Ronixis J. Kenny, and Rena Lanford, a young girl living on the planet Expel. Claude, having recently been commissioned as an Ensign in the Earth Federation, is given his first mission under the supervision of his father. This first mission is to survey the planet Milocinia, where a mysterious energy field appears. Once they arrive, they find an alien ruin, filled with mostly broken machinery. Finding a mysterious device in the center of it, Claude begins to examine it close-up, despite orders to keep away from it. As he approaches, the machine activates, teleporting him to Expel.</desc>

		<desc>The Borg are once again invading Federation space. Their target? Sector 001, Earth. You are part of an elite flying team known as Valkyrie squadron, commanded by none other than Lieutenant Commander Worf of Star Trek: The Next Generation fame.

You'll fly through different territories and encounter familiar races from the popular television series, including Klingons, Romulans, Borg and a new enemy known as the Kam'Jahtae. There are twists and turns throughout the game as you protect convoys from enemy attacks, engage galaxy class starships, and go on solo retrieve and rescue missions. The storyline is accented by the voices of actors Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean-Luc Picard) and Michael Dorn (Lieutenant Worf).

Your ship is outfitted with phaser cannons and photon torpedoes, both of which you will have to master in order to succeed in your battles with enemy crafts. Users can play from a view behind their ship or from a first-person view inside the cockpit. The game supports analog control as well as force feedback, and uses up one block of memory on the standard PlayStation Memory Card to save progress.</desc>

		<desc>Kyle Katarn is a former Imperial officer turned mercenary, now hired by the Rebel Alliance. After having stolen the Death Star plans from a remote facility, he is tasked with investigating the sudden destruction of a hidden Rebel base. This leads him to face off against Imperial General Rom Mohc and the various iterations of his "Dark Troopers" - cybernetic soldiers with the armor and firepower to turn the tide of the war.

Dark Forces is a close prequel to the original Star Wars movie trilogy. The game marks LucasArts' first attempt to enter the first-person shooter market. Instead of licensing the Doom engine, like many competitors, LucasArts created its own internal "Jedi" engine. The Jedi engine contains advanced features over similar tech, including the ability to look up and down, jump, crouch, and limited support (in the build used for Dark Forces) for rooms (sectors) over rooms. 3D models also make occasional appearances inside the game, as turrets or Kyle's ship dropping him off or picking him up from each mission.</desc>

The dangerous sport of Podracing has been outlawed by the Empire, but Jabba the Hutt has decided to devise an even more dangerous contest in order to provide entertainment, and more importantly, to gain a profit. Combatants from across the galaxy compete in familiar Star Wars locations, such as Tatooine, Hoth, Dagobah, Naboo and Cloud City.

The game was released on both PlayStation and Dreamcast consoles. The game was released on PlayStation on November 12, 2000 and on November 19, 2000 for Dreamcast.</desc>

		<desc>Rebel Assault II is a rail-shooter "interactive movie" featuring a variety of action sequences. Rookie One will fly sequences in an X-Wing, the Millennium Falcon, speeder bikes and being on foot. His only real ability is the precise targeting and shooting of laser weapon and occasionally the chance to take cover and avoid obstacles. Rookie One will team up with other characters who will aid him and need to be defended in turn. Occasionally different paths can be chosen in the animation and different events triggered, but for the most part the game is a closed environment.</desc>

Altogether you'll have around 10 missions to get through before the galaxy is safe and your wingmen will help you along the way. And during those missions, you'll be expected to shoot out the sides of huge enemy battlecruisers, travel inside of enemy carriers and travel through the canyons of Redeye to deliver your payload.</desc>

		<desc>Sanvein is a fast-paced top down shooter where time is of the essence and every moment counts. The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia, called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from Utopia.
 The game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each "floor" is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they've cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use.
 All the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time.
 The game has a unique glitch-futuristic art style and five floors to play through. There are three ships and three weaponry systems to choose from.</desc>

		<desc>In Starwinder: The Ultimate Space Race, you assume the role of Conner Rhodes, the first representative of Earth sent to compete in a galaxy-wide race. This isn't an ordinary race, however -- an unknown alien race built magnificent rails/tracks throughout the confines of space. Spanning thousands of miles in length, rails act in such a way that when pilots navigate toward one, it increases the speed of the ship.

As Conner, your overall objective is to bring home the ultimate reward -- the globe-like Starsphere. While your mission sounds fairly basic, it won't be easy; there are seven other pilots vying for the same prize. Residing in the far reaches of the Milky Way, competition includes a half man/half machine humanoid named Ko-Axe, the vengeful Tianna Stone, and an overconfident egomaniac that goes by the name of Dextor -- The Terrible. There are also drone pilots that fill in the rest of the playing field.

Broken into quadrants, there are 44 different rails/tracks in which to race on; there are ten races per quadrant. While the bulk of the game is played against computer-controlled opposition, there are times when you'll race against the clock in a true test of speed and accuracy. Prove yourself worthy and you'll race against an elite group of pilots through Epsilon Indi -- the final railway. If you manage to win this final race, the Starsphere is as good as yours!</desc>

In each level you'll have specific missions to accomplish such as killing aliens, finding special weapons, saving humans, opening secret rooms, activating defense facilities, and destroying key enemy sites. You can teleport between locations by finding teleport cards and telepads. Access to specific buildings and other restricted areas can be gained with pass cards that you will find hidden throughout the levels. In addition to the standard action, you can also commandeer trucks, hovercraft, floating discs, and tanks.</desc>

		<desc>General Storm and his militia are out to take over the world, and it's up to you to stop them. 

Luckily, you are armed with a battalion of tank prototypes. While there are only three different types to choose from at the beginning, the number of choices will grow to 12 as more tanks are discovered throughout the game.

Play takes place in either the Arcade or Quest modes. Arcade has the player fighting through 10 levels of driving and shooting action, where players can pick up new weapons like laser beams, plasma cannons, and missiles. Between each mission, there is the opportunity to change tanks. 

Quest mode plays the same way, except the player is not given the opportunity to switch vehicles and must drive the same tank through all of the levels. Can General Storm be defeated?</desc>

		<desc>Street Fighter: The Movie is a 2D beat 'em up game based on the movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the well known Capcom series, Street Fighter. Using digitized animation based on the actors and the many locations featured in the film, the same style of gameplay found in Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo is used here. Select from a range of fighters (including Ryu, Ken, Guile, M. Bison and Chun Li) each with their own set of special moves, and defeat all of the opposition to become the King of Street Fighting.

Also included is a story mode which follows the story of the movie and uses FMV in-between fights and a Trial Battle Mode, where you take on Guile in a range of different battle events to test your skills.</desc>

		<desc>Another Street Fighter sequel (this time for Street Fighter Alpha) adds even more to the classic fighting series.

New characters in this version include Gen (a wise kung-fu master), Rolento (who you may remember from another Capcom classic, Final Fight) and Sakura, a young school girl who follows her hero Ryu so close, she has the same type of moves. Dhalsim and Zangief also return to the fight with some news moves.

The other major difference is the loss of chain-combos and the gain of a custom combo system. Once you reach the required level (which is 1 at the least) you can execute a custom combo by combining any of the buttons (which there are 6 in total) or any of the special attacks (fireballs, etc.)</desc>

Hawk, Dee Jay, Juni and Juli. Some of the newest fighters on the block include a former Final Fight character (Cody, who has been in jail since the last Final Fight game, or so his clothing suggests), Karin Kanzuki and Rainbow Mika.

The major difference between this Alpha and the last two are the new play modes World Tour, Arcade, VS, Training and Entry. </desc>

		<desc>It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

		<desc>Squash is a racquet sport played by two players in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. Squash is recognized by the IOC and remains in contention for incorporation in a future Olympic program.
 The game was formerly called squash racquets, a reference to the "squashable" soft ball used in the game (compared with the fatter ball used in its parent game racquets.
 Street Racquetball is one of very few console games featuring the enclosed sport of racquetball, though the first title devoted to the sport, Racquetball, was released in 1981 for the Atari Video Computer System. A1 Games' history of released sports related games includes tennis, boxing, bowling, kickboxing, snowboarding, racing and more.
 As in indoor racquetball courts, Street Racquetball's "outdoor" courts contain two sidewalls, a front wall, serving zones, and a receiving line -- but no ceiling. Players can opt for exhibition mode (against the computer), challenge mode (unlock new characters and courts by winning three consecutive matches), training mode (continuous rally solo play), or two-player VS mode. Three difficulty settings offer "easy," "normal." or "hard" gameplay, ball bounce levels can be adjusted to "low," "middle," or "high," and the eight computer-controlled opponents are rated in performance level, type of game, power, speed, and skill. Shots include slams, lobs, and drop shots.
 Features
 Unlock up to eight computer-controlled players with individual strengths and weaknesses

		<desc>Take to the streets on one of ten stylin' boards in the first skateboarding game for the PlayStation, courtesy of Electronic Arts and Micro Cabin. Two variations of play include the Street Tour Mode, where you skate through three 3D courses trying to pull off as many tricks as you can within a time limit, and Free Skate Mode, where you either play for points or practice your moves without worrying about the clock.
 Skaters can also play against a friend in Versus Mode to see who can pull off the most tricks. Street Sk8ter features 200 different moves and combinations to perform while racing, each of which earns your skater points depending on its level of difficulty. Of course, if you wipe out, you'll have points deducted from your score. Three other "traditional" areas are available, including a Half-Pipe, Big Air and Bowl.
 The main aspect of the game is the Street Tour, which is structured similar to a racing game: weave your way down sidewalks and streets, pass through checkpoints to extend your time, and finish before the clock winds down to zero. Along the way there will be plenty of opportunities to catch some air and perform tricks with the pad. The goal is to score as many points as possible with one of four alter-egos: TJ, Jerry, Ginger and Frankie.
 Each skater also differs in style (Goofy or Regular) and has individual ratings in jump power, cornering, maximum speed and acceleration. Playing through the Street Tour with different characters allows you to open up additional routes, unlock bonus skaters and reveal new decks (designs on the main platform area of a board). You'll even get to increase your character's overall ratings!
 After finishing each course, players will also be able to watch their performance on instant replay. Other notable features include: Dual Shock Controller support (vibration only), best times saved to memory card, an announcer, deck graphics from Powell Skateboards, and twelve alternative music tracks from bands under the Epitaph and Capitol Records labels.</desc>

		<desc>In a future ruled by tyranny and evil, a lone Strider named Hiryu must use his sharply honed skills to fight for justice and peace, and defeat the Grandmaster, an evil dictator who has taken over the world. 

The game features a number of improvements over the original. The graphics have been improved by making use of 2D animations placed on 3D backgrounds.

Strider now has a range of new moves including a double jump, backward somersault and dash, which allows him to perform longer jumps. He also has the ability to boost his weapon, the Cypher sword, enabling it to release homing plasma waves. There is also a Savage Slash attack, with random slashes.

There are numerous bonuses that can be collected in the levels. These either boost Striders vitality, increase the power of his sword or increase your game score.

A welcome addition to the game is a Boss Gauge which lets you know how much energy the mid- or end of level boss has left before it dies.</desc>

		<desc>A terrorist organization by the name of Hex is threatening the peace and prosperity of the world. If their demands are not met or they are not stopped, their Shockwave devices are armed and ready to go. Once detonated, they will reduce the world to utter chaos -- massive floods, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions will be the result.
 So, who's going to stop them? You are, as the leader of the StrikePoint Team. By taking to the skies and launching an all-out air assault on Hex, your only mission is to destroy their existence and world-destroying plans. You've got a lot of weight riding on your shoulders, better not let the world down.
 In StrikePoint, you will pilot one of three different helicopters, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Where one sacrifices maneuverability for the sake of shields and firepower, the other is stealthy and fast without a lot of weaponry. The other is a middle-of-the-road chopper that is balanced in every category.
 Played from various 3D perspectives (first-person, third-person), there is a multitude of missions to complete. For the most part, your objective will be to destroy any and all enemy resistance. Sometimes, your target will be a specific building or a search and rescue mission (captured allied intelligence). Your mission will not be easy as you are met with considerable resistance. Enemies come from both air and ground and you will have to deal with them accordingly.
 StrikePoint also comes equipped with a two-player feature where you and a friend can play a cooperative game against the computer or duke it out with each other in a combat mode.</desc>

		<desc>Loosely based on the classic medieval Chinese novel "Water Margins" (Shuihuzhuan) by Shi Nai'an. The game is a fantasy RPG set in an imaginary universe, its main theme being political struggle. The hero of the game is the young son of Theo McDohl, a general who serves the Scarlet Moon Empire, presently controlling the land of Toran. Through a series of events the hero becomes involved in a rebellion against the Empire, led by an organization known as the Liberation Army. Will the hero find a new home there, will he be able to tear himself away from everything that has been sacred to him, including his own father?

Suikoden is a console-style RPG with several unusual additions. There are three kinds of combat in the game, the most common one being the traditional turn-based party combat (players can have up to six people in their active party). Magic runes can be equipped on the player's characters which allow limited usage of offensive and healing spells. There are also army battles, where the player must control whole units of fighters, archers, magicians, etc., and one-on-one fights.

The game allows the player to build and customize a castle, which serves as their home base and fortress.108 characters can be recruited in the game, a tribute to 108 Stars Of Destiny in "Water Margins". Many of those characters will be available as active party members and participate in battles, while others will act as strategy advisers, or enhance the castle itself in various ways.</desc>

		<desc>Sequel to the early PlayStation RPG. As a member of the Alliance, a military force only really hinted at in the original, you play the unwitting hero of the game: an orphan who has been raised by a quiet, unassuming battle hero in a seemingly ancient war. Alongside you in the ranks is your best friend Jowy, a boy born of nobility but who has never been able to receive approval in his stubborn father's eyes. As the game begins, you are immediately tossed into a tale of political strife, betrayal and war on a grand scale beyond your scope in the early stages. As the game wears on, the plot will twist, turn and develop in numerous ways that expose the personalities of each of the characters involved. The battle system is turn-based, with the option to equip Runes for special abilities, combine party member attacks to create chain combos or devastating spells, and the option to run the battle in Auto mode.</desc>

As you throw them down the line, they will stack up in piles of six. Linking three bubbles together will pop them (remove them from the field), and if there is a stack of six, the bubbles on the way will form a new stack in front of it.

The aim of the game is to remove all bubbles from the field, but there is another way of completing a game. Tokens will appear during play, and by collecting enough, you can move on to the next round regardless of what you have on the playfield.</desc>

		<desc>A Tetris-like puzzle game featuring popular characters from many Capcom games.

Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo's Super Shot Soccer is a hybrid of simulation and arcade-styled soccer. Featuring over 30 teams from around the world, the game's play modes are based on international-styled soccer. The four play modes are Test Mode (exhibition play), World Tournament Play (inspired by soccer's World Cup), International League (a round-robin league) and International Cup (a 16 team tournament). Of these modes, only Test Mode allows two players to play the game at the same time.
 Differing itself from typical soccer simulation titles, Super Shot Soccer provides over the top arcade-style plays. Called Super Shot Special Moves, each team has two or three special moves that tie into the team's nationality. These provide a unique twist to simulation soccer, as gameplay can be interrupted by national monuments, disaster attacks and more. Special moves can be used to affect both offensive and defensive strategies.</desc>

The starting light turns green and you hit the gas, sending your bike flying over the initial jump at Bank One Ballpark. The rest of the field tries to find their bearings after being blown away by your aggressive start. You fly around corners, shredding up the dirt which paves the course. Your arch-rival closes in, but you cut him off on the sharp "hairpin" turn and he's left spinning out on the side. You throttle up and do a little show-boating for the crowd as the checkered flag is waved in your honor! If you thought that little teaser sounded good, then brace yourself for Supercross 2000 for the PlayStation.</desc>

		<desc>Supercross Circuit is a motorcycle racing game with both supercross and motocross tracks.  In addition to the handful of fictional "local" tracks there are 9 tracks that are modeled after actual national event courses.  Included in the game are 15 professional riders, and licensed gear and bikes to choose for your rider.  

When you start a race you are given the opportunity to set up the suspension, exhaust, and brakes.  Racing modes, include Free Ride, Time Trial, and Season.  The majority of the tracks must be opened in Season mode before they can be ridden in Free Ride.  

Application of the brake, helps the bike make tight turns, and the use of the goose button, along with weight shift, can help maximize or minimize air on any given jump.  There are 7 AI riders on the track in single player mode, and 2 AI players in 2 player split screen racing.  There are a dozen tricks that can be performed in the air with various combinations of the shoulder buttons, and points are listed for using a variety of the tricks, although it doesn't affect the winner of the race.

In season mode, you need to buy new tires, and add parts to your bike for increased performance.  You also upgrade from  a 125cc, to a 250cc, and finally a 400cc bike.</desc>

The World Challenge Cup mode is for all the marbles -- the championship. A round in this mode consists of three heats: the qualifying, semifinal and final. Each heat has four computer-controlled competitors. You must place either first or second in order to advance to the next heat.

In addition to supporting the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog controls and vibration, Surf Riders uses a memory card to save game progress. Additionally, it features a soundtrack composed of surf-rock bands including Los Straitjackets, The Aquamen and Pollo Del Mar.</desc>

		<desc>That Swagman sure has a lot of nerve! He's another evil, demented fellow who's planning to take over the world for his own personal gain. And this guy means business. You see, he's basically a boogie-man who has the power to entrap people in their own nightmares forever. Fortunately, there are two brave souls out there ready to fight Swagman face to face. Their names are Zac and Hannah, two 8 year old twins.
 Swagman is a combination of the platform and adventure genre. While in the "Real World", the game is adventure-like; find and collect items and/or keys to open certain doors. When you enter the dream sequences, called the Territories, the game becomes a platform game. The combination of genres and the whole real world/dream world is a neat idea and throw in some nice, cartoonish and highly colorful graphics and you've got a nifty little game.
 Features:
 - Help twins Zack and Hannah escape a nightmarish world
 - Explore six levels to defeat the evil Swagman
 - Use Warp Circles to change positions</desc>

		<desc>The official video game of the Games of the XXVII Olympiad held in 2000 in Sydney. It includes 32 nations, going for gold in 12 events divided by 6 sports: Athletics (100m dash, 110m hurdles, hammer and javelin throw, triple jump and high jump), Aquatics (200m freestyle and 10m platform diving), Kayak K1 Slalom, Super Heavyweight Weight Lifting, Skeet Shooting and Three-man track cycling pursuit. All events feature 3D graphics with cameras that mimic the ones used in TV broadcasts.

Gameplay is the usual found in games of the genre - button mashing the two power buttons is required in most events to build up strength/speed, with an additional third button setting the actions, such as jumping or throwing angle. Other events feature alternate control methods, such as Slalom (where it's possible to press certain buttons to dodge the rower between the gates if the Kayak is going to hit one or place the paddle to force into a certain direction),  Diving (following a "click-along" sequence of keys) and Skeet (the direction keys controlling the aim, one button to start and other to shoot).

Along an arcade and 8-player action, the Olympic mode gives the player the option to build their athlete from the national open trials to the Olympics. By completing training drills in the Cyber Gym, the athlete increases his athletic abilities: Citius, Altius, Fortius, as told by the Olympic Motto. Before joining the competition, the player must beat national, continental and international opponents.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2046 and the Togusa building has been occupied by terrorists. The building is owned by a major military supplier called Machine Gear and houses some important scientists. The T.R.A.G. (Tactical Rescue Assault Group) team is sent out to resolve the situation and free the hostages, but are all caught in a trap. With only two survivors, team members Alex and Michelle, it's up to them to take out the threat themselves.

Gameplay resembles the early Resident Evil games, with its 3D characters over fixed pre-rendered backdrops and combination of puzzle solving and action elements. One big difference, however, is the ability to switch between any of the characters at any given time. This feature is used to solve certain puzzles and to find different routes through the Togusa building. Throughout the game you will acquire four different allies to aid you. You never find new weapons in the game, so you need to use the characters wisely and where needed, since they all have different abilities and arms. You can also split them up in teams of two, to make things more versatile.</desc>

Very soon he finds out it is not just an ordinary sword, but the legendary talking sword Dymlos, who has been sleeping for many years and who can be awakened only if the world is in grave danger. But what exactly is the danger that awakened Dymlos now? With the help of a few friends, Stahn decides to explore the world and to find out what is wrong. 
 "Tales of Destiny" is a follower of the SNES RPG Tales of Phantasia. The combat in this game is action-based. You control the main hero in real time and make him perform various attacks. Other party members are controlled by the game's AI, but you can pause the battle at any time and assign new combat style to any one of them.
 PLOT:
 In the past, a comet crashed into the world, throwing dust clouds into the sky and shrouding the world in cold and darkness. At about the same time, the inhabitants, the Aethers, discovered a new form of energy from the meteorite's core, which they named Lens. Combining this with further research, the people were able to create cities in the sky and live in them. Unfortunately, only a select few were chosen, leaving the rest of the people to remain on the bleak surface of the planet. These people became known as the Erthers.
 Over time, the sky's inhabitants became known as the Aetherians and their Aeropolis cities. They created a horrific weapon called the Belcrant that shot down any who dared oppose them. This caused full scale war to erupt between the two civilizations, now known as the Aeth'er Wars. However, regardless of their will and persistence, the Aetherians continued to have the power to dominate every engagement through the use of their superweapon.
 In their disgust of their civilization's elitist behavior, a group of Aetherian scientists went to the surface. There, with aid from the people, they were able to create special swords, called Swordians, that were sentient. Unlike other weapons, these swords chose their masters and were able to call upon the elements of nature to do their will. Using these weapons, the people of the surface finally had an edge against the Aetherians.
 Thanks in part to the Swordians and their masters, scores of Aeropolis were sunk to the depths of the ocean. In the end, the Erthers claimed victory over the Aetherians. Thousands of years later, this s</desc>

		<desc>Reid and Farrah are two friends who live together in a little town. One day, a mysterious young girl falls down from the sky and is found by the two friends. After a while, they discover that her name is Meredy and that she has come to prevent the collision of her world Celestia with Inferia, the planet on which Reid and Farrah live. The three decide to set out on a quest to collect elemental spiritual beings that alone can stop the terrible disaster.

Tales of Destiny II (Tales of Eternia in Japan) is an action RPG with a somewhat unusual battle system. Although there is a party, the battles occur in real time. The player physically controls only Reid, making him perform various attacks. The other party members are controlled by the game's AI, but it is possible to choose an overall strategy for their actions: for example, one should concentrate on healing while the other attacks physically, etc.</desc>

All of a sudden, a large, flat, grey, flying THING blocked out the sun (The Great Eclipse) and began to drop crates. These crates were filled with all sorts of goodies such as Uzis and Bazookas. Inevitably, chaos broke out and the buddies became segregated according to color.</desc>

		<desc>If you're looking for a game that the whole family can enjoy, then look no further than TECMO STACKERS. Against the computer or a friend, you'll go head-to-head in some fast-paced puzzle games that will bow you away. The object is to fill your opponent's side of the board while keeping your own side clear of any blocks.
 If you connect four quads (blocks) of the same color, you'll create a chain reaction that will really give you an advantage. If you find yourself in a pinch, utilize a bomb to temporarily clear your board. There are four gameplay modes to choose from Arcade Competition, Time Trials, Chain Reaction, and Insane and more than 20 levels to master, making TEMCO STACKERS one of the most complete action or puzzle games available.</desc>

		<desc>The original Tecmo Bowl was an instant hit on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game combined simple, easy to grasp arcade action, insanely catchy music and real NFL players. Tecmo's sequel in 1991, Tecmo Super Bowl, added the NFL license and detailed statistical tracking for an entire season. It was considered by many as the best football game released for the 8-bit system. The series would continue into the 16-bit market, with three games released on both the SNES and Genesis (Tecmo Super Bowl, Tecmo Super Bowl II and Tecmo Super Bowl III). While it would face heavy competition from the Maddens and Montanas, the game still maintained a strong loyal following--a testament to its universal appeal.
 Tecmo Super Bowl marks its first appearance on the Playstation after success in the both the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets. While the name hasn't changed, the game has undergone several refinements--perhaps none more dramatic than the ability to change the field's perspective. Instead of a horizontal view, you can now adjust the camera to a vertical or diagonal position. Instant replay, a tournament mode, expanded playbooks and live commentary have also been added to the game, to bring it up to speed with similar PlayStation sports offerings.
 The hallmarks of the Tecmo series have been left unchanged: you still get both the NFL and NFLPA licenses, variable weather conditions, stat tracking, injuries, multiple schedules and an emphasis on arcade action. Don't like how your team is performing? Feel free to edit players' names, abilities or trade them away! Just make sure you save enough room on your memory card--a hefty eleven blocks is needed to save your data.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo World Golf distinguishes itself from all previous console golf games by offering 101 (yes, that's 1-0-1) authentic Japanese courses to play on. Choose from four male or four female players, each differing in power and shot tendency, or customize your own character.

You'll be able to edit the golfer's name, appearance, handicap (from one to forty) and shot tendency, which determines the ball's trajectory after contact is made. You can also adjust each club's maximum shot distance and the golfer's starting tee position to improve your performance out on the links.</desc>

		<desc>Tekken is an arcade fighting game franchise created and developed by Namco. Beginning with the original Tekken arcade game released in 1994, the series has received several sequels, as well as various home conversions and spin-off titles released for consoles. The story in each game in the main series documents the events of the fictional martial arts tournament, The King of Iron Fist Tournament, which is hosted by the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation. The prize is typically control of the company, which then allows the winner to host the following tournament.
The arcade versions of the game have traditionally used PlayStation based hardware to run the games, and subsequently each Tekken installment was eventually made for its respective PlayStation.</desc>

		<desc>In Tempest X3 for the PlayStation, you control a claw that perches and crawls around the outer edge of a series of geometrically shaped, tube-like constructs, shooting down or out into the nebulous void of outer space. From the core of this void, fuseballs, rockets, pulsars, tankers and other hazardous aliens and alien artifacts move toward your ship. Once you clear a screen, you fly into the void and onto the next level. Watch out for spikes as you advance.
 This game features three modes of play: Classic Tempest, which is based on the early 1980s Arcade smash simply titled Tempest; an update of Tempest called Tempest X, which features a jump feature, A.I. Droids that help you fight and enhanced graphics and sound; and Tempest Duel, which pits you against a friend and the Generator, which cranks out an endless source of enemies.
 Features:
 * Blast through 99 colorful levels
 * Features both competitive and cooperative play for two
 * Includes the 1981 original and an enhanced version with new layouts and weapons</desc>

		<desc>Tired of wasting your hard-earned money at the local bowling alley? Are the rented bowling shoes a bit on the raunchy side? Would you rather conserve gas and stay home? If so, grab a copy of Ten Pin Alley and hit the virtual lanes in the comfort of your very own living room! You'll have a choice of three environments: the modern Ten Pin Alley, an old-styled Maui Bowl and the nighttime light show found within the Conga Bowl.
 Developed by Adrenaline Entertainment, Ten Pin Alley features twelve different characters (both male and female) with varying styles and playing characteristics. While some bowl left-handed and concentrate on accuracy, others specialize in speed and power. When it's your turn to hurl the ball down the lane, a bowling meter appears -- this meter regulates spinning, power and releasing techniques. Although putting spin on the ball is optional, you'll need to adjust your character's positioning in accordance. Failure to do so may result in an embarrassing gutter ball.
 There are three different gameplay options including the Open Play, Team Play and Tournament modes. Whether perfecting your skills or playing against a number of computer-controlled or human opponents, the Open Play is a no-frills single game. Team Play involves two or three teams in a heated bowling match-up. Teams may consist of both AI characters and/or human players. Whenever you're ready to take on fierce competition, sign yourself up for the TPA Tour! Featuring a field of 64 players, the Tournament incorporates knockout styled gameplay until a champion is crowned. There are two specific Tournament styles including the Amateur or Professional modes. Whereas the former features tougher opposition and bigger prizes, the Amateur mode is suited for novice players.
 Ten Pin Alley features the ability to create your own personal bowler and customize the weapon of choice -- your bowling ball. There's also a statistical tracker that records your personal data, everything from strikes to how much money you've made in professional tournaments. For novice players, the instruction manual outlines the scoring methodology of how many points are awarded after obtaining a strike or a spare. It supports any PlayStation Memory Card for saving game data and the Multi Tap for six human players.</desc>

		<desc>After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life while his back is turned.
 Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame, with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions. You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields of elusiveness and effectiveness.
 Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you). Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja. 
 A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords. For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.</desc>

		<desc>With no stat tweaking and no licenses, Tennis Arena is arcade-style tennis at its most fundamental.
 What you have here is single-match or tournament play for up to four players with wacky characters and a few different courts to play on. You can play an obese Chinese man, for example, and compete in a Roman coliseum whose clay surface seems to affect bounce marginally. That's about it for options though. No sim, Tennis Arena serves up roughly the same level of fun as Pong did 25 years ago, albeit now with prettier graphics and the occasional super smash.
 The game also features special shots, with visible trails, fighter-plane-like sound effects, and higher ball speed. These must be earned however. After successfully returning the ball over the net six consecutive times, a yellow star appears under the character. You may then attempt to use the special shot, which entails lining up with the ball just right - but a failed special shot doesn't erase the stored potential.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on the Discworld novel series created by Terry Pratchett. You play Rincewind, a wizard with of little courage or talent in the occult.
 A dragon is ravaging Ankh-Morpork, the city Rincewind the wizard lives in. The Arch Chancellor sends him to slaigh the beast and you must help him! So you wake up and take your luggage with you (which thinks it's a dog) and search for anything you can use to kill that dragon.
 Talk to the people of the Discworld (a flat world on which Ankh Morpork lies), though most are useless because they're all mad. And that's exactly the funny part of the game, conversations which lead to nowhere and objects you find on your quest must often be used on such strange things that it's not even logical anymore. This game is meant for gamers who love English humour and like playing an adventure.
 Gameplay:
 The game is one of the most illogical graphic adventures released on PSX: Most of the puzzles have no logic at all and can even be really frustrating.</desc>

		<desc>The 24 Heures Du Mans is the Super Bowl of the racing world. The event, created in 1923, exudes an immense measure of status. In it, the best in the world compete in a brutal, day long race. The goal is to complete the most laps around the famous Le Mans track in a 24-hr. period.
 In Le Mans, the player is offered a choice of three different car classes. On the one hand, we have the GT2 class. It is the easiest of the group, offering a good level of handing. The second type is the GT1. The GT1 cars are designed with professional racing in mind. Although difficult to control, these cars are the most powerful of the classes. Only an experienced driver can handle the GT1 class. Finally, we have the Prototype class of car. These vehicles lie slightly below the GT1 in terms of performance.
 Le Mans offers a number of play modes. The Arcade mode is designed for a quick thrill. It can satisfy the action junkies need for an adrenaline high. In it, the cars are completely indestructible, putting the emphasis on the racing. As the name implies, the Challenge races offer a bunch of difficult obstacles to overcome. Beating the opponent cars will open up a new series of Challenge tracks. The Time Attack mode pits the racer against the clock. Victory in the Time Attack mode will unleash a new fleet of cars.
 The Championship mode is a little bit deeper. In it, the player will participate in an entire racing season, culminating in the famous 24 Heures Du Mans. The Championship mode starts with the GT2 class of car. Upon beating the first series of races, the player will be able to move on to the other car types. Finally, Le Mans offers the Le Mans 24 hr mode. In game time, the Le Mans race lasts the entire 24-hr. period. The player can choose to shorten the outcome by resetting the game time. Be careful, though, as the car can take a lot of damage in a long race.
 Le Mans offers a split screen multi-player mode. In addition, it supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller and the Memory Card.
 Features:
 * 3 play modes: arcade, simulation, and endurance
 * Authentic Le Mans circuit tracks
 * 24 officially licensed racing teams
 * Day and night driving conditions
 * Dual Shock Controller support</desc>

		<desc>It's time to wander off the beaten path with Test Drive Off-Road, the first off-road racing game in the popular driving series. Players can hit the road with one of four licensed 4x4 vehicles, each rated in speed, handling and acceleration: a Hummer, Land Rover Defender 90, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet K-1500 Z71.
 Once you select a vehicle, you'll be able to choose from four color schemes, enter your name and compete in a Mixed League or Class League. Depending on the league, you'll race against other vehicles of the same class or challenge all classes for one of six different cups. Nine camera angles let you change perspectives on-the-fly, including a dashboard view complete with a moving steering wheel!
 There are twelve 3D tracks in total, covering such terrain as dirt, snow, sand and rocks: County Road, Jump Jet, Sand Speedway, Ridge Runner, Devil's Elbow, Winter Wonderland, Dirt Dash, Pharaoh's Curse, Sand Trap, Under Construction, Snowball Express and Pipeline Way. A Practice mode will let you learn the ins-and-outs of these courses once you open them up within competition.
 Options include choosing anti-skid, power steering, friction, vehicle damage and one of three difficulty levels. In addition, best times, user names and league progress can all be saved to memory card. An announcer will comment on the action while you race, and the soundtrack is performed by TVT Records' Gravity Kills. Bored with racing the three computer drivers? Challenge a friend on a split-screen or via Link Cable!</desc>

		<desc>Test Drive Off-Road 2 follows the path set by 1997's Test Drive: Off-Road as you drive across twelve courses (based on six locales: Morocco, Hawaii, Mojave, Santa Cruz, Switzerland and Wales) in your quest to win races on the World Tour. This time twenty vehicles are available to choose from, but before you can get behind the wheel, you'll have to purchase them with credits earned from winning races.
 Some of the licensed vehicles include a Hummer, Dodge Ram, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Explorer, Jeep Cherokee, Range Rover, Ford F-150 and a Dodge T-Rex. The World Tour consists of five events divided by class: Hummer, Safari, SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle), Truck and Military. Each class has you competing against five similar vehicles in a series of races, where you'll need to place within the top three in order to advance to the next track.
 Win the class and you'll not only unlock certain courses, but move one step closer to participating in the Open Class. In order to access this final event, you'll have to place first in all five races comprising the World Tour. Notable features include Dual Shock Analog Controller support, three difficulty settings for single races, your choice of automatic or manual transmission, multiple controller configurations and memory card support to save top scores. As in the original, an alternative soundtrack will accompany you while racing, including tracks from such artists as Gravity Kills, Sevendust and Fear Factory.</desc>

		<desc>Tetris Plus is a puzzle video game developed by Natsume and published by Jaleco for arcades exclusively in Japan in 1996, and was ported to the Game Boy, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation later that year. The game would be followed by a sequel, Tetris Plus 2, in 1997.
 GAMEPLAY:
 The game consists of two main modes, Classic Mode and Puzzle Mode. Classic Mode functions like the original Tetris game for the Game Boy except with different music and visuals. However, because the cartridge has battery-powered SRAM, it also has the ability to remember your high-scores, unlike the original Game Boy game. Puzzle Mode is a twist on the classic gameplay that provides a new scenario. Also included is an editor for making Puzzle levels, and Link capability for going head-to-head with another player in either game mode. The Console Versions also have a two player Versus Mode which is essentially puzzle mode with two players racing for the finish line.
 PUZZLE MODE:
 The biggest addition to Tetris Plus is the Puzzle Mode. The player starts by choosing any of four world locations: Maya, Knossos, Egypt, or Angkor Wat. The final area, Atlantis, is unlocked by successfully completing the other four stages (in any order). Each of the four locations has a different level set. Once the game starts, the player is presented with a cluster of pre-placed bricks, and the professor enters the play-area through a disappearing gate. The objective is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and crushes him.
 The player's goal is to guide this archaeologist to the bottom as fast as possible. Two blocks wide and tall, he will aimlessly walk forward until he bumps into a block, after which he turns around and walks the other way. If he comes across a gap that is large enough for him to fit through, he will fall down onto the blocks below him. Conversely, if blocks are placed on top of him, he will climb up them until he reaches the top. As one could guess, if these blocks lead too closely to the spikes, the professor will die.
 Upon starting the level, the spiked ceiling will start at the top of the play-area. About once every eighteen seconds, it will move down one row, slowly taking away workable space. The player is able to make the ceiling go back up, however, if they can clear three or four rows at once. The ceiling will also destroy any placed blocks that are in its way. This can be used as a g</desc>

There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.</desc>

		<desc>Theme Park is a construction and management simulation game designed by Bullfrog Productions and originally released in 1994, in which the player designs and operates an amusement park.
 Like most of Bullfrog's games, Theme Park is permeated by an eccentric sense of humor. Theme Hospital is Bullfrog's thematic successor to the game, while Chris Sawyer's Roller Coaster Tycoon series has evolved the concept to offer a far more realistic selection of rides.
 Dominating the exciting world of Theme Park ownership is your goal in this strategy game from Bullfrog. The first task is to set up your rides within the available land, structuring convenient paths and queues and ideally leaving some space for bigger rides once they become available, and include some lakes and trees to increase the park's allure. Rides range from Teacups and Haunted Houses to the biggest most elaborate roller-coaster you can design, and water rides that loop around other rides.
 Shops must also be included, so that the visitors can buy food, drinks and souvenirs - the cunning player will combine salt, sugar and caffeine settings to maximize consumer interest. Staff must be hired to keep everything running smoothly, and they will only work for what they consider a fair rate of pay.
 You are competing against other Theme Parks, so don't let them get an advantage over you - monitor your success in attracting customers and financial viability closely using the supplied statistics pages. More important, ensure that research is adequately funded to produce new rides.
 It can be played in three modes - Sandbox level lets you concentrate on the park design elements, while Sim and Full add more strategic features.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Starting with a free plot of land in the United Kingdom and few hundred thousand dollars, the player must build a profitable amusement park, making money by opening rides and selling merchandise and refreshments. The goal is to increase the park's value and available cash so that the park can be sold and a new lot can be bought from another part of the world and start building a new theme park.[3] Newer products can be bought after researching them. Once enough money has been made the player can move on to newer plots. Plots are located all over the world and have many different factors that affect gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value.
 There are over thirty attractions available in the game. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the p</desc>

		<desc>In the quiet country of Tradguld, there are many sleepy little towns. Langoud rests on the coast, Sharan is the floating city where most of the trade and business is done, and Myscatonia is clouded in mystery and wonder. Each city has nothing in common with the other except for the fact they share the same country. That is until the Dianova sets their sights on them. Dianova is a dark evil empire bent on conquering the world through swords and magic.
 PLOT:
 Meis Triumph lives in the nature-rich town of Kant deep within the countryside of Tradguld. He has no worries and lives with his loving family who happens to be powerful Spirit Blacksmiths. Then the Dianova brought their war-machine crashing down on his quiet life. Everyone was forced to flee in terror and Meis became separated from the family he loved. He fled to Boyzby where he vows to free his people from the terror and oppression of the Dianovan Empire and where he meets the beautiful Sodina. Now the adventure truly begins.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Thousand Arms by Atlus is an RPG with a faceted story and intricate gameplay. As in all RPGs, it has a turn-based combat system but only the character in the fist position may attack. The other two members of your party are used for defensive back-up.
 You play as Meis Triumph, heir to the Triumphs, a family of Spirit Blacksmiths. You can add two other members to the war party. You must travel the world and talk to people in the cities and towns to get valuable allies and information that will aid you on your quest. Stop in the village shops to get new armor, weapons and other items to truly make your band of heroes unstoppable.
 You also have to go on dates as all great heroes do. Rather than seeking love, these dates have another purpose. Keep your date happy and you can get special weapons, information and new abilities. So be sure to be a gentleman and always pay attention to what must be done in the mini-games to win her over!
 As a Spirit Blacksmith you have the ability to make weapons better by increasing their attack and defensive power as well as adding new features and spells. Of course, along the way you must battle enemies, explore dungeons and perform mini-quests in order to achieve your ultimate goal: the destruction of the Dianovan Empire and the evil Mecha.
 Are you hero enough to save your people? Are you suave enough to be a great date? Do you have the emotional and spiritual power to be a truly powerful Spirit Blacksmith? Pray you do; your entire r</desc>

		<desc>Tour the world and ride open and interactive terrain through 12 levels of real-world skate spots from your hometown to New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and international hotspots in the UK and Germany. The open-nature of the courses allow for constant mixing up of tricks on the quest to find the perfect line.

Choose from six different fictional skaters with varying degrees of strength and weakness. For a tough and versatile skater, choose Axl or for a more balanced skater take Kahli on your mission. Each skater features their own skating and clothing style.

Although each skater offers a different and varying skill level, their mission objectives are the same. Each player starts off as a wanna-be amateur skater with no sponsor or street credibility. Your goal is to turn your skater into the Thrasher Magazine Skater of the Year.</desc>

		<desc>Threads of Fate combines the gameplay of a real-time 3d adventure with an RPG typical character-system. The game provides two different main characters and two different storylines.

The young warrior Rue embarks on a journey to revive his lost beloved guardian, Claire. Mint, who lost  her right to the throne of East Heaven Kingdom, is seeking world domination and vengeance against her younger sister. Both of them live in the same world at the same time and both of them are looking for the same powerful relic to help them achieve their goals.

On their journey both characters have to explore areas filled with challenging puzzles and unusual enemies. To solve certain mysteries or clear certain obstacles, they have to make use of special abilities. By using collected coins, Rue has the ability to shape-shift into the forms of defeated monsters, whereas Mint can learn and use a variety of powerful magical spells.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Trucks offers nine rugged off-roaders with which to race across jagged, imposing terrains. Not the only game to twist the racing genre to this end, but as you'd expect from Psygnosis, the quality of presentation is head and shoulders above the rest.

There are two types of courses; circuits offer demanding hilly terrains which can easily trash the vehicle and must be learned intimately. Endurance courses offer greater freedom, with the aim of finding the best route to link eight dispersed checkpoints.

To avoid any disorientation, arrows guide you to the next marker. Each area, be it snowy or volcanic, has characteristic features and hazards, yet this doesn't stop a repetitive feel developing. The third option is a fun mode, and one you might expect from the developer of Destruction Derby. Players have sixty seconds to take their truck on a car smashing spree.</desc>

		<desc>Your name is General John T. Maclaine and you are the pilot of Firestorm 1, the lead dog in special attack missions to various parts of the world. Your helicopter is extremely powerful and carries the following weapons: 30mm Chain Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons -- plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq.
 Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC &amp; Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up.
 The graphics in Thunderstrike 2 are drawn completely with 3D polygons, including the helicopter's cockpit. As you track an enemy, the view changes so that it is always in your sights. There are 8 campaigns to complete, each with multiple missions.
 A blistering airborne monster of a game, offering 37 levels of arcade action viewed from the cockpit of a Thunderhawk attack helicopter. Firestorm offers all the thrills and spills of flying without the need to master the complexities of more traditional flight simulations.
 The speed and attention to detail in the graphics will hit you between the eyes, while a gentle gameplay undercurrent that calls for strategic thinking during missions - as well as for arcade-sharp reflexes - ensures that Firestorm Thunderhawk 2 will present an extended challenge to the most trigger-happy aviator. Clearly a thinking man's shoot-em-up, Firestorm also offers the fun and satisfaction of a flight sim without the learning curve and concentration needed just to stay in the air.</desc>

		<desc>Tiger Woods 99 PGA Tour Golf is the fourth PlayStation golf title from Electronic Arts and first to promise you'll play 18 holes within 30 minutes. Play as the champion or one of seven other PGA Tour pros on five different 3D courses: TPC at Southwind, TPC at Summerlin, TPC at Las Colinas, TPC at Sawgrass and TPC of Scottsdale.
 There are a total of eight different modes of play: Practice, Stroke Play, The Skins Game, Tournament, Shoot-Out, Foursome Match, Four Ball Match and Tour Play, with the latter making its debut in this release. Tour Play lets you play in a season of five four-round tournaments referred to as events. Participating in each event will earn you money, but the goal of winning the major is your main incentive.
 Also new to the series is the option to use the analog control stick to perform your swing. This involves pressing back and the moving in a forward motion, trying to be as straight as possible. The faster the analog movement, the more powerful the shot. Fans of previous games need not worry, because the traditional three click method has also been included. Another option is the "Tiger Charge," which allows you to swing the full distance potential of the club as long you continue to achieve par or win holes. The Tiger Charge is activated whenever you break par or best your opponent on three consecutive holes. Speaking of opponents, if you play with a friend you can perform a taunt by pressing the buttons while he or she is up to swing!
 Features:
 * Hit the links as Tiger Woods or seven other PGA pros
 * Five championship courses including Sawgrass, Scottsdale, and Summertin
 * Nine modes of play including fast-paced 30-minute play</desc>

		<desc>As Richard Miller, your primary objective is to eliminate all moving targets and save the girl; if you accept this mission, there will be lots of carnage and death following in your wake.
 Developed by Namco and previously released in the Arcade, Time Crisis is a first-person on-rails light gun shooter; there are two versions -- one with the Guncon peripheral and one without. Using either control method, you'll blast your way through three stages, each with four areas filled with hired goons and vile boss characters. When the action stage begins, you'll start from a crouched position while enemy troops try and thwart your objective. While they're reloading, stand up and start spraying the area. You will have the option of crouching behind objects at anytime during gunfights. Just remember to keep your gun reloaded!

		<desc>In a future world, an army of steel robots are out to destroy the human race. Our only hope is a little yellow tank armed with some mighty big guns. The sentient Tiny Tank was originally created to appease a public that feared the mindless violence waged by larger war-robots, but he was soon destroyed by one of those jealous automatons at the beginning of the robot revolution 100 years ago. Almost destroyed, at least.
 Thanks to nano-technology, hundreds of microscopic "Fix-It Crabs" went to work and Tiny Tank was slowly rebuilt. Now he alone stands against the threat of the cruel MuTank and his deadly robot minions, who have all but erased human civilization from the planet's surface. The spunky little tank will need luck, strategy, and all the futuristic firepower he can get his treads on to save the human race.
 STORY:
 Sometime before 2094 A.D., all of Earth's armed forces were disintegrated into one large corporation, SenTrax. SenTrax vowed to create a robot army to fight humanity's wars, so mankind itself would not have to. However, they needed the peoples' vote to set this plan into motion, and thus developed the titular "Tiny Tank" - a small yellow tank with an occasionally unfriendly attitude. The creation of this cute killing machine made SenTrax's popularity skyrocket, and won them the vote. As thanks, the corporation set up an exhibition showing their yellow mascot fighting off the entire SenTrax army on July 4, 2094, broadcast live over the Internet. However, once the event began, one of the SenTrax robots had been accidentally fitted with live ammunition and destroyed Tiny with one shot. As a result, Tiny's "positronic brain" (his artificial intelligence system) shattered, and its shards gave "life" to the entire robot army. The robot that had fired the shot, now self-aware and calling himself Mutank, took control of the rampant robots and began to eliminate humanity so that machines could thrive. Humanity was forced to evacuate into underground asteroid shelters as the mechanical army conquered the surface.
 On July 4, 2194 A.D., exactly 100 years later, Tiny Tank was finally rebuilt thanks to automated SenTrax Fix-It Crabs, which were minuscule robots made to repair broken machinery. A female artificial intelligence on board an orbital satellite reawakened Tiny, and sent him to fight Mutank's robot army and save mankind.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Tiny Tank is a relatively straightforward third person shooter. The player controls Tiny as he traverses many</desc>

		<desc>Players head out for an adventure with the Tiny Toons gang in Tiny Toon Adventures: Plucky's Big Adventure for PlayStation. In this title, based on the Tiny Toons animated series kids can play as Plucky, Hamton, Buster and Babs as they explore twenty-plus levels of Acme Looniversity in search of parts for a time machine for Plucky. While avoiding the incorrigible Elmyra and Montana Max, players help the gang seek out the time machine parts in order for Plucky to travel back in time to finish his homework.
			Searching all over the Looniversity in Acme Acres, players explore many places including the music room, history room, tennis courts and hallways. Items will vary from a bicycle pump to a potato and once an item is found, players can proceed with the level or return to the controlling character's respective locker to store the item. Each character can carry only three items at one time and players must decide which items are the most useful for each current level. Certain items are not time machine parts but rather will be used to acquire parts later in the game.
			Elmyra and Montana Max, the game's only obstacles, must be avoided in order to complete the game. They can each capture the character they confront and will lock them away until another character rescues them. If they capture all four characters, the game is the over. Providing players can successfully avoid the antagonistic characters, and locate all the missing time machine parts, the game is won. The game also features a handful of other Tiny Toon characters such as Dizzy and GOGO with which the main characters interact.</desc>

		<desc>From the Warner Bros. animated series Steven Spielberg Presents TINY TOON ADVENTURES comes a point-and-click treasure hunt game for your PlayStation. Playing as Buster Bunny and Plucky Duck, Tiny Toon Adventures: The Great Beanstalk throws you into a wacky adventure full of zany twists, turns and falling cows. This fairy tale has you finding treasures that have been stolen by the Giant. Babs Bunny gives you clues to try to help you navigate the turns that the storyline takes, which promises a different adventure every time!
			In this game you must navigate through nine different adventures to get three keys for the Giant's castle, and retrieve the chicken that lays the golden egg, a bag full of gold and the magical flying golden harp. In each land, Babs Bunny will give you hints to find the three pieces that make up one complete key.
			Dropping anvils, exploding bombs and other hazards will knock you off The Great Beanstalk. To get up to higher beanstalks you must step on a button inserted in the stalk. Only when you have a complete key are you able to approach the castle door to retrieve the stolen goods. And to make it easier, The Great Beanstalk supports analog compatibility.</desc>

		<desc>In this adventure based on the Tiny Toon animated series, you must help Plucky, Hamton and Furball escape a haunted mansion. Each character has a purpose. Plucky and Hamton are there to navigate the mansion and provide comic relief, while Furball activates switches and devices.
 Since the characters aren't the bravest of souls, they may run away at certain times. Other problems include Bombats, flying creatures that come in several varieties. TNT Bombats, for example, have a short fuse and will explode on contact. All enemies can be eliminated in a series of "shooting" sequences within the mansion.
 Gameplay involves moving the characters through a series of rooms where they perform different actions, such as shooting, pulling switches, taking items, and opening doors. To successfully escape the mansion, the characters will need to retrieve power cells to activate the elevator on each of the five floors.
 Plucky, Hamton and Furball from the television cartoon Tiny Toon Adventures need to escape from the spooky haunted mansion of the evil Baroness Toonenstein (played by Elmyra) where she needs their brains to build a monster. The player moves Furball through numerous rooms looking for power cell actuators needed to activate the elevators on five floors while chased by different types of evil flying Bombats which explode if they touch him.
 When the Bombat Disabler Gun is found, the view changes to a stationary sniper mode and enemies can be shot with green goo. Furball can also open doors, activate levers, and take items such as codes to a treasure vault in the basement. There are different mini-games and puzzles to solve, in order to progress. Plucky and Hamton will sometimes be too frightened and run away, and must be located.</desc>

		<desc>TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4X4 simulates the sport of big truck racing rather than going with an Arcade format (like Midway's Off Road Challenge). This will require players to be on the lookout hazards in the road, pay attention to vehicle physics, choose trucks wisely, and adjust to various terrain and weather conditions.
 There are six different terrain/track locations -- Dynamite Pass, a mountainous setting of various terrain; Ground Zero Gulch, bumpy canyon driving; Devil's Kitchen, located in the dusty desert; Mercurial Forest, paved mountain roadways; Hades Highway, a volcano; and Arctic Inferno, a slippery ice capade. Depending on which track you happen to be on, you'll need to pick a truck well suited for the race. It would be pointless to take a rig built for winter driving when you're in the middle of the desert.
 Fortunately, there is a truck for every type of terrain (seven in all, one of which is hidden). If you're heading into Arctic Inferno, you'd probably be wise in choosing the Snow Spider -- a rig built with icy traction in mind. The Fire Witch is perfect for racing on hardened lava and the Sand Blaster rolls through sandy deserts like a knife through hot butter.
 Choosing the right truck really comes into play in the Championship mode of Hardcore 4X4. This is the main gameplay option; players will be facing off against five other trucks across each of the six tracks. The idea is to come in first on every track -- if you do, you'll reign as the champion! For the big rig masters, try the Championship mode on the Extreme difficulty; finish it and you'll unlock a new truck.
 There are two other options as well -- the Single Race and Time Trial. The Single Race is simply a race against five computer-controlled opponents and the Time Trial is a fierce competition for the fastest lap and finishing time on the given track. In the latter option, 8 people can compete for the glory -- the best times are then saved on your Memory Card.
 In addition to all this, TNN Motorsports Hardcore 4X4 comes equipped with three different difficulty levels (novice, pro, and extreme) and various weather conditions. You have the option of setting the weather to Good (normal conditions), Overcast (foggy conditions), and Severe (rain, snow, sandstorms, and smoke). Each setting effect tracks differently and will in someway interfere with your quest for glory (fog will hamper your vision, snow makes for messy driving, etc). There is also a day or night setting.

		<desc>As another addition to the off-road racing genre, TNN Motorsports HardCore TR features over 30 unique courses and 24 souped-up hotrods and all-terrain trucks customizable to your own preferences. Tracks span various locations throughout the United States ranging from the deserts and dirt trails of Arizona and the muddy swamps of Florida to the familiar wine valley landmarks of Northern California and the deep canyons of New Mexico.
 Held together by a map outlining race locations, the gameplay options include an Arcade, Championship, Player, Time Trial and Test Track modes. After making various modifications to your truck, you'll want to select the Test Track in order to see whether or not those changes positively or negatively affected your vehicle. Once your truck's handling and feel is to your liking, its time for some competition!
 The Championship mode spans four hardcore divisions beginning in the 4x4 Amateur Class; as you improve your driving skills, you'll move onto the Hotrod Amateur, 4x4 Pro and Hotrod Pro classes. Whereas the amateur classes (only readily available seasons upon startup) are five races long, the professional brackets span 10 different tracks. Your objective is to finish each division with the most points. Points are awarded by finishing in a top position: first place awards 10 points; second gives you six; and third hands out four. If you're successful in the amateur seasons, you'll be placed into the professional season where the competition is much tougher.
 If you'd rather not deal with points and qualifying, the Arcade mode allows you to immediately jump into the action. You'll start in a designated location and unlock different locations by finishing in first place. By doing well in all the Arcade races, you'll not only unlock the various tracks but also bonus trucks available for your choosing. The Time Trial has you in a heated competition against the clock for the ultimate lap times.
 TNN Motorsports Hardcore TR also features a multi-player Player mode that pits you and another human opponent in a split-screen battle. The game supports analog control for unprecedented handling, the vibration function and a memory card for saving game data and modifications. There are also weather effects such as rain, snow and foggy conditions.

		<desc>Tobal No. 1 is a fighting game for the PlayStation developed by DreamFactory and published by Square in 1996. The game was DreamFactory's first release, as well as Square's first release on the CD-based console.
 Tobal No. 1 marks Square's incursion into the fighting game genre, although an adventure-like quest mode is part of the game. The game's mechanics were designed with the aid of fighter game designer Seiichi Ishii, while all the characters were designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame. The sequel, Tobal 2, was never released in North America and Europe.
 Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a sampler disc featuring a pre-release demo of Final Fantasy VII and video previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and SaGa Frontier.
 STORY:
 Tobal No. 1 takes place in the year 2027 on a fictional planet called Tobal, which has large deposits of Molmoran, an ore that can be used as an energy source. The planet's 98th tournament is held to determine who has the rights to the ore. A number of humans and aliens compete for the title. The game's plot and character backstories are only explored in the instruction manual. All of the initial eight playable characters receive the same ending.
 The game's immediately playable characters include Chuji Wu, Oliems, Epon, Hom, Fei Pusu, Mary Ivonskaya, Ill Goga, and Gren Kutz. Bosses include Nork, Mufu, and the emperor Udan. All bosses are unlockable after defeating them in Dungeon Mode except Nork. Instead, the game allows the player to select Snork (Small Nork), a pint-sized version of the very large character. There is also one secret fighter named Toriyama Robo (named for Akira Toriyama) who is unlockable if the player can complete the 30-floor Udan's Dungeon level in the quest mode. Toriyama Robo is not seen at any point in the game except at the very end of the dungeon.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Tobal No. 1 has various gameplay modes including a tournament mode, two player versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the same fighting system. The game itself runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time, such as Tekken 2. The game's controls are unique in that they allow full freedom of movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has the ability to dash and jump, and certain b</desc>

		<desc>Touring Car Challenge: TOCA 2 is the sequel to TOCA Championship Racing. Rather than focusing on traditional racing elements, Codemasters has taken the mechanics and structure of British Touring Car Championship and slapped it into a PlayStation CD. Because of this, the TOCA series is considered a niche racing game; something on the outskirts of the mainstream.</desc>

		<desc>The British Touring Car Championship represented the worldwide peak of saloon car racing in the mid 1990s, attracting factory support from Audi, Renault, Ford, Volvo and several other constructors. In this game you can choose from all official teams and drivers of the 1997 season, won by Renault's Alain Menu. 

All the circuits are also included. The cars have a realistic damage model, so they can loose specific parts like bumpers or mirrors. The weather effects are also very realistic. Car handling is designed to be tough but realistic.</desc>

		<desc>It's time to experience the mishaps and adventures of Tom and Jerry's bitter rivalry. Tom and Jerry in House Trap is a split screen action adventure for one or two players. Fight your way through the pages of Jerry's new book "My Life With Tom" and follow them through all the rooms in the house finding ways to knock the other out.
			As defiant mouse Jerry, single-players move about the house setting traps for Tom the cat. As Jerry continues to set traps in one half of the split screen, players can watch the results in the other half of the screen as Tom falls victim to (or outsmarts) the traps that have already been set. If Jerry notices that Tom seems to be getting a little too close for comfort, he can also blow his dog whistle and Spike will come to chase after Tom and even the odds a bit.
			When two people play at once, one can take on the role of Tom and help him to avoid the traps that Jerry sets. The game features 15 different rooms to explore, each with its own challenges and rewards, and each successive level unlocks a new room in the house with more weapons scattered throughout. While most of the challenges involve reducing the other player's health first, some levels require rubber duckies be collected and placed in a pond. The first player to collect the required amount wins the match.
			Both Tom and Jerry have limited health that is represented by a green status bar, and can be drained by hitting them with umbrellas, cooking pans, ladles, and hammers (to name a few). Some objects, such as cakes, anvils and bottles can be thrown at the other character, while others like bombs and Jell-o molds can be dropped in their path.
			Help Jerry prove that cats aren't as smart as they look, or make Tom the envy of all the local cats by bringing Jerry in.</desc>

		<desc>Using a Tom Clancy storyline and characters, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for the PlayStation is an original first person 3D shooter where you take control of an elite counter-terrorist organization named Rainbow Six. After selecting one of three difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate or Special Forces), you select a team of operatives from a full roster. You can also equip your team with the appropriate weapons and equipment based on real-life munitions (even in Sniper Mode).
 To further realism you can select where each team member begins. After planning, lead your team into the mission where you get to control each member, one at a time. Also, as in real life, one shot may often maim or kill your operatives. If all of your operatives are killed, your mission ends. You must then choose to either move on with new operatives or retry the mission.
 If you complete all of your objectives you move on to the next mission for a total of 14 different missions in real world locations. In addition to the regular missions, you are also given the option to train. In the training level you can practice controlling an operative in a non-threatening environment. This is where you really get to learn some important skills. There is an assault course, a shooting range, and a training mission.
 Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six includes many real-life weapons. They include guns, grenades and kits. Some guns include: the HK MP5A2, the preferred submachine gun of counter-terrorist operatives around the world; the CAR-15, a compact M-16; and the Benelli M1, a good tactical shotgun that is an essential weapon for many teams. Other weapons include Frag Grenades, Heartbeat Sensors and Demolition Kits.
 Uniforms are another essential piece of equipment for counter-terrorists. Some include the ever-popular light, medium and heavy uniforms, the desert uniform, and the Camo uniform -- all used in different environments. The game also features real time lighting and special effects for ultimate realism.</desc>

In keeping with the "Lone Wolf" mode of Rainbow Six assignments, missions are conducted without the help or hindrance of teammates. Planning phases include briefing, intelligence, kit select, and map screens, while actual gameplay takes place from a first-person perspective.
 Weapons can be set to fully automatic (continuous), burst (three shots), or semi-automatic (one shot). Crosshair and auto-locking features provide concise control when aiming, though grenades can be used in situations requiring less precise targeting. The mission objectives, a health meter, mini-map, the currently selected weapon, and ammo status are displayed on-screen at all times. Other features in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Lone Wolf include a choice of insertion points for each mission (with different advantages), night vision goggles, and an option to save after successfully completing each mission.

The best plans are designed to accomplish all objectives as quickly and efficiently as possible. Once the decisions have been made, the team moves out. Each operative behaves according to the orders defined in the plan. The player can also control each team member from a first-person perspective, to guide the operative around unforeseen obstacles.and provide a more intimate experience of the action.

		<desc>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact.

Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</desc>

		<desc>The story of Tomb Raider II surrounds the mythical Dagger of Xian, a weapon which was used by an Emperor of China to command his army. By plunging the weapon into its owner's heart, the weapon has the power to turn its bearer into a dragon. A flashback reveals that the last battle which was fought with the Dagger ended in defeat when the warrior monks of Tibet succeeded in removing the knife from the Emperor's heart. The Dagger was then returned to its resting place within the Great Wall.</desc>

		<desc>The amazing adventurer Lara Croft returns once again with the third release in the Tomb Raider series for the PlayStation, Tomb Raider III: The Adventures of Lara Croft. This time she has some new moves such as crawl, monkey swing, and speed dash to help her through tough situations.
			The story unfolds with some background on the current situation. In years past, British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they looted four artifacts found with the meteor. One of these sailors kept a journal as they headed back to England -- he was the only one to make it home alive.
			With that in mind, the game begins with several key elements falling into place that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers.
			It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power.
			Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail, improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting effects.
			The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any part of the adventure.</desc>

		<desc>Aside from sporting a wacky pink hairdo, Tomba! offers a long and brain twisting experience that mixes the traditional 2D side scrolling action/platformer with the elements of a role-playing game. The game starts out simple enough with the evil Koma Pigs stealing Tomba's bracelet, which was given to him by his grandfather. You assume the role of Tomba and begin your adventure. Little do you know that the quest for your bracelet will turn into so much more.

Because of its role-playing elements, in Tomba!, your character will gain experience points, develop new skills and learn new things. He has seven abilities that can be learned throughout the duration of the game. Once all three experience meters reach level ten (in order to do this, Tomba must do certain things), he will unlock and learn an ability.</desc>

		<desc>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 features the series' trademark open-ended gameplay, in which the player (playing as a professional skateboarder) completes a number of tasks which result in cash rewards. With money gained, the player can then purchase skill improvements and better skateboards. THPS2 was also the first game in the series to introduce the manual, a skateboarding trick where the performer balances on two wheels. This enables players to string together trick combos. The game also introduced the Noseslide, Tailslide, Bluntslide, Nosebluntside, Feeble, and Overcrook grinds. It was also the first of the Pro Skater games to feature Create-a-Skater and Park Editor features, now staples in the series.</desc>

		<desc>With this release of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3, one of the most universally popular and financially successful game franchises in recent memory returns home to roost on the original PlayStation console that launched the peerless extreme sports series in the autumn of 1999. Though this third version of the title is being released on half a dozen platforms and considerable effort has been invested in assuring that the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of the live up to their "next-generation" technological potential, Neversoft and Activision endeavored to bless this PS version with all of the third edition's key innovations while retaining and reinforcing the engaging, accessible gameplay which is the true crux of the series' success.

While it can't pump out the same amount of eye-candy as its counterparts on the 128-bit generation systems, this PlayStation release of THPS3 incorporates several of the new features designed to propel the series' popularity on other platforms. New landing tricks allow players to string together greater combinations, especially when moving from the ramps to the street. Environments are designed to test old and new skills alike. Loyal PS gamers should be pleased that all the important new levels, tricks, and combinations developed for the third edition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater are duly represented in this version of the game.</desc>

		<desc>The fourth game in Activision and Neversoft's seminal skateboarding series is designed to bring additions and refinements to the already polished gameplay that's made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater one of the most important video game franchises of its time. Many of these improvements are in line with advances made in earlier THPS sequels, while others may come as a surprise to longtime fans of the series.

Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The "spine transfer" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other. Players will trick off of moving cars and other interactive elements of the game's diverse levels with new finesse.</desc>

		<desc>In the vein of Top Gun and Namco's acclaimed Air Combat comes Top Gun: Fire at Will! Players will assume the role of an up and coming hotshot pilot named Maverick and guide him through the Top Gun training academy. After acquiring the necessary skills, you'll begin a tour of duty with the Navy and be assigned top priority air missions!
 As a fighter pilot, you'll carry out a barrage of missions set throughout Mimar, Cuba, Korea, and Libya. Commander Honda, played by James Tolkan, will be acting as the assigning officer -- screw up and he'll gnaw on your butt and spit it out! Missions include search and destroy operations, protecting ally planes and important people, and good old-fashioned dogfights with enemy MiGs.
 Players will be manning the F-14 fighter plane. Not only does this baby come with all the necessary tools and equipment needed for survival (radar, warning lights, altitude meters), it comes with a variety of missiles; there are standard air-to-air missiles, the air-to-ground AGMs, U238s made from depleted uranium, a disastrous Nuke, and the multiple target MIRV. It also comes with some defensive tools such as chaffs and flares that trick enemy radar.
 Don't worry, you're not going in the air alone! Merlin will act as your Radar Intercept Officer; loosely translated, he's the guy that sits behind you and watches out for enemy target locks. Additionally, the sweetly calm Raven and your arch rival Stinger will assist Maverick as his wingmen. When you get in a sticky situation, count on these guys to help you out!
 Top Gun: Fire at Will features a single-player Campaign mode and an Options menu. The Options menu lets players select a difficulty level (trainee, pilot, and ace) as well as sound and music levels and various controller configurations. The Campaign is the real deal; this is where you'll be taking mission objectives and flying in the not-so-friendly skies.
 If you think you've got what it takes to blast some MiG fighter planes out of the sky, step up to the challenge in this custom PlayStation version of Top Gun: Fire at Will! On the strong of mind, intelligence, and cunning need apply.</desc>

 Find arrows, clubs, swords, shields, staves, safes, scrolls, pots, herbs, bread and rings so that Torneko can heal and defend himself, and make sure to keep Torneko well fed with bread or he'll lose strength.

 Features:
 * Help the portly Torneko break his village's curse by entering randomly generated dungeons
 * Battle more than 130 creatures from the Dragon Warrior series

An enemy is significantly damaged by a single trap, but one may create a sequence of traps for a devastating amount of damage.

With one of six different special agents, each a specialist in assassination and demolitions, a player may progress through a story mode consisting of several missions, a sub-boss, and a final boss. These characters are also available for custom battles against a human or the computer.</desc>

The player controls an underwater explorer and ex-Navy Seal Jack Runyan, who is approached by the Underwater Mercenary Agency to carry out highly dangerous missions. The risks are great but the rewards are even greater. 

Choose from 12 missions in all parts of the globe, from the Great Barrier Reef to the Bermuda Triangle. Eight ships await command; start with an USN RV-1 mini-sub and trade up to the deadly Viper attack submarine. An arsenal of underwater technology and weaponry aid you in the quest: steel-mesh wetsuits, night-vision goggles, homing torpedoes, and remote underwater robot vehicles are just some of the resources at the player's disposal. And each of them is needed to be prepared for the unknown dangers lurking in the deep. 

The game has realistic graphics showing an incredible diorama of undersea life and views of forgotten wrecks and Aztec ruins.</desc>

		<desc>Fresh off the slopes comes Capcom's Trick'N Snowboarder exclusively for the PlayStation. It features a wide variety of distinctive and realistically designed courses ranging from two different half-pipes and a snowboard park to Alpine courses and a large jump ramp specifically used for stunts and tricks. There are also a few hidden goodies/tracks waiting to be unlocked!
 In addition to the various tracks, there are a few different gameplay options including the Scenario, Versus, Edit, and Free modes. The Scenario mode has the player assuming the role of an up and coming snowboarding star. After joining the Extreme Tour, he sets off an adventure of fame and fortune; players travel around the world competing in various tournaments while gathering material for a snowboarding video.
 Winning competitions and getting good footage will depend on the player's ability to perform exciting stunts and tricks. Everything found in the actual sport of snowboarding has been included; players are able to execute 360s, grab, and flip their snowboard. Don't confine yourself to just one aerial maneuver -- mix them up and keep the stunts interesting!
 When players aren't filming their movie and trying to get extraordinary stunts on film, other challenges await. The Versus mode pits two players in a heated one-on-one battle for ultimate snowboarding supremacy. Played from either a horizontal or split screen viewpoint, the object is to either get more points than your friend or finish a course in the quickest amount of time.
 For the creative types, Capcom included an Edit mode in which players may customize any given snowboarder. Don't like the clothing and/or color scheme? Change them! Think that character would look better with a different brand of snowboard? Roll with it -- it's up to you and your imagination! The customized snowboarder can then be used in any of the gameplay options including a Free mode in which players are given absolute freedom to practice courses and/or tricks.
 Trick'N Snowboarder supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller by incorporating both analog control and the vibration function into gameplay. Players may also utilize a Memory Card for saving data, Scenario mode progression and customized snowboarders.</desc>

		<desc>Electronic Arts' fourth baseball game on PlayStation features 30 authentic Major League Baseball teams and over 700 players with ratings based on the 1998 season. Four game modes include "Single Game," "Home Run Challenge," "Season," and "Playoffs." All 30 ballparks have been modeled after their real-life counterparts, and games can be played at night, dusk, or during the day. In-game commentary is provided by Buck Martinez and Jim Hughson.
 Two viewpoints are available during the game: batting from the catcher's perspective and fielding from a view above the diamond or outfield. Both offer three camera angles to further customize the perspective. Also featured is an "action" camera that shows TV-style cut-scenes while the ball is in play. Team management options include trades, substitutions, custom players, free agents, adjustable rotations or lineups, and multiple defensive formations. The PlayStation version adds a fantasy draft option not available in the Nintendo 64 game.

		<desc>This is the first edition of the new millennium for Electronic Arts' storied baseball franchise. As in previous versions, all the major league teams and their players are present along with all 30 big league parks, each recreated using real-time lighting and enhanced sounds; new stadiums such as San Francisco's Pac Bell Park are there too.
 Every player is also modeled as closely as possible after their real life counterpart, even down to their own batting stances and pitching styles. Brand new animations such as arguments with umpires, high-fives, end-of-game celebrations and player reactions to strikeouts and homers also help bring the game to life.
 Gamers who really want to immerse themselves in the experience can try out the brand new Behind the Fielder view. Now they can put themselves in the shoes of a fielder and see how easy it is to snare a line drive or scoop up a tough grounder. Perhaps they'll even stop yelling during real games every time the home team makes an error.
 As an added bonus, EA has secured exclusive rights to the 500 Home Run Club, which means that gamers can step up to the plate as Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron or others, and take on today's top pitchers like Pedro Martinez or Randy Johnson. In addition, EA has exclusive rights to the MLBPA Big League Challenge, which is set in Las Vegas' Cashman Field. Big League Challenge Mode features 12 ballplayers from among the greatest of all time new and old in a variety of competitions such as a home run contest and target hitting (Extreme mode).
 Gamers can go for an exhibition or a season with the chance to play multiple seasons in Career Mode, complete with a draft and a system which allots points to each player and a points cap per team; gamers have to use their best roster management skills to work within those confines. Smart trades which allow CPU-controlled teams to make trade offers to each other and the gamers' teams are new this year.
 As in EA's Madden NFL series, there are plenty of goodies to unlock such as hidden players and stadiums, power-ups (Strong Arm, Big Head, CPU Assist, etc.) and bonus teams. When the usual stadiums get old, you can head on over to a construction yard, a living room, or even a castle.
 The Sony PlayStation version supports analog and Dual Shock controls as well as memory cards for saving season and career statistics. This game is for two players.</desc>

		<desc>Triple Play Baseball is part of the EA Sports line of MLB Baseball sims. This edition was released in 2001 and would have been called Triple Play 2002 if they had not dropped the year off the title.
 Like previous editions you can pick from any of the teams in the National League or American League. Mostly little has changed with this edition except for a world tournament that has been added. You have to win the World Series however to see this option.
 The EA Sports' well respected series of baseball games returns in this release for the hardy PlayStation console. As in previous incarnations, gamers can control nearly all aspects of the Big League action, which takes place in virtual representations of real-life baseball venues and features all of the Major League teams, players, and updated statistics from the 2000 season.
 Features:
 Includes teams, stadiums, and rosters from the 2001 season
 Paint the corners by mastering the timing-based pitching meter

		<desc>While the old adage that "turnabout is fair play" applies in many situations, Natsume's Turnabout is all about diabolical puzzles where players rotate the entire puzzle while the pieces move within its borders, sliding and rolling into mind-numbing configurations and patterns. The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.
 Puzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen "steps," even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit Mode.
 Features:
 * One hundred puzzles with moving balls and sliding blocks
 * Create up to 50 additional custom puzzles in edit mode
 * Background, sound, and music options allow customization of playing fields</desc>

		<desc>Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on the no-holds-barred martial art tournament of the same name. What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer.

The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early.

There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.</desc>

		<desc>Introducing Lammy, a totally rockin' guitarist.  In day-to-day life, she's quite timid, shy, and wimpy - but put a guitar in her hands, and she'll blow you away!  Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell.

In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan - the coolest, hippest band ever!  While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally, each button controls a different note on the guitar.  Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe.  The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance.

Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways.  Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend.  Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively.  If you don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner.  After finishing the initial game, PaRappa also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps instead of Lammy's guitar.</desc>

		<desc>Uprising X is a PlayStation-exclusive entry in Cyclone Studios' series of tank simulators, combining the gameplay of real time strategy games with first-person combat. The player controls a tank named "Wraith" with both analog sticks, using the left one to aim and the right stick for movement. The minimal plot is developed through mission briefings and cutscenes, telling the struggle between a rebel faction against imperial forces for the dominance of planets.

As one of the rebels, the player has to maneuver the tank on a battlefield, searching for suitable places to construct reinforcements buildings. After entering a piece of terrain marked with four glowing orbs, a large structure topped by a turret called "The Citadel" appears on a nearby spot. The player can enter it by pressing both L1 and R1 buttons, assuming the role of the turret operator. Besides handling the weapons, the player can access the build menu, from where unit factories can be erected on the surrounding terrain. Extra turrets can also be placed around the perimeter to protect the base. The structures can be recycled to be replaced with new ones.

The tank is equipped with several weapons, from laser beams to guided missiles, that can be used against enemy troops. From the inside, friendly units can be summoned when available to fight alongside in battle. Infantry, tanks and aircraft can be called into action from the interface menu. A tactical map showing an overhead view of the terrain can be activated with the select button.

There are three split-screen modes for two players: challenge, deathmatch and siege. The first two have the players fighting directly against each other, while the last one is more strategic, where the objective is to defend the base from incoming enemy assaults.</desc>

		<desc>As the 2nd millennium ends, the cities are over-ran with Apocalyptic violence. Is this down to urban frustrations, or a sinister cult controlling everybody? You are either cop D'Arcy Stern or former soldier Roper McIntyre, and have to find the answers, but more importantly put a stop to the carnage. 

This involves a succession of action-packed non-linear missions. The environment incorporates shadows, rain, fog and a day/night cycle. Police cars, motorcycles and ambulances must be controlled during some missions. There are many ways to 'settle' the enemies - car chases, hand-to-hand combats and action movie-style shoot outs for example.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the syndicated series starring Pamela Anderson, V.I.P. for the PlayStation offers a mixture of first-person shooting action and hand-to-hand combat. The female bodyguard team led by Vallery Irons is entangled in a mob vendetta while protecting their client Dr. Kindle. After Irons and Kindle are captured, the rest of the team must advance through a series of indoor and outdoor levels to rescue them. Featured characters include ex-spy Tasha Dexter, explosives expert Nikki Franco, former boxer Quick Williams, martial arts specialist Johnny Loh, and computer hacker Kay Simmons.

Fighting sequences are controlled differently than in traditional fighting games, as players perform combination attacks by inputting a series of onscreen commands. If the sequence is entered within the time frame, the character will carry out the moves and damage the enemy. Play then continues until all the enemies in a level are defeated. The shooting stages are structured in a manner similar to Lethal Enforcers or Time Crisis, with players guiding a cross-hair target on the screen to shoot down enemies. Ten mini-games are also available in between missions, offering a variety of timed puzzles to complete before advancing to the next stage.</desc>

		<desc>Valendra is a land that had undergone civil war. The end of which had birthed the parliament and several organizations to control the balance of power. Ashley Riot is a Riskbreaker agent, an elite one man investigator, for the Valendia Knights of Peace (VKP) who is investigating some strange occurrences. A cult of religious fanatics known as Müllenkamp, and their leader Sydney Losstarot, have seized the manor of Duke Bardorba of Valendia Kingdom. The events at the manor have sent Ashley on a quest to get to the bottom of what's going on, and travel into the catacombs that lead to the destroyed, yet magical city of Leá Monde. However Ashley is not the only person interested in the city, and other factions of the government, including parliament assigned Knights of the Crimson Blade and other VKP agents are pursuing their own agenda. 

Combat is central to the game. The game runs in real time but when entering combat and attacking an enemy, the game is paused. A wireframe sphere showing the range of the currently selected weapon and detailed statistics on different body parts of the enemies within range.

The game features a range of weapons. Each weapon can be disassembled and reassembled in workshops scattered throughout the game, attaching gems for extra power. Weapons used constantly against the same type of enemy improve in power against them.

Ashley can also make use of Magic, Chain Abilities and Break Arts. Magic is broken into four groups, namely defense, combat, healing and status. Spells use up mana points and are sometimes more costly than useful. Chain Abilities allow Ashley to "chain together" consecutive hits against enemies. Break Arts are special skills learnt after repetitive use of a weapon type. Sacrificing some of the player's health, Break Arts can perform a high damage attack on an enemy.</desc>

		<desc>In preparation for Ragnarok, the final battle between the gods, Odin has commanded Lenneth the Valkyrie to descend to the lower world and gather the souls of fallen heroes to serve as soldiers in the approaching conflict. You play as Lenneth, gathering soldiers and training them to be transferred to the battlefields of the gods.

The gameplay mainly consists of exploring various locations (dungeons, mansions, swamps) from a 2D perspective. Lenneth can run, jump, shoot ice crystals (useful for anything from freezing enemies to building ledges), push and pull objects to solve simple puzzles, etc. All of the enemies are on-screen and can usually be avoided, in the style of games like Chrono Cross and SaGa Frontier 2. The battle system is a mix of real-time and turn-based elements. Each of the characters (up to three can fight alongside Lenneth at a time) is assigned to one of the four main keys. The player and the enemy take turns attacking, but with the right timing, the player can execute combos that leave enemies defenseless. Long combos can result in substantial experience bonuses, although it is possible to defeat most enemies without them.

The rest of the game consists of Lenneth using "spiritual concentration" to discover the locations of dungeons and fallen heroes, ingame-engine cutscenes that give the history of these characters, and reports about the war's progress that come at the end of each "chapter". The chapter system is one of the game's most original features. Each chapter (there are about 8) is made up of a preset number of periods. Each action, such as a successful use of spiritual concentration, or entering a town/dungeon, uses a number of periods that varies with the difficulty level. When all of the periods have passed, the chapter is over. Since the player must transfer heroes to Valhalla in the course of each chapter (permanently losing them), but has only a limited amount of time to improve their statistics, the game has a sense of urgency and danger often absent from more traditional console RPGs.</desc>

		<desc>Vampire Hunter D for the PlayStation is based on the anime titled Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust.  That anime is based on the novel title Vampire Hunter D: Demon Deathchase written by Hideyuki Kikuchi.  You play as D, the half-human / half-vampire whose sole mission in life is to hunt down and kill vampires.  The setting is not the distant medieval past, nor is it the mid-19th century, instead D's adventures are set in the far distant future, when humanity has nearly killed itself off by endless wars.  Rising from the scorched earth and assuming power in this desolate era are the timeless vampires.  They established a feudal system where they ruled over humans as nobles in Europe ruled over their peasants.  But after thousands of years the Vampires' power waned and humans revolted against their lords, and thus the class of Vampire Hunters were born.

In this particular story, D is employed by a rich family to retrieve their daughter from the vampire who kidnapped her.  He is not the only one trying to free her; a rival group of vampire hunters, the Marcus Brothers, are after the daughter and the bounty, regarding D as a rival.  The Vampire Hunter D must enter Castle Chaith, battle the Vampire Lord, the minions that inhabit the castle, and a hidden evil, to save the girl and collect his bounty.

The action in Vampire Hunter D plays like the early Resident Evil games for the PlayStation.  There are pre-rendered backgrounds and all the characters are animated in 3D.  Players utilize D's signature weapon, his massive long sword, as well as his special vampire powers, (which comprise healing, offensive, and defensive powers), to battle the hordes of evil creatures that live in the hallways and chambers of the daemonic Castle Chaith.  You must solve puzzles, unlock doors, and retrieve key items to progress into the depths and heights of the castle, ultimately reaching and revealing the true evil power pulling the strings of this macabre story.</desc>

It's a tried-and-true method of laying on the action, and while there were plenty of opportunities for Asmik to screw up the formula, but luckily, they never really dropped the ball, at least not when it came to the shooter parts.</desc>

		<desc>Vandal Hearts is a turn-based strategy RPG. It follows a fixed plot-line with set battles, focusing more on strategic elements than adventure elements. 

The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas).

In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.</desc>

		<desc>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series.

Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.

The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.</desc>

		<desc>Vanishing Point is an arcade-style racing game that revolves around unlocking cars and tracks by progressing through tournament heats. As the game begins, the only available cars are a Ford Mustang Cobra SVT or Ford Explorer, and there's only one track on which to race. But earning first-place finishes unlocks additional tracks, cars like the Audi TT, BMW 325i and Dodge Viper GTS, and extra features such as the Tune-Up Shop.
 The other major feature of the game is Stunt Driver mode, which consists of a series of timed challenges like jumps and slalom courses. The faster you complete each challenge, the most stunt points you receive to go towards unlocking additional stunts. Single Race and Time Trial modes are also available.
 The only initially playable two-player mode is Single Race, but two additional challenges called Balloon Buster and Chicken can be unlocked. Balloon Buster has you racing on a track filled with colored balloons. Popping balloons of your color subtracts a second from your time, while popping an opponent's adds two seconds. Chicken pits two racers on a track going in opposite directions.
 Three or more players can compete in League play or Winner Stays On (in which the winner keeps racing as long as they keep winning), and four or eight players can compete in the tournament-like Knockout mode. The Internet Challenge lets you create an online profile and see how you rank against other players by competing in online-specific challenges. This mode does not include head-to-head racing over the Internet.
 Features:
 * Race against the clock on urban roads, avoiding traffic and competitors
 * Unlock cars, slideshows, movies and items by winning races</desc>

		<desc>Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter, released in 1992 by SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade platform. By default, 1P and 2P can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled.
 The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same.
 Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.
 One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.
 Viewpoint features six robot riddled worlds set throughout a three-quarter perspective. Growing in complexity as the game progresses, the levels have been rendered with computer-generated SGI textures, enemies, and various explosion effects. At the end of certain levels, players will square off against large mechanized bosses.
 Far into the future of mankind's existence, the world is being threatened by its own mechanical creations. After being banished to the 31st sector of the galaxy, the Ralfedacc has began orbiting around Earth. Those in the death orb more commonly known as the Director of the Dark have created destructive robots that will be deployed on the seemingly helpless planet; their ultimate objective is revenge.
 Naturally, you've been selected as the Byupo probe pilot that will save the world; no pressure, eh? A Byupo is a small yet powerful fighter ship capable of mass devastation; it can pick up and use various weapons and utilize special items. Your mission objective is short and to the point: pilot your craft with a quick trigger finger throughout six key battle areas.
 The Byupo can obtain sidecars, or helper items and/or weapons, during each levels.

		<desc>Take the law into your own hands. This game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage, except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by 5 hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the U.S. to its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of Vigilantes, lead by the truck driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding.

 Want to bring a friend along for the ride? You're in luck, Vigilante 8: Second Offense offers up a two player split screen cooperative mode in addition to the traditional VS mode. Cooperative action is split off into two separate options in of itself.

Two players at once will still be able to save or load their customized cars and weapons/improvements and scores with separate memory cards so you an get into some high powered blasting action that way.
 Your car is customizable and will develop over the course of a game. As you destroy enemy cars, you'll gain upgrade points that'll make your car go faster, take more hits, and the usual assortment of things a car under combat conditions will need. If you max out a stat, you'll get a better part. If you max all the categories out, you'll get a new chassis for your car. During the course of a level you'll be able to pick up special propulsion mechanisms in addition to the usual shield and weapon power ups. You'll be able to nab Hoverpods for all terrain action, Hydrofloaters for those times when you need your car to not sink in water, and skis N' treads for those stubborn icy levels.
 Now get in there 'pard, and get ready to shoot first and ask questions later.
 Features:
 Choose from 18 modern and '70s era vehicles

		<desc>After a successful debut on the PC, Virtual Pool comes home to the PlayStation! Featuring realistic pool angles and physics, it is usable as not only a game, but as a teaching tool for novice players. Outlined further in the manual, players are able to learn and master ball throwing, spin transfers, carom shots, bank shots, and spinning English shots.
 Played from a 360-degree rotational 3D viewpoint, Virtual Pool gives players the ability to walk around the table to check out their next shot and take a closer look at ball positions. You can zoom around the table, look left or right, and even check out an overhead view from above, something unavailable in a real pool game. Once the cue ball is lined up in accordance with the wanted shot, fire away!
 Virtual Pool features a few different pool games including 8-Ball, 9-Ball, Straight Pool, and Rotation. Each game features realistically designed ruling systems and objectives: the objective of 8-Ball is to sink seven striped or solid balls and then the eight ball; 9-Ball has players sinking the lowest numbered ball; Straight Pool is a points based game; and Rotation crowns the winner at 61 points. Fouls result in disqualifications, lost turns, and the deduction of points.
 World Champion pool player "Machine Gun" Lou Butera offers his skills and techniques to make you a better pool player! He offers random tips including how to hold the cue stick, how much spin to use on a shot, and other general knowledge facts. Butera will also teach players over thirty famous trick shots designed to impress your friends!</desc>

There are 44 international teams to choose from with 22 players on each squad. Each player is rated according to statistics such as vision, accuracy, power, pace, discipline, control, and flair. You can use your bench throughout the game, bringing in new players with the desired skills.
 There are two basic styles of play: arcade and simulation. The arcade mode relies depends very little on player stats and gets you straight to soccer action. The simulation mode relies more on strategy, forcing you to try and put together a group of guys who will help win you some games. Either style of play is available for use in a friendly game, league play, or the cup mode, which is a single-elimination tournament.

Powerboat Racing, published under Interplay's VR Sports brand, is a game that has you racing a high-performance speedboat against a number of computer opponents.
 The game sports a number of modes, from the normal arcade mode, where players compete against computer-controlled racers in a number of locales, including New York, Nevada, Japan, Norway, England, Australia, England, Monaco, the Amazon and Russia.
 Players receive points for their overall finish, and can advance to the next round of competition if they earn enough points. There's also a shoot-out mode, where a player can pick a location and have a five-lap race against a computer-controlled player. The time trial mode allows players to try to beat their previous best lap times.
 The challenge mode allows a player to challenge the computer's best time against a ghost racer, and there's the all-purpose practice mode which allows you to perfect those twists and turns on each course. Of course, there is also a multiplayer mode, allowing you to race a friend on a split screen, so you can finally prove complete dominance. Get ready for some wet and wild racing!</desc>

The fighter under your control can perform many different moves, and string those moves together to perform "combos."  Furthermore, the fighters all have special "finishing moves" that eliminate your opponent in some gruesome manner at the end of a match.  There are 10 different fighters to choose from, all based on different ancient civilizations.

The graphics in War Gods are fairly unique. They were created by texture-mapping 3D character models with digitized photos of people.  This gives them a reasonably lifelike look.</desc>

The main objective is to take control of one race and wipe the other one completely off of the map.
 The console version of Warcraft II sports some changes from its PC predecessor. First and foremost, both the original version of Warcraft II as well as the expansion pack are included. This means twice as many maps and four separate campaigns, giving players 52 different missions split between the races. Other additions include six new full-motion video cut-scenes, and the ability to group sixteen units instead of nine. Also included are extra production options, meaning that if you control multiple bases, it will be easier to maintain one while focusing your attention on the other.
 While Warcraft II: The Dark Saga only features single-player missions, players can create their own maps, as well as use custom mission maps that the game includes to make their own scenarios.</desc>

		<desc>The player gets to play as NORAD or WOPR. According to the game's cover box, the story takes place 20 years after the film: WOPR attempts to exterminate humanity and NORAD tried to stop it. During a mission the player takes control of a vehicle and can change the controls of any vehicle the team has - for example, while NORAD has heavily armored and armed tanks and aircraft, WOPR possesses exotically futuristic mechs and hovercraft. Vehicles could recharge ammo by obtaining powers. A unique feature in the game allows the player to command their team to send resupply on ammos or repair damage units. The game allows the player to command teammates to attack or follow the player's main vehicle.</desc>

		<desc>Warhammer: Shadow of the Horned Rat offers over 25 different troop types, 20 spells and nine characteristics for each regiment: movement, weapon skill, ballistic skill, strength, toughness, wounds, initiative, attack and leadership ability. In order to save campaign progress, players must have a memory card with at least one block free.

Battles consist of two phases: deployment and real-time fighting. Deployment allows you to position your regiments within an area designated by white flags. This involves turning them to face certain enemies, issuing orders to attack, move (including setting waypoints and patrol loops) or simply hold ground.

Combat involves charging the enemy, using magical spells (if available) or firing long-range weapons, such as arrows or catapults. Of course, line of sight and terrain will influence how successful your attacks are, and the emotion level (fear, hatred or frenzy) as well as the experience of your troops will also play a significant role. Each battlefield can also hold various magic items that may help in future battles.</desc>

		<desc>Warhawk is an action/simulation game built around a futuristic VTOL craft. The player maneuvers with 360 degrees of flight control through 6 unique levels.
 Take to the skies over desert and volcanic planets, through ancient castles and towers, and against massive airships in WarHawk. As a member of the Strikeforce Omicron, your goal is to wipe out the aggressive forces of Kreel. You will have complete 360 degree movement over large 3D worlds as you evade or attack in any direction: reverse, bank left or right, dive, barrel-roll, perform loops or even use the Immelmann turn to blast enemies out of the sky.
 Fire deadly lock-on missiles, rockets, multi-fire swarmers, plasma cannons and more to take down enemy ships and ground units. An orchestral soundtrack will set the mood while you engage in dogfights, and four different camera angles (cockpit, near chase, far chase and a cinema-style view) let you customize the action as you see fit. In total, there are over 25 areas of combat set within six zones: Desert Zone, Canyon Zone, Airship Zone, Volcanic Zone, Gauntlet Zone and Storm Zone.
 There are no saving or loading features. Instead, a password is presented each time a level is completed. In 2007 Incognito Entertainment remade the title as a multiplayer-only PlayStation 3 game.</desc>

		<desc>Warriors of Might and Magic is another entry in the Might and Magic line from 3DO. It is a single-player action-adventure title, in much the same vein of the previous entry in the series, Crusaders of Might and Magic. It is the first Might and Magic game to appear on the PlayStation 2.
			Players take on the role of Alleron, who has been plucked from his life by mysterious forces that seek only to bring him to his final fate. His face has been encased in a mysterious and shameful mask that he cannot remove. With it, he has set out on a quest to discover the truth behind his imprisonment, along the way becoming wrapped up in an adventure that will determine the fate of the very world.
			Alleron will quest through nine different worlds in hopes of finding his persecutors, the chief of which just might be the Grand Inquisitor, who has much knowledge of the mask Alleron bares. To make it through these worlds, Alleron has several different kinds of attacks at his disposal. He has traditional melee weapons, such as swords, axes, clubs, and maces to slice and dice the demonic hordes that stand in his way. He'll also borrow some power from the realms of magic, indulging in a spell system that will allow him to give himself power-ups and eradicate pesky monsters that block his path.
			Alleron can upgrade his armor and weapons, and he'll need it, with over 30 different varieties of monsters to face. But dark creatures aren't his only obstacle in this journey, as he'll also have to deal with deceptive and shady characters, solve puzzles, and hone his weapon and spell skills. It could be a long haul for Alleron, but the prospect of being trapped in the mask forever is much worse a fate.
			Features:
			- Lead Alleron through nine 3D worlds
			- Wield melee weapons and cast magic spells against more than 30 monster breeds
			- Upgrade and enhance a wide variety of weapons, armor, and magic</desc>

		<desc>Earth's defense satellites accidentally launch nuclear warheads due to computer malfunction.  Our planet is destroyed, except for a few factions that rebuild their strength and attempt to dominate the brave new world.  As you make your way across the wasteland, hunting down artifacts and destroying hostile forces, you find out that the satellite's unexpected nuclear launch may not have been entirely accidental after all...

You are in charge of searching the land for technological artifacts held by the other fellows.  These artifacts are then researched to create new weapons, chasses, and propulsion types, all of which are interchangable, meaning there are over 2000 units for you to blow stuff up with.  You can build tanks, hovercraft, Vertical Take Off/Landing (VTOL) vehicles, as well as cyborg units.  There are machine guns, missile launchers, flame throwers, mortars, etc.  Since all your technology comes from artifacts you swipe from your enemies, you are almost always fighting with weapons a step below what the other guy has, meaning you have to rely on your strategic prowess instead of sheer military superiority.  The battlefield is fully 3D, the camera is rotatable and zoomable, and all units are 3D as well, except for humans, which are sprites, but they aren't too plentiful, so it's a minor point.</desc>

		<desc>Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 is an ice hockey game for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation, it was released in 1997. The game is endorsed by hockey star, Wayne Gretzky and is the sequel to Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey.
 The game gained widespread criticism for several perceived shortcomings. The game was perceived to be crude and unfitting as a pure hockey simulator, leaving many enthusiasts disappointed, but many arcade fans delighted.
 Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey '98 continues same fast-paced, arcade-style spin that made its predecessor a system standout. The sequel retains the same look and feel as the original while adding new features to give players more choices in managing their teams.
 Both arcade and simulation play styles are available, with the latter expanding the roster size from 11 to 17 athletes; incorporating both injuries and fatigue; and recording team and league leader statistics throughout the season. Customization options include seven camera angles, toggles for penalties and fights, two game speeds, adjustable period lengths, and five difficulty levels.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Gameplay consists of two basic options: Arcade and Simulation. Although the graphics and earlobe vary little between the two, other changes have the effect of changing the chemistry and intensity of gameplay between the two options. The gamer has the ability to customize period length, fatigue (on/off), line changes, fighting (on/off), penalties (simulation only), rink size (arcade only), puck-streak (on/off), and camera angle.
 Simulation Mode:
 Simulation mode is designed to emulate the real game of hockey. Players may play five, four, or three to a side, depending on preference. Recognition of penalties, off-sides, and icing are all optional, but two-line pass is not considered. Period length can be selected between 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.
 Arcade Mode:
 During the Arcade mode checking, hooking, and tripping are more violent. Fights occur with greater frequency, and penalties are disregarded entirely. Additionally, arcade mode sees the introduction of a "power shot", which a player may utilize to light the net on fire after a goal. Arcade mode tends to be more exciting.</desc>

		<desc>World Championship Wrestling, Inc. (WCW) was an American professional wrestling promotion which existed from 1988 to 2001.
 WCW Backstage Assault is a professional wrestling video game by Electronic Arts. It was the final World Championship Wrestling (WCW) game released before the company was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF).
 WCW Backstage Assault takes over 50 WCW wrestlers out of the ring and into real-world venues like a locker room, garage and a loading dock. Traditional wrestling moves can be used, but weapons like two-by-fours and trash cans are also thrown into the mix. By working your way through the game's various modes, you can unlock additional wrestlers, areas and weapons. Bobby Heenan and Tony Schiavone provide the commentary with over 8,000 lines of dialogue.
 GAMEPLAY:
 Backstage Assault is vastly different from other games of its genre. Any wrestling game prior to it that featured backstage areas (such as the SmackDown! series or its predecessor, WCW Mayhem) treated them as auxiliary fighting locations. Backstage Assault took the concept further by removing the ring entirely and having all action take place backstage.
 Hardcore Challenge is Backstage Assault's primary gameplay mode. It consists of winning matches against random opponents until challenged by the champion.
 Throughout the game, players can unlock wrestlers, arenas, and moves for use in Create-a-Superstar. The player cannot defend the championship after earning it.
 Features:
 Choose from more than 50 WCW stars in an assortment of match types
 Fight in a total of 14 backstage areas, including a semi-trailer lot
 Use power-ups, weapons, and the environment to defeat your rivals</desc>

		<desc>WCW Mayhem is based on Ted Turner's hit cable wrestling league World Championship Wrestling. The game takes many of it's wrestlers and combines them with authentic moves, settings, and actual events found on the various cable programs and pay-per-view specials.
 "Mayhem" is probably an accurate word to describe the first wrestling game from Electronic Arts. A TV-style presentation features play-by-play commentary along with signature entrances enhanced by pyrotechnics and theme music. Over 50 professional wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling are included, although you'll need to play through the "Quest for the Best" mode to unlock them all.
 "Quest for the Best" has you advancing through three divisions in an attempt to win the TV title, the U.S. title, and the WCW Heavyweight Championship. You can compete on various levels of difficulty and unlock hidden wrestlers along the way, including broadcaster Mean Gene Okerlund and head of security Doug Dillinger. Other featured wrestlers include Goldberg, Sting, Diamond Dallas Page, Hollywood Hogan, and Macho Man Randy Savage.
 Additional options include a "Quick Start" game, a "Main Event" match, and the ability to design custom grapplers in the "Create Wrestler" mode. As the title suggests, WCW Mayhem is not limited to the confines of the ring. Thirteen backstage areas are available, including locker rooms, boiler rooms, first-aid rooms, and hallways. Various weapons are also included for use against your opponent, from tasers and baseball bats to standard chairs and trashcans.
 Individual matches can be customized to include the following types of play: Singles, or one-on-one fights; Handicap, where a single player takes on a two-wrestler tag team; Triangle, which pits three wrestlers against each other; Four Way Dance, where four wrestlers fight to be the last man standing; Battle Royal, which involves throwing as many wrestlers over the ropes as possible; and Tag Team, which is a two-on-two contest.
 Features:
 Features more than 50 WCW wrestlers with authentic moves and entrances
 Take the action outside the ring in 13 backstage areas
 Includes support for up to four players</desc>

		<desc>WCW vs. the World (known in Japan as Virtual Pro-Wrestling) is a professional wrestling video game released in 1997 for the PlayStation video game console. It was the first game developed by The Man Breeze (who later became the AKI Corporation) to be released outside of Japan and the second wrestling game for the PlayStation, following Power Move Pro Wrestling. WCW vs. the World marks the first title in the Japanese Virtual Pro-Wrestling series and would be the first World Championship Wrestling video game released during its rise amidst the Monday Night Wars.
 This is one of the original wrestling games for the Sony Playstation. It is the second title created, following Power Move Pro Wrestling. The game has a variety of characters from all over the world. There are 15 WCW Superstars (superstars at the time the game was created, anyway), and 60 wrestlers under aliases in the game. These wrestlers are from around the world, many in Japan, some even from the WWF. They are not under their real name because THQ did not have the copyright to them.
 The game itself consists of many modes. You control one wrestler at a time, and can take part in any of the following: League Challenge, fight for the belt in a league; Best of Seven, select seven opponents and fight for a new belt; Exhibition, pick any wrestlers and fight; Elimination, choose five wrestlers each, and winner stays on; Tournament, select up to eight wrestlers and battle; League, round-robin, winner is wrestler with most points; and Double Title, two wrestlers fight, winner wins both belts.
 The game features 51 wrestlers. In addition to its WCW/nWo roster, in keeping with the game's title, WCW vs. the World also has several "fictional" foreign wrestlers. These performers are actually renamed counterparts of real-life Japanese wrestlers that could not be properly represented in the game's American version due to copyright restrictions. This practice of altering Japanese performers for American games would carry on through two more AKI games for the Nintendo 64.</desc>

		<desc>The game is the sequel to WCW Nitro, WCW/NWO Thunder and features 60 professional wrestlers to play as or against, including Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Goldberg, and Diamond Dallas Page. Eleven play modes are available, from standard tournaments to deadly steel cage matches. The three main tournaments differ in the number of opponents you'll confront: five, seven, or ten different wrestlers from the WCW league.
 Other match types include exhibition, versus, tag team, battle royal, and cage match. While the majority of modes are single matches for practice or fun against the computer or a friend, battle royal is notable for its inclusion of 29 wrestlers. Whoever lasts the longest without being eliminated is declared the winner. Adjustable options include match lengths, group allegiances, ring-out times, difficulty, weapons, and controls.
 Fifteen different 3D rings are included, modeled after such authentic WCW events as the Spring Stampede and Starcade. Additionally, each wrestler's ring entrance, theme music, and signature-style rants have been captured in full-motion video for your viewing pleasure. Tony Schiavone and Mike Tenay offer up grapple-by-grapple, move-for-move commentary while you battle inside the ring.

Robinson contributes to the game through video clips and voiceovers, while the actual gameplay is rendered using polygon graphics.
 Players choose from 24 existing characters to represent themselves, ranging from a 17-year-old high school senior to a 66-year-old retired bank manager. The rules are the same as in the TV show with one exception: On the show, players provide answers off the top of their head, but here you given are four answers to choose from. Initially, only the first letter of each answer is given, but after ten seconds the full text of the answers are revealed. In Easy mode, the full text is always available, and in Junior mode, players choose from only two answers.
 The Single-Player and Multiplayer modes consist of a single show, while the Championship mode is a series of four shows with a top prize of $50 million. A password is provided at the end of each show allowing you to continue at a later time. Various aspects of the game can also be altered, ranging from the frequency of question categories to how much abuse characters receive from Robinson.

Wheel of Fortune features video clips and speech of host Vanna White (Pat Sajak is not included) as up to three players compete for cash and prizes. Games can be customized to last 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or between three to five rounds. A new twist comes in the form of the Solo Game, which allows you the chance to play without other contestants stealing your thunder.
 The catch is that you only have eight turns before the game ends. For every incorrect guess, bankrupt or lose-a-turn space you land on, you're forced to use one of your remaining free spins.
 Over 2,000 puzzles designed by the show's writers are included, but you don't have to worry about them repeating if you have a memory card; the game will keep track of your progress as well as the top five scores for each different mode you play.
 Wheel of Fortune also features high-resolution graphics, vibration feedback while spinning the wheel, and digitized pictures of the various prizes (such as hang gliders or paddle boats) if you're lucky enough to land on the space. Other options include choosing set locations, the amount of videos displayed (normal or minimal), the timer speed (normal, fast or slow) and volume levels of both sound and video.
 Features:
 Try your letter luck on over 2,000 puzzles written by the show's producers
 Featuring the voice and likeness of Vanna White
 Play alone in the solo version or challenge two friends to multiplayer action similar to the television show</desc>

		<desc>Based on the popular television game show, Wheel of Fortune 2nd Edition supplies puzzle solvers with 2,500 new puzzles. Hosted by Vanna White, there are four modes of gameplay and six options for setting a thematic stage, ranging from Disco to the Great Outdoors. Players can choose a normal or tournament game for three players, challenge the computer, or participate in a solo game.
 A self-adjusting AI system matches puzzles to the skill levels demonstrated by contestants, keeping the game competitive for players of all skill levels. Much like the television show, players spin the wheel for cash amounts and prizes. Bonus and bankrupt spaces appear on the wheel, and puzzle categories include People, Places, Things, Titles, Phrases, and Before and After.
 Options to spin the wheel, buy a vowel, or solve the puzzle are presented to each player during every round with the exception of the speed round. In this round the dollar value of each correctly guessed letter is predetermined by one final spin from Vanna. The player with the most cash at the end advances to the bonus round for a shot at winning a sailboat, ski trip, or other fantasy prize.
 Also included are behind-the-scene interviews and a sample contestant exam. This exam tests players puzzle-solving skills in a format similar to the official exam administered to potential contestants for the television show. To pass, players must solve 12 of 16 partially completed puzzles within five minutes. The answers are supplied in the instruction booklet. The behind-the-scenes option reveals video footage of interviews with Vanna White and different members of Wheel of Fortune's production staff.

		<desc>Trivia buffs and Regis Philbin fans unite -- you can now play the popular ABC game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire on your PlayStation console. Who Wants to be a Millionaire - 2nd Edition features 600 new questions and more smarmy commentary from the suave, aforementioned host.
 If you have been living under an Atari 2600 and are new to the Millionaire phenomena, you should know that players sitting in the hot seat must answer 15 multiple choice questions in order to win $1,000,000. If you want a chance at a cool million in the two-player mode of this game show simulation, you must first win a fastest finger contest in which you place items (such as films or states) in their proper order.
 Once you take the hot seat, Regis Philbin will give you a question with four possible answers. Answer it correctly (within the 30-second time limit) and you will win $100. Each ensuing question promises a bigger payoff. The questions start off relatively simple and get progressively more difficult as you work your way up the monetary ladder.
 From time to time, the host will ask: "Is that your final answer?" If you press no, you will be given 10 seconds to change your answer. Once you answer the $1,000 question, you are guaranteed at least that amount of money. If you manage to make it over the $32,000 hump, you will take home at least that much cash.
 If you get stuck on a question, you can use a lifeline. All three lifelines from the television show are included: Ask the Audience, in which you can poll the in-studio viewers; Phone a Friend, which lets you call a (computerized) pal for help; and 50/50, in which the computer takes away two of the wrong answers. You can use each lifeline only once. If you've used up all your lifelines, you don't know the answer and you don't want to risk going down to $1,000 or $32,000, you can simply quit the game and walk away with earnings received thus far.
 The game ends when you walk away, run out of time, miss a question or win a fantasy check for $1,000,000. A special Tonight's Leaderboard screen posts a list of the top 10 winners and their prize money.
 Features:
 Answer 600 all-new questions presented by Regis Philbin

		<desc>Wild 9 is a 2D platformer with 3D graphics, featuring gameplay similar in vein to the company's 2D Earthworm Jim games. Unique to Wild 9 is the 'rig', a weapon your character wields to carry enemies to torture and maim them to solve puzzles and progress through the game's ten levels. Basically, it's an interesting twist and homage to more old-school Super NES video gaming.</desc>

		<desc>Wild Arms is a classic style RPG with some wild west aspects such as guns (called ARMS) thrown in.  The main map view is done with graphics similar in style to those found on SNES RPGs but to a higher quality.  Combat is a typical turn based mode in 3D mode where you designate each characters actions at the start of each round.

During the game you control three characters: Rudy, a wanderer who uses ARMS, Jack, a treasure hunter, and Cecilia, an aprentice wizard.  During the game you encounter the usual hordes of monsters and discover a series of giant robot like cretures refered to as golems which play an important role in the plot.</desc>

		<desc>"Wild Arms 2" isn't really a sequel to Sony's original title. Your hero, a young soldier Ashley, is transformed to a demon. Ashley is determined to purge the evil from his body. He meets Brad, a criminal and a war-hero, and Lilka, a female magician. Together, they start a journey in order to discover the unknown foes which have corrupted Ashley, but soon they find out that a much greater conspiracy has taken place...

The combat system in "Wild Arms" is very similar to the one in Final Fantasy games: turned-based attacks, and a menu choice of physical attacks, spells, and even Guardians, which are more or less the same like the Guardian Forces in "Final Fantasy VIII". The "Arms" are special abilities which the party members learn while progressing in the game. 

"Wild Arms 2" also has many adventure elements, which links it to Nintendo's Zelda games. The dungeons (which can - and must - be viewed rotating the camera) contain many puzzles to solve.</desc>

		<desc>The Wild Thornberrys is an American animated television series that aired on Nickelodeon. It was rerun in the USA on Nickelodeon and occasionally The N until 2009 and Nicktoons until 2007. The show returned to the air on TeenNick's The '90s Are All That television block in November 2011.
 The series follows the Thornberrys, as they travel the world in their Communications Vehicle, referred to throughout the show as their "Commvee," looking for rare animals to film. Their second youngest child, Eliza, is the main character and has the power to speak to animals because of an encounter with an African shaman, Lopsugne Sjoungboun Qeisha. She can speak to the family's pet chimpanzee, who is also her best friend. She travels the world with her family and usually helps animals solve their problems.
 Players join Eliza and her globetrotting family of nature documentarians as they travel to exotic locations in search of rare and endangered animals in Wild Thornberrys: Animal Adventure. Nigel has decided to highlight severely endangered animals for his next documentary so The Thornberrys will need to explore animal habitats, avoid traps and solve puzzles as they make their way through the adventure.
 Players travel to seven destinations including Egypt, Vancouver, Kenya, Columbia, Belize, Iceland, and Tasmania. After choosing among any of the seven levels in the beginning of the game, you'll watch a short cartoon of The Thornberrys' describing the level's plot. Players can use Eliza's special ability to talk with animals to discover clues and receive special power-ups, while Darwin, Donny, Marianne and Debbie climb mountains, open secret passageways, swing on vines, and talk to the animals.
 Wild Thornberrys: Animal Adventure features artwork and voice acting from the same folks that work on the popular Nickelodeon cartoon series.
 Features:
 - Travel with the Wild Thronberrys through 14 adventures
 - Play as your favorite Thornberry including Eliza and Darwin
 - Explore dangerous environments while locating endangered species</desc>

Of the six games in this collection, Bubbles is by far the most obscure and was the least successful commercially in the arcades.</desc>

One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover Colonel Jeannette "Angel" Devereaux (Yolanda Jilot), due to her status among the Kilrathi as a respected warrior, who is executed by Prince Thrakhath using his claws to disembowel her (though her death scene is not shown until later in the game). The scene then cuts to the planet Vespus, where Blair and Brigadier General James "Paladin" Taggart inspect the downed wreckage of the TCS Concordia. The carrier is a total loss.</desc>

		<desc>Wipeout is a futuristic racing game set in the year 2052. Racing for one of four teams, the player competes in the F3600 Anti-Gravity Racing League on six tracks. Each team's hovercraft racer has different ratings in speed, acceleration and turning. In addition to high-speed racing, there is also shooting in the game, with different weapon pickups like rockets and mines available, useful for slowing one's opponents down. Shields can also be picked up and can block the weapons' effects.

There are championship, single race and time trial modes. Winning the championship in the regular Venom class unlocks the Rapier class, where the craft are faster and the tracks have slightly different looks.

There is also a two-player mode where two opponents can race and shoot at each other.</desc>

		<desc>World Cup 98 was the first official FIFA World Cup game developed by EA Sports after obtaining the rights from FIFA in 1997. Unlike the previous World Cup games, which were in 2D and showed a bird's-eye view, World Cup 98 was the first in the franchise to use a 3D engine, utilising DirectX for the PC version.
 Accurate national team kits (except for the goalkeepers who were issued a generic kit) were introduced complete with kit manufacturer logos and official merchandise. The game engine is based on that of FIFA: Road to World Cup 98, though it features some minor gameplay improvements to areas such as ingame strategy changing and player positioning.
 The playable teams in the friendly mode also included several nations that did not qualify for the finals. World Cup 98 was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Game Boy.</desc>

		<desc>World Destruction League - Thunder Tanks is a post-apocalyptic demolition derby, disguised as a sport dedicated to organizing exciting tank battles all over the planet. It's 2062 and the biggest TV show in history is about to broadcast nine of the best monster tank competitors, each with their own unique tank, battling for supremacy in Tournament mode or one of four Skirmish gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Frenzy, and Family. Multiplayer action allows two human players to go head-to-head with up to three additional computer-controlled players per team in split-screen mayhem.
 Features include continuations from a memory card or via input codes received at the end of each level, six control configurations, and three unmanned "drone" tanks to mix up the action. Vehicle enhancements run the gamut from guided missiles, shock rings, plasma bolts, shields, laser cannons, grenade launchers, teleporters, and mines to power-ups of health, nukes, ammunition, auto-fire, repairs, radar, and more. AI opponent strength can be set to easy, normal, or hard, and auto-cannons or drones can be turned off in Skirmish mode. Campaign mode consists of 12 rounds, and games are "broadcast" by two wacky commentators.
 Features:
 - Nine monster tank competitors, each with unique attributes, plus one final "boss"
 - Tournament, deathmatch, capture the flag, family, and frenzy game modes
 - Solo or two-player action
 - Twelve tank enhancements and nine power-ups</desc>

		<desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.</desc>

		<desc>Gameplay is turn-based, with each team moving in sequence (which is determined randomly) across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move one of its worms (unless the Select Worm item is used). Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives (such as collecting a specific crate).</desc>

		<desc>Worms World Party is an artillery game, which is a type of Turn-based strategy game. Like its predecessors, Worms World Party involves controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.</desc>

		<desc>In the tradition of Super Mario Kart and Motor Toon Grand Prix comes Wreckin' Crew, a cartoon-like racer that emphasizes the use of various power-ups to keep your opponents from finishing before you. Up to two players can choose one of three modes: Arcade Race, which is a single race on your choice of tracks; Time Trial, where you can work on your speed; and Competition, which involves embarking on a series of four races in an attempt to win one of the championship cups.
 While only the Training Cup is initially available, you can participate in more challenging races after placing first on normal difficulty or higher. You'll also earn a video clip for each of the eight characters you use to win the Competition (plus two hidden), which can be saved and viewed at a later time in the Film Room. The four courses include Sydney, New York, Mediterranean and Theme Park. In addition, a bonus Stunt Track will give you a chance to collect as many power-ups as you can by driving over ramps before time runs out.
 Each course will have several items you can run over, including stars to increase the number of times you can fire your car's default weapons, nitros to give you a boost of speed, and repair kits to fix any damage suffered by your vehicle. In total, there are twelve different course objects that can help or hinder you while racing. Other options include racing the courses backwards, toggling day or night, and setting the number of laps from three to fifteen. While your best lap and race times will be saved to memory card, progress can also be continued via passwords.</desc>

		<desc>THQ managed to wrest the WWF license away from Acclaim for no less than ten years (as of 2000). THQ then went to the respected Japanese wrestling game developer Yuke's Co., Ltd, who produces the Toukon Retsuden series, and told them to make a game worthy of The Rock. WWF SmackDown! was the result of this collaboration.
 Based on the prime time UPN WWF television show that made its debut in September of 1999, WWF SmackDown! tries to capture all elements of the typical WWF broadcast. While all the usual mayhem involved within the ring is present, including a Season mode, I Quit matches, Falls Count Anywhere and the like, the game takes a more global approach to the WWF as it also offers a story mode. Now you'll be able to directly experience the backstage drama that is an integral part of a WWF broadcast. You'll develop rivalries, make allies and try to defend your best interests.
 You'll be get the chance to play as over 30 of the top WWF superstars from the year 2000. Your superstar of choice will be able to make a bold entrance thanks to the authentic Titantron footage that plays before the wrestler makes their entrance. The attitude will be thick in the arena after a win thanks to the authentic post-match victory poses and exit themes. You'll also get to create your own wrestlers with the Create a Wrestler Mode, and unlock hidden personalities and wrestlers during extended Season mode play.
 Players will also get a variety of arenas and backstage areas to face off in as they enter the Smackdown Hotel. You'll be able to feel the electricity as you throw your opponent up the ramp and drag his pathetic carcass off to the kitchen, the parking lot, or even the boiler room.
 So know your role and get ready to bow down to the masters. The people's game has arrived, so get ready to "layeth the smacketh down" on the entire WWF roster present in the game. To be in the game, you have to beat the game.
 Features:
 - Play through the story and make decisions that alter the story, tag teams and rivalries
 - Taunt your opponent with signature moves and mannerisms of WWF wrestlers
 - Create your own master of the ring by adjusting moves and personality variables with sliding scales</desc>

		<desc>WWF Smackdown! 2 Know Your Role follows 2000's highly successful WWF Smackdown! with wrestlers new to the federation (over 50 included) and never before seen Ladder and Tornado Tag Team matches. Whereas the original title was the first wrestling game to have storyline sequences, this sequel has improved on the idea with better and up to date character interaction.
 The subtitle of WWF Smackdown! 2 comes from one of the World Wrestling Federation's most notable superstars -- The Rock; he informs his opponents to "Know your role and shut your mouth!"
 The sequel features a larger arsenal of moves, which not only includes signature moves of WWF wrestlers, but also those of other wrestling promotions, such as WCW, Japanese associations, etc. The game also adds striking moves in one-on-one matches and special double team moves.
 The Season Mode from the previous game returns, adding more scenes depicting wrestlers preparing for a match, and featuring multiplayer support, with up to four players participating in a tournament. Create-A-Superstar mode has been enhanced, allowing the player to customize facial features and outfits of their wrestlers. A new Create-A-Taunt feature, in which the player can create a new taunt for a custom wrestler, has been added.
 Features:
 - Featuring a variety of WWF experiences including the "High Flying Ladder" match, "Hell in a Cell," and the "Casket" matc
 - Select from 50 different characters and fight in a variety of environments including the VIP room and a parking lot
 - Cooperate with a friend and finish your opponent in "Tornado Tag Team" mode</desc>

		<desc>WWF War Zone is a wrestling game based on the show of the same name. It includes a wide variety of World Wrestling Federation superstars (mostly current through the year 1998) as well as gameplay modes. Among the wrestlers included are Shawn Michaels, Triple H and Stone Cold as well as The Undertaker and his brother Kane. Each superstar has his own unique "finishing move" programmed in as well as their regular maneuvers.
 The various gameplay options are as follows: WWF Challenge, Versus, Steel Cage, Hardcore, War, and Tag Team. If you choose to play through the Challenge, you are presented with a full wrestling "season" in competition for the belt. The various versus modes allow you to play with up to 4 friends in a tag team match, or a straight-up rumble called the Tornado. While it is essentially a Battle Royal, the War mode is an every man for himself match to the finish. The last man standing wins.
 In addition to the featured superstars and some hidden characters, WWF War Zone gives you the option of creating your own wrestler. You can select your own unique facial expressions, hair, weight, height, body art and wrestling moves (there are over 300 motion-captured moves in the game). It allows you to save up to thirty wrestlers on a memory card.
 To bring authenticity to the game, Vince McMahon and Jim Ross conduct a play by play commentary of each wrestling match. WWF War Zone is also compatible with the Multi Tap.
 Features:
 - Six ways to play, including Versus, Tag Team, Steel Cage, and War
 - Triple H, Stone Cold, The Undertaker, Kane -- play as your favorite WWF star or create your own
 - Authentic play-by-play commentary from Vince McMahon and Jim Ross</desc>

		<desc>WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game merges the personalities and action of the popular WWF TV show characters with a Mortal Kombat-style fighting game. This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger.
 Although presented as a wrestling title, this game is structured like a one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF. Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer.
 Step into the ring with eight of the biggest stars in the WWF including Brett The Hitman Hart and the Undertaker. Wear down the opposition with standard wrestling moves, and then climb the ropes for some high-flying action. If you are taking a beating, you can quickly turn things around by using one of the character-specific special moves. Try to stake your claim on the championship belt in WWF WRESTLEMANIA: The Arcade Game.
 FEATURES:
 - Eight WWF stars
 - Wear down the opposition with standard wrestling moves

		<desc>After an outbreak of UFO sightings and alien abductions, panic spread like wildfire across the globe. What exactly was happening? Have aliens come to take over Earth? Realizing the need to address the situation, delegates from the world's superpowers gathered in Geneva to decide on a plan of action.
			An agreement was reached to form a secret group to investigate this potential alien threat, and if necessary, use deadly force to stop them. This covert organization would be called the Extraterrestrial Combat unit (X-COM for short), composed of the most talented pilots, troops, scientists and engineers the world had to offer.
			X-COM: UFO Defense is based on the 1994 PC game originally developed by Mythos Games Ltd. The player assumes control of the X-COM task force, building bases and tracking various UFOs on a 3D map of Earth. Once a UFO is spotted (represented by a red cross), you must try to intercept it so that it crashes over dry land. You'll then need to send your heavily armed squad to the site, where you'll witness the downed craft and surrounding terrain from an isometric perspective.
			Moving your troops is accomplished through a point-and-click interface with each side alternating turns. Your three goals are to (1) engage the aliens face to face, (2) either stun or kill them, and (3) retrieve whatever technology or weapons you find so your scientists can replicate them. After all, you have to fight fire with fire! The PlayStation version supports both the mouse and memory card, with the latter allowing you to save the game at any point (as long as you have five blocks free).</desc>

She will finally get her revenge upon the gods who imprisoned her and the world they created. Only one thing is stopping her. In order for her spell to gain ultimate power to work she must sacrifice a queen.
			Unfortunately for Xena, it would appear that Gabrielle is the sacrifice de jour, being Queen of the Amazons and all. So with the help of her allies, who just happen to be Xena's bitter enemies, she has captured Gabrielle and it's up to Xena, Warrior Princess to save her.
			It won't be easy though. Nothing for Xena ever is. She will have to journey far and wide before she can face Kalabrax. She must defeat the vile King Valarian and his cronies as well as Narsus the evil renegade Amazon, and a host of other creatures like a cyclops and dragon just to name a few.
			Developed by Universal Studios Digital Arts, Xena: Warrior Princess is one experience you won't forget as you must defeat all the enemies on a stage, solve puzzles and save a few hapless villagers before you can continue on your journey. You have all of Xena's trademark moves and weapons at your disposal, including her classic warrior scream.
			Will it be enough to save Gabrielle from becoming an ingredient in Kalabrax's evil spell? Can you save the world? Do you really want to save the gods? There's really no choice; you must stop Kalabrax before all you hold dear crumbles in an instant.
			Safe journey! Battle on, Xena...</desc>

		<desc>In Xevious 3-D/G+, you pilot a sleek Solvalou space fighter blasting and bombing your way through an overwhelming alien invasion force consisting of airborne attackers, ground defenses, and enormous "boss" motherships.
			Based on the premise that aliens who originally settled Earth have returned (and they're not happy about the proliferation of the human race, go figure), Xevious 3-D/G+ is a 3-D remake of the original Namco classic Xevious (licensed to Atari in the early 1980s).
			The new game sticks to the basic concepts of the original Xevious, right down to the familiar overhead view. Power-ups offer new weapons such as constant-fire, electrocution beams and wide-dispersal lasers --- but along with new weapons come new enemies and new bosses who aren't quite so easy to eliminate.
			Included as a bonus are the original Xevious, emulated to perfection (a nice addition since the only other PlayStation version available is on the rather hard-to-find Namco Museum Volume 2), and the only console version available of Xevious Arrangement, a more obscure coin-up conversion designed to vex those who had plowed their way through the original.</desc>

		<desc>The term street football encompasses a number of informal varieties of association football. These informal games do not necessarily utilise the requirements of a formal game of football, such as a large field, field markings, goal apparatus and corner flags, eleven players per team (with a minimum of seven per team), or match officials (referee and assistant referees).
 Often the most basic of set-ups will involve just a ball with a wall or fence used as a goal, or items such as clothing being used for goalposts (hence the phrase "jumpers for goalposts"). The ease of playing these informal games explains why they are popular all over the world.
 XS Jr. League Soccer is designed to provide a fun, pick-up-and-play adaptation of the world's most popular sport, with colorful graphics and accessible gameplay for the whole family to enjoy.
 Select Your Team: 20 individual players. Everybody can really play. Players have different skill levels. 8000 different 5-a-side combos. Schoolyard Tournaments: Put a strong team together; play an entire round robin tournament in one day. 4 Real World Fields: The School Yard, Sandpit, Car Park, Southside.</desc>

		<desc>American football is a sport played between two teams of eleven with the objective of scoring points by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone. Known in the United States simply as football, it may also be referred to informally as gridiron football, and even more rare, the "pigskin".[3] The ball can be advanced by running with it or throwing it to a teammate. Points can be scored by carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass thrown over that goal line, kicking the ball through the opponent's goal posts or tackling an opposing ball carrier in his own end zone.

		<desc>International motorcycle racing glides onto the PlayStation with 22 circuits from around the globe and four gameplay modes: Single Race, Championship, 2-Player Race, and 2-Player Championship. Competing in Championship mode will unlock ten of the 22 tracks, depending on the difficulty selected (novice, amateur, or professional), but additional Skill Tests must be completed successfully to allow access to the extra tracks and gameplay at higher difficulty levels. The criteria for the difficulty settings include steering and braking assistance as well as the amount of damage sustained.
			Options include selection of race length (three, five or ten laps, or a full race of 100km), motorbike setups (gearbox, 21 sprocket sets for gear ratio, and tires), background music, and a vibration function. Championship mode consists of four stages (Beginner Trophy, Novice Challenge, Expert Cup, and Elite GP) which must be completed at the novice difficulty setting before access to more tracks and game modes is available. Multiplayer action is provided for two players via horizontal split screen.</desc>

If the shape is of a different color, or it is hit when collecting a line of similar shapes, your piece exchanges colors with the shape.</desc>

These fearless animated characters have ignored potential danger and taken to their own environment, even venturing to a hazardous street and the perilous Pizza Planet in a heated competition to find out which toy is the best driver.
 Released for the PlayStation, Disney/Pixar's Toy Story Racer is a go-kart racing title that endeavors to bring the action and environments from the animated classic to said console. Natural for the genre, the various vehicles, characters and power-ups are not realistic nor attempt to be; instead, these things are arcade-like in nature and used in the tradition of Mario Kart. Armchair kart fans will race through 18 courses and have access to various modes. Completion of these modes will unlock a plethora of secrets.</desc>
