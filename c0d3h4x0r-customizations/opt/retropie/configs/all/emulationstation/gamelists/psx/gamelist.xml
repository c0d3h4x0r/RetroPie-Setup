    <desc>Fishing is usually a relaxing sport, even in videogame form. Action Bass attempts to introduce people to the world of fishing, and comes in four play modes. In Challenge mode, you only get three minutes to catch a fish large enough to meet the weight requirement and place you within the top three fishermen. When you pass the first level, you'll have three other levels to defeat. Beating all four levels unlocks new lures and grants access to the Extra option.

The second play mode in Action Bass is the Free mode, where you can freely fish in any of the four available areas and hone your fishing skills. Here you can discover the best spots to catch the bigger fish in less time in preparation for the Challenge mode. You also have the option of saving your fish for the Aquarium, the third mode in Action Bass, where the fish you caught in the Free mode can be viewed by moving in all directions around the fish.</desc>

You'll need to chase down the enemy vehicles with your own trusty assortment of cars, motorbikes, and the like, blasting them until they slow down for good. After this, it's on to the third-person action levels, where you control Action Man from behind the back as he makes his way through enemy territory, and must occasionally solve puzzles to get out of whatever predicament he's found himself in this time.

The game's levels feature a myriad of locales, from evil villains' bases to the burning sands of the desert to the arctic chill of the North Pole. You'll face many of Action Man's most notorious fiends during the adventure. You have a host of weapons, from your trusty hand-gun to automatic weapons and even a sniping rifle.</desc>

    <desc>Adidas Power Soccer kicks its way onto the PlayStation. You are given a wide variety of gameplay options to choose from, such as season and tournament modes, single games, and multiplayer.

When going through the season mode, you can play either a shortened season or an official full-length season. Your team, as well as your opponents, are taken from all over Europe and other countries. If you're interested in reaching supreme glory at a quicker pace, there is an option for cup battle. Like it implies, you'll have to beat a certain number of teams in tournament fashion to claim your prize.

The game can be played two different ways, arcade or simulation. By choosing the arcade mode, you won't have to worry about soccer physics or penalties whereas the simulation goes by actual soccer rules. If you lay into someone's shin, you'll probably get called for a penalty. Depending on the severity of the penalty, the game will switch to a penalty shot mode, just like real soccer.</desc>

    <desc>Agile Warrior F-111X is a flight combat game that puts you in the heat of battle against terrorists. It seems some sort of agency is threatening the general welfare of the country, and it is up to you to thwart its diabolical plans.

In order to stop the enemy, you'll take to the skies in your trusty aircraft (a combination of the YF-23, X-31, and the F-111). Like Air Combat, there are various missions to conquer (over six in all). There are stealth missions requiring you to avoid radar, bombing, and missile raids, and straight-up dogfights. Resistance comes in the form of other aircraft, sea cruisers, ground turrets, and missiles.

Your plane has the ability to detect enemies on radar, fire various missile weapons, and cloak itself from radar (very handy for those stealth missions). In order to survive, each feature must be utilized and learned by the player. Certain objectives require the use of heat-seeking missiles and strategy. If you go in with guns and missiles blazing, in all likelihood, you'll get shot out of the sky.</desc>

The aim is to have a higher score than your opponent when the timer hits zero, and to make that a little easier there are bonuses strewn across the table. Some are activated upon touch, while others are stored with the player until used.

The only two gameplay options are 1 player versus the computer or 2 players versus each other.

    <name>Alien Resurrection</name>
    <desc>Two hundred years after the events of Alien&amp;#xB3;, Lieutenant Ellen Ripley is cloned by military scientists interested in the Alien Queen she had become a host for. Like the "Company" from the earlier films, the military intends to use the Queen to breed a force of bio-weapons. But then something goes wrong; the Aliens they are studying manage to escape, and swarm throughout the science ship. It's up to four stranded heroes - Ripley, Call, DiStephano and Christie - to wipe out the Aliens, and return the ship safely to Earth.

Gameplay is standard FPS action, with limited ammo and plenty of hazards to detour around or find the switch to deactivate. The player switches between the four main characters at each level change, each with a slightly different set of abilities (Call has a motion tracker, Christie has his twin pistols from the film). Levels are based around keeping the Auriga running, and making their way through the ship to escape.</desc>

    <desc>All Star Racing combines four distinct racing modes: GT Racer, Stockcar Frenzy, Classic Cars, and Supercar Challenge. Pre-race options include difficulty setting (easy, medium or hard), number of laps (3-lap sprints to 15-lap endurance races), Dualshock vibration, and sound volume adjustments. This budget title from Mud Duck Productions offers single races against five computer-controlled opponents and a choice of three cars per racing style. No multiplayer or career modes are available.

Each race style includes three courses and three types of vehicles. The classic cars (Stalwort, Belling V2, and SK MK2) race on or through mountains, hillsides, and forests. GT cars (GSX, GT2R and CRX2) run at Iona, Boulder, and Hampton speedways, while Champ Team, File Team, and SPD Team stockcars race on runway, countryside, and urban tracks. The super cars (Pina 238, Fenzo 500, and Manelli 748) compete on hills, ridges, and a forest-valley track.

All Star Racing includes GT, stockcar, super cars, and classics racing on a limited number of fictional tracks. Though released in 2002, All Star Racing's graphics and gameplay are reminiscent of early to mid-90s racing titles.</desc>

    <desc>The first dodge ball game released on the PlayStation, All-Star Slammin' D-Ball features a horizontal view of the court as eight teams compete in one of two modes: Single Match and Tournament. Teams are individually rated from one to five in throwing, catching, dashing, and dodging abilities. Offbeat male and female characters of varying skill play for the Wild Cats, Pranksters, Heart Breakers, Ninjas, Snipers, Fireballs, Thunder Bolts, and Elementals.

The game follows the general rules of dodge ball, in that the object is to knock out the opposing members of a team within a time limit. Players with the ball can aim right, left, high, or low. Thrown balls can be caught by the opposing team, which awards them points. These points can then be used to implement special throws such as the grenade, boomerang, and the screwdriver, making the balls more difficult to avoid or catch. Options include adjustable time limits for Single Matches and three levels of difficulty.</desc>

    <desc>Allied General is the sequel to Panzer General and uses the same turn-based gameplay mechanics. This time the player experiences World War II from the Allied point of view during two British, one U.S. and one Russian campaign. The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.

The most important thing to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for a little amount of turns) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.</desc>

    <desc>With American Pool, publisher Mud Duck brings a budget-priced virtual 3D billiards presentation with three modes of gameplay to the PlayStation. In Training mode, players learn the controls and various pool techniques by solving tasks and problems, while Pocket Game mode offers five types of pool including 9-Ball, 8-Ball, Basic, Rotation and 14-1 Rack. The final mode, Pool Contest, is a 9-Ball bracketed tournament in which players create their own character and level up with special shots and techniques as they advance through the pairings.

Examples of special skills that can be earned include Low Tech (adds a visual line from the cue ball to facilitate aiming), Easy Shot (drops the speed of the power gauge by one-third), and Free Ball (allows the cue ball to be placed in any location). As players reach higher levels of skill, additional abilities are unlocked. Specific conventions used in American Pool include "Texas Express Rules" in 9-Ball games, the requirement to "call your shot" in 8-Ball, and the loser of banking in 14-1 Rack taking the break shot.</desc>

Take a customized stock car out on one of the 16 real-world tracks like Calder Park Thunderdome, Oceanside International Raceway, or Vallejo Speedway. Should slamming the walls of the track become a regular occurrence, the car will start to show the wear and tear of the race: spoilers will break off, headlights will shatter, or wheels will go flying with really big crashes. To keep that from happening, join the racing school and get video tips from the Andretti family. After learning how to keep your car in mint condition, challenge a friend with the Two-Player mode or compete in the Season mode and claim the championship.

Ape Escape is the story of a band of rogue monkeys that escape from the amusement park and mistakenly break into a genius professor's laboratory. They find the inventions called the Peak Point Helmets and instantly become intelligent, with a particularly ingenious simian named Specter running the others. In a theme reminiscent of Planet of the Apes, these little creeps plan on changing history so that apes rule the world and humankind becomes the special attraction at amusement parks.

    <desc>A Raven operating out of Isaac City receives an unusual request. Not only is the request both vague and cryptic, stating simply: "Infiltrate the underground urban complex, Amber Crown,", but it also bypasses normal channels of communication and is sent directly to the Raven in question, without anyone else seeing the message. No sender name or corporate affiliation is mentioned, but the monetary reward promised is massive. Because of the amount, the mission will obviously be intensely dangerous, but Ravens aren't the type to shy away from any challenge. With interest piqued, the Raven climbs into the AC and heads toward Amber Crown.</desc>

    <desc>Unlike previous releases under 3DO's prolific Army Men brand, Green Rogue is a character-based game featuring action and adventure from a third-person perspective. Players take on the role of the Omega Soldier, a powerful one-man army biotechnologically enhanced with genetic coding taken from members of the Green Army's Bravo Company and from the series' uber-hero Sarge himself. The game features multiple levels of escapade as the Omega Soldier attempts dangerous missions and battles against enormously powerful enemy toys.

A new breed of plastic soldier is genetically engineered from the best soldiers in the green army. During a mission to transport this new form of troop to a testing facility the transport chopper is shot down. Waylaid in the heart of Tan headquarters, the Green Rouge wakes. He must then fight his way out of the enemy base, tearing apart tan soldiers wherever he sees them. This will be the final test for these genetically engineered Green Rouges. Will the pass the test or will they fall into the hands of the tan forces?</desc>

    <desc>Army Men: Sarge's Heroes lets you play the role of Sergeant Hawk as he takes on the Tan Army in a series of 16 missions with over 40 different objectives, which range from simple seek-and-destroy to involved reconnaissance operations. The game is played from a third-person perspective so to familiarize yourself with the controls, you can enroll in Boot Camp to run through an obstacle course, practice firing weapons, and work on combat skills.

To begin the single-player campaign, you'll receive objectives from General Grimm after which your character will appear in a combat zone. Use the map in the corner of the screen to help find your way to the current objective, carefully noting the type of terrain so you can plan your route of attack. But members of the Tan Army will try to thwart your progress every step of the way, so keep an eye on your health meter to know when to stop fighting and search for a Medkit. Also available on levels are Ammo Boxes (to replenish your standard-issue M-16), bazookas, flamethrowers, and sniper rifles. Since you can't replenish the ammo for the extra weapons, you'll have to take your shots carefully. The environments you'll battle in include real-world outdoor settings and indoor "alternate world" locales that include a giant bathroom, garden, sandbox, kitchen, and living room. Besides firing at everything that moves, Sarge can crawl on his belly, kneel, roll on the ground and climb ladders. Every hit makes Sarge move a bit slower so it's important to avoid gunfire at all costs!</desc>

    <desc>This collection honors the 30th anniversary of Atari, one of the first great companies in the videogame industry by reissuing versions of 12 arcade classics for play on PlayStation systems. Included are Asteroids and Asteroids Deluxe, Battlezone, Black Widow, Centipede, Gravitar, Missile Command, Pong, Space Duel, Super Breakout, Tempest and Warlords. The bundle also includes a souvenir sticker, a video interview with Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, press releases from the original games and images of game memorabilia. Atari Anniversary Edition Redux is mouse and analog control compatible and is multi-tap adaptable for up to four players.

In addition to the pure emulation modes, there is an option to display the cabinet art surrounding the display of each game, intended to give the player a sense of actually playing a stand-up machine.

Each game also has a toggle for an "enhanced" graphical mode, which varies from game to game. For instance, "enhanced" asteroids merely has a static backdrop, whereas "enhanced" warlords is a complete graphical overhaul with new colors. It should be noted that the "enhanced" version of Tempest is none other than Tempest Tubes, a modification for Tempest made in 1982 by Duncan Brown.</desc>

    <desc>ATV Mania is an all-terrain vehicle combat racing game. Modes include Championship, Single Race, and Time Attack.

The main mode is the Championship mode which lets the player compete in an underground ATV championship circuit which is being held amongst the French Alps. The player's goal is to win the races by any means necessary.

The player gets to choose to play as one of six different racers, with each racer having their own ATV to race with. Each vehicle has its own unique ratings in speed, grip, and armor. The player then races against 5 of the other racers on 6 different tracks. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points and cash they earn. The player with the most points after all 6 races are done wins the championship. Also, after each race, the racer is asked questions by another character, where they get to choose their answer from a list of responses. For example, an investigative news reporter trying to get a scoop on the illegal races, gives the player an interview, which can earn the player some extra cash depending on how cooperative they are. Any cash earned can then be spent on more weapon ammo for the player's vehicle. Examples of weapons included in the game are grenades, land mines and homing missiles.</desc>

In tournament mode, players get to choose one of the 10 (8 are selectable from the start and 2 are unlockable) animal racers to race with. The tournament offers three different sets of trophy races; the cross cup, dune cup, and the rock cup. Each cup consists of 3 different racetracks; underground, red rock, and atlantis. These 3 racetracks get altered depending on what cup the player is competing for.

When racing, players attempt to beat the five opponents they are up against to the finish line. To help achieve this goal, players can shoot guided rockets, use speed boosts, and lay mines to hinder their opponents. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points they earn. The player with the most points after all the races are done wins the championship cup.</desc>

However Ballistic places the player in the center of the screen shooting the balls outward. In Panic! mode, a constant string of balls appear and the player must keep destroying similar balls to keep the string short and prevent it from snaking around and reaching the middle of the screen. In Checkmate mode, a limited amount of balls are given to the player which they must use to destroy all the balls on the screen. Strategy is used here since the amount of balls destroyed must be maximized.</desc>

    <desc>Designed for the armchair angler in mind, Bass Landing captures the essence of being on an actual lake and boat without the hassle of reaching into your tackle box and pulling back a handful of slime! There are five different lakes in all, ranging from the murky Lunker Lake to the mountainous clarity of Crystal Lake. Each contains natural and manmade hazards (branches, poles, rocks) and different kind of fish--depending on the kind of fish you want, choose your lake accordingly.

For instance, the Silver Carp can only be found in dark, murky lakes or swamps and the Spotted Bass resides in the chilly, colder water areas. While the name of the game is bass, there are 14 different types of fish including the small but feisty Blue Gill, massively dynamic Carp, and the multiplying Rainbow Trout.

In addition to his or her game, the armchair fisherman will need to know how his fishing rod works and what lures to use on the various fish. There are fifty different tools in all ranging from Spinner Bait to the MHB-665 Bait Rod--one will want to know the functions of each lure and rig and choose an appropriate rod for the type of fish being hunted.</desc>

    <desc>Battlestations is a title where you take control of your own fleet, ranging from patrol boats and mine layers to battleships and aircraft carriers. You'll get to pick any of the ten missions right away, all of which have a different challenge to encounter, like protecting your base from troop transports, and a mission where you'll have to prevent poachers from killing whales. You'll also get to pick from five commanders to fight against, all of which have stereotypical strengths and weaknesses. Afterwards, you'll go right to the mission, where you'll be able to navigate your ship silhouettes on a 2D, radar-esque map.</desc>

    <desc>This game was believed to be the sport of the future by many developers. You control a tank and try to score more goals than your opponent in a set amount of time. But this is no ordinary sports game; you get weapons and can shoot your opponent to prevent them from scoring. Perhaps we'll never see this sport in real life but at least we've got it in videogame form.</desc>

    <name>BattleTanx: Global Assault</name>
    <desc>BattleTanx: Global Assault makes its PlayStation debut with more levels than the earlier Nintendo 64 version. Split-screen multiplayer support is also included, but for two players instead of four. The fast-paced action involves motoring across grid-like environments in one of 13 well-outfitted tanks. Solo players can complete 40 search-and-destroy missions in the campaign mode, while up to two friends can blast each other to scrap metal in seven deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and tag variants. Twenty power-ups are available in total, ranging from cloaking and teleporting devices to plasma bolts and guided missiles. Featured levels take place in futuristic versions of San Francisco, Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin, all of which are home to ruthless, tank-driving gangs.

Prior to the game's beginning, Griffin Spade set about reclaiming his lost love and establishing his tribe in San Francisco. But the peace he'd blasted out for himself looks to be short-lived as he's having frequent nightmares about a sinister QueenLord. It's up to Griffin to mount up again and with all the finesse that a giant tank can muster and solve the mystery behind this evil woman. And so the stage is set for Battle Tanx: Global Assault.</desc>

    <desc>In BEAST WARS you travel along the planet's surface and explore many areas, looking to destroy any enemies that cross your path. The innovative auto-targeting system locks on to any enemies in your area and makes for some straightforward killing. However, don't think it's going to be easy, as you will have to dodge enemy gunfire at the same time. Eventually, your character will use up his Energon supply and you will have to refuel by transforming into Beast mode. While in Beast mode you cannot attack, and your sole purpose is to find power-ups to restore your Energon. BEAST WARS offers 10 different transformers to choose from, each with their own traits. You'll also have the chance to battle in four different environments, each having its own set of enemies. With 24 missions to play and eight bonus missions, you'll have plenty to keep you occupied. Transformers fans will love this game.</desc>

    <name>BeyBlade: Let It Rip!</name>
    <desc>Similar to games featuring robots, monsters, or fighters battling for supremacy, Beyblade pits spinning tops, known as bei-goma, against one another in Tournament and Free Battle modes. In the former, players earn ten Bey Points (used to buy parts) and five Experience Points (used to level up) for each victory, but only five and three points respectively for a loss. Tournaments consist of seven rounds, including a semi-final and final round, with the ultimate winner being named champion and earning one of 30 Beyblade parts, while the vanquished receive 20 Bey Points as a consolation prize.

In Free Battle mode, players choose to battle with one of eight Beybladers from the television series. Two players can compete against each other, assuming one has data saved on a PS memory card. Three complete Beyblades can be saved at any given time, with customization of names, gender, and parts (exchange or buy). Beyblades consist of five main parts and a launcher, including a bit chip, attack ring, weight disk, spin gear, and blade base, and players can carry up to nine spare parts for repair or customization.

Battles require four points to win and features include special launches, shifting paths (based on the spinning top's parameters), special attacks, gimmicks (special powers inherent in some parts), and growth (to a maximum level of 19). Rewards are given for moving up levels, such as increases to endurance, mobility, attack power, and so forth. Throughout the battles, DJ Jazzman provides play-by-play in the Beystadium, Kenny offers help in customization, and Mr. Tate manages the parts shop.</desc>

Naturally, dropping the line is not going to be enough; you'll have to choose lures wisely and use the proper technique if you want to catch anything.

The game was developed by Hammerhead and published by Activision for the Game Boy Color and PlayStation in 2000. It follows the adventure of Blade with help of his mentor and friend Abraham Whistler, and with old remembered enemies like Dragonetti and Mannheim.

The player takes control of the title character as he makes his way through various vampire-infested locations in order to defeat the vampire menace. Blade ventures through warehouses, sewers, museums, city streets, and nightclubs dispatching numerous types of enemies ranging from familiars (humans that do a vampire's bidding), vampires, zombies, monsters, killer dogs, and other creatures of the night. To help Blade with his quest, he has a small arsenal of weapons to arm himself with courtesy of Whistler. Blade always has his trademark sword, but can also use his fists as well as a variety of firearms including pistols, shotguns, and machine pistols. Each firearms has three different types of ammunition: standard, explosive, and silver, each with its own effect on different enemies. Blade is also equipped with a "multi-launcher" that can shoot all sorts of things to kill vampires, like silver glaives and UV grenades.</desc>

The objective of each level is to obtain the crystal within the allotted time and before your competition to progress to the next chamber and avoid a rather gruesome death.

There are three different gameplay options. The Solo Survivor is a single player romp featuring forty unique chambers in a race against the clock to maneuver up and down steps, throw switches that alter the playing field, and avoid hazards. Your only enemy is the dwindling time on the clock; if you fail to obtain the crystal when the clock strikes zero, its lights out for you! Supporting four human players via a Multi-Tap adapter, the Eliminator mode is a one shot deal. Incorporating a tournament ladder, you're presented with one opportunity to obtain the crystal; if you fail, you're out of the game ... permanently. The Free-For-All mode is a little more forgiving. The objective of this mode is to die as little as possible within the given time period. In the event you die, you're immediately resurrected. Whichever player has died the least at the end of the game wins.</desc>

    <desc>BLOODY ROAR pits eight fighters with unique "Spirit Animals" against each other. Don't just beat your opponents; pummel them into the ground by using combo after combo, or transforming into the character's "Spirit Animal," which might be a killer rabbit, gorilla, fox, or something else, entirely. See the moment of victory with instant replays that show the blow that put the loser down for good. Every fighter is involved in the tournament for his or her own reasons, and you can play as each of the characters to learn those reasons. With all of the action in BLOODY ROAR, the beast in you just might come out.</desc>

    <desc>Transform and do battle as a human-animal hybrid in this classic 3D fighting game! Put your strength to the test and fight your way to the top!

The hook of the Bloody Roar series is that your combatants can transform into animalistic versions of themselves -- human-animal hybrids with a thirst for violence. During each round you can fight as a person or transform into a beast when your meter fills up. As an animal you'll have more moves at your disposal with which to destroy your opponent.</desc>

    <desc>Konami's Bottom of the 9th is the first baseball game on the PlayStation to use polygonal players. Batting and pitching relies on aiming cursors, which can be "locked-on" to make things easier for novices. The game has an MLBPA license for real players from the 1995 season, but no Major League Baseball affiliation, so teams are listed by city name only.

Eight fictional stadiums are also available, and a complete season along with statistical tracking can be saved to memory card. Don't want to play a complete season? No problem, the schedule can be shortened to 13, 26 or 52 games. Training Camp mode allows you work on your pitching, hitting, fielding or running skills, and a General Manager mode lets you perform trades. An announcer will keep things lively by calling the action from the booth.</desc>

    <desc>150 years ago, the legendary warrior known as the Brave Fencer Musashi saved the kingdom of Allucaneet from the evil Wizard of Darkness. Now, his spirit is reincarnated in a young, rather short-tempered boy. Fillet, the princess of Allucaneet, summons the reluctant hero to the palace and gives him the powerful sword Fusion, which he needs to defeat the evil Thirstquencher Empire. It soon turns out that the Empire is after another legendary sword, Lumina, so Musashi's first task is to get it before the bad guys do!..

Brave Fencer Musashi is an action game with strong RPG elements. Controlling Musashi, the player explores the pre-rendered backgrounds from third person view (similarly to Final Fantasy VII), visiting towns, talking to NPCs, etc. There is a day/night cycle in the game, which is manifested in the schedules of NPCs and/or monsters, as well as Musashi's fatigue level, which increases if he doesn't sleep enough. Musashi uses the two swords, Fusion and Lumina, to fight his enemies. The two swords have different properties: while Fusion behaves more or less like a traditional melee weapon, Lumina needs to be imbued with various elemental items in order to unleash powerful attacks.</desc>

    <desc>Bravo Air Race is a different type of PlayStation racing game: instead of cars, you'll race with planes! There are a total of ten planes to initially choose from (including WWII style fighters and stunt planes), all differing in speed, acceleration and mobility. The types of aircraft include a Lightning, Mustang, Thunderbolt, Corsair, Zero Fighter, Sinden, Messerschmitt, Spitfire, Geebee, Pitts and two hidden planes. Once you select your plane, you'll be able to freely choose any of the four courses to race on: Canyon, Snow Land, South City or Mountain. Watch for arrows or listen to the announcer signaling when you need to turn, dive or climb as you make your way through the course.

Play involves racing against the computer for three laps while trying to cross the finish line first. Find yourself lagging behind? Pick up red balloons with an "S" inside them for extra speed! After winning, you can then race on another course, choose a different plane, or try your hand at a Time Attack mode. Besides the one-player game, you'll be able to race against a second player on a horizontally-split screen. While the courses are not entirely open, those still having difficulty can choose an option to turn on blue spheres. These spheres will form a line helping players navigate the winding courses. Bravo Air Race also includes two camera angles for either a behind-the-plane or inside-the-cockpit perspective.</desc>

The Breakout world of 2000 is an island filled with bizarre creatures in the form of paddles and balls. Bouncer enjoys his life their with Daisy, his beautiful girlfriend.

    <desc>George Stobbart is an American tourist spending his autumn vacation in Paris. He barely escapes a bombing of a caf&amp;#xE9; and decides to investigate the clues left behind by the killer. This eventually leads him to a mystery dating back to the legend of the Knights Templar.

Circle of Blood is the first part in the Broken Sword series. It is a third-person puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure game with 2D cartoon-like graphics. The player moves the character around using the mouse, examines the environment, talks to other people and collects items stored in an inventory. These items need to be used or combined with other items to solve puzzles. George gets help from Nicole Collard, a French journalist. The story is divided into eleven chapters and takes place in locations such as Paris, Ireland, Syria, and others.</desc>

Not just any race, but a race in which the participants ride on giant bugs. Choose from 22 different contestants, each with unique racing styles and weapon, and try to be the first to the finish line on six tracks. If finishing first is a little too tough, make your bug go faster by using your riding crop. But be careful, or your bug will quit running for you. For those looking for a less-than-honest way to win, collect power-ups and weapons scattered throughout the track to blow past your opponents or blast them out of the sky. And don't forget to keep your eyes open for the shortcuts in each track. Do you have the nerve and the skill to win the Great Race? Play BUG RIDERS: The Race of Kings and find out.</desc>

    <desc>Daffy Duck has somehow managing to break Granny's time regulator, causing himself and the Time Gem that acts as the heart of the regulator to be pitched back into the shrouded annals of history. Well, if there are two people you know to call when it comes to times of crisis they would be Bugs Bunny and ... Taz? Well, regardless of the intelligence of the decision, Bugs and Taz will have to work together on this mission, traveling through four different eras in a quest to find Daffy, recover the Time Gem and set things back to the way they ought to be.

Take control of the two famous Warner Bros. characters in Bugs Bunny &amp; Taz: Time Busters for the PlayStation. You will alternate between the wise-cracking rabbit and the Tasmanian eating machine in an attempt to rescue the Time Crystal and Daffy. To do so, they'll have to use the Time Regulator themselves, blasting back through four different eras to complete their quest. These time periods are The Aztec Era, The Viking Era, The Arabian Era and Transylvanian Era.

Each character has his own set of moves, from Bugs' quickness to Taz's spinning fury. You can play each of the characters at any point, calling your friend to your location and switching between them, occasionally using them at nearly the same time to get past a given obstacle. If you don't want to play the game alone, you can even bring in a second friend to play the other character.</desc>

Although a certain color can only eliminate itself, the object of this game is to match colored blocks together to form buildings. Once you have made a building, you can eliminate it by shooting a block on the corner of it. The larger the building, the more benefits you'll reap when you destroy it!

The game can be played three different ways: Puzzle mode, Battle mode, and Arcade mode. In the Puzzle mode, you must travel to one of seven different courses and construct specific size buildings. You must not destroy the buildings in this mode. The object is to build cities for the specific course or region you're in and make the cities grow.</desc>

There are two gameplay modes, Obstacle and Trick. In Obstacle mode, you race around a track and must complete the track in time and collect enough points by wake boarding through rings and over jumps. In Trick mode, you compete to score as many points as possible by performing tricks. There are over 45 tricks in total.</desc>

    <name>Bust-a-Move '99</name>
    <desc>In the tradition of the Bust-A-Move series, Taito's Bust-A-Move '99 is a traditional puzzle game. The main objective is to destroy or get rid of (by dropping) all the bubbles located within the stage. Once you do this, you'll graduate to the next level.

While the premise may sound simple, the logic and execution is not. Using a "bubble shooter", you must aim and shoot your bubbles to the top of the screen so that you can bring three bubbles of the same color together. When you do this, the bubbles will pop. One way to earn points is to have the popping bubbles as well as the bubble that was shot fall off the screen (in multi-player, it puts these bubbles on your opponent's side). This also gives you a lot less bubbles to take care of.

Bubbles are constantly falling down. Popping them all in a short amount of time is necessary because the longer it takes you to pop them all, the faster they will drop. If you fail to clear out all the bubbles and they reach the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

Bust-A-Move '99 contains some new options never seen in the Bust-A-Move series. There are now special bubbles (star, metal and rainbow to name a few), obstructive bubbles and blocks and new backgrounds. You are also given the opportunity to create your very own stages with the create-a-level editor.</desc>

Collection is a compilation of Capcom's "Buster" arcade series -- released over a period of six years from 1989 to 1995. Gameplay presents a blend of puzzle and action that sees players strafing from side-to-side, shooting vertically at the bubbles that bounce around the arena. Enclosed within the confines of a single, 2D arena, one or two players must utilize their rope-gun devices to destroy the deluge of bubbles that inundate the screen. When hit, the bubbles burst into multiple, smaller segments, and will continue to do so until the smallest bubble is destroyed. Only by clearing the screen can players proceed. However, coming into contact with a bubble will result in the immediate loss of a life.</desc>

At first, the purpose of the invasion is unknown, but to the horror of all surviving humans, the objective soon becomes clear: the aliens plan to harvest all non-radioactive carbon from planet Earth (thus the title C-12).

Most of the human race has been decimated, and those captured alive are used for "droning," the process by which the aliens reprogram humans into cyborg warriors.

It is up to you, playing as resistance fighter Riley Vaughan, to save the Earth from impending doom. Armed with an imaging unit that has been implanted to replace his left eye, as well as a powerful arsenal of weapons, Vaughan must complete tasks, collect items, and destroy the enemy in order to carry out his missions and uncover the secrets behind the alien invasion.</desc>

It doesn't stop there, however. Each track has six increasingly difficult levels that can only be unlocked after placing first on the previous stage. These tracks will offer different times of day, alternate paths, and new obstacles such as boulders to negotiate -- bringing the total number of courses to 36 variants.

Other features include your choice of eight official Car and Driver racing teams, a Season mode where you race for points, and a single-player race against seven computer-controlled vehicles. The game also supports two-player split-screen racing as well as a link-up mode for up to four players on two television sets. In addition, season points, option settings and unlocked courses can all be saved to memory card. The Grand Tour Champion has yet to be decided, are you up to the challenge?</desc>

    <name>CART World Series</name>
    <desc>CART World Series a game for the PlayStation, published and developed by Sony Computer Entertainment and released on September 16, 1997. CART World Series is based on the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) open-wheel racing series.

This game is licensed and features many notable drivers from the late 1990s, such as Greg Moore, Al Unser Jr. and Paul Tracy. The game also features 10 authentic tracks as well as realistic handling and damage. Players can compete in a full year's worth of races competing for points in each race or in simple single races. There are two game modes: arcade and simulation. Arcade mode allows re-spawning of damaged vehicle parts. In Simulation mode, all damage is permanent for the race. The game supports the analog controller.

The play can make many modifications to a car's performance. The player can: adjust the tires to fit the road (hard for ovals or soft for road courses), as well as modify gear ratios and aerodynamics. Moving the front of the car down or slanting the wings may enable the player to find a perfect combination of speed and handling. During simulation mode races, the car's tires will wear down and fuel will deplete (both can be replaced by a pit stop).

In addition to the real drivers and cars (Honda and Ford included), ten official CART tracks have been included &amp;#x2013; each modeled after its real-life counterpart. Tracks span the United States and are located in Cleveland, Michigan, Long Beach and more. Each features realistic dynamics and road handling in an attempt to create a believable racing experience. In Season Mode, the player will take part in a series of races, for which the player must qualify and race, earning points toward a cup.</desc>

    <desc>Five years ago, Richter Belmont, the latest in the Belmont lineage and the one destined to be a Vampire Hunter, defeated Dracula in a brutal battle which nearly cost him the love of his life, Annette, and her sister, Maria. Now, Richter has suddenly vanished, CastleVania has mysteriously reappeared, and Maria, now a young woman, sets off to find Richter. Alucard, the son of Dracula, is awakened from his eternal slumber after this large shift in power, and enters into Castlevania to find some answers and perhaps destroy the castle once again.

Symphony of the Night is a direct sequel to Dracula X: Rondo of Blood. The game is set in a castle which you can explore freely with many different paths, although often items in certain areas need to be found that will allow passage to others. The action-based gameplay incorporates now strong RPG elements. The hero receives experience points for defeating enemies, gains levels and becomes more powerful. There is also money to be found in the game, and various accessories to buy. In a separate screen, players need to equip attack weapons, shields and other items. Magic plays an important role, as well as secondary weapons and a large amount of "special moves" that are executed similar to advanced one-on-one fighting games.</desc>

Navigation between areas is conducted via an overworld map, much like Chrono Trigger's, depicting the landscape from a scaled down overhead view. Around the island world are villages, outdoor areas, and dungeons, through which the player moves in three dimensions. Locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Like Chrono Trigger, the game features no random encounters; enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party</desc>

    <desc>CIRCUIT BREAKERS is new kind of racing game. Rather than racing on road courses, the tracks are more like roller coaster rides, with hairpin turns and drastic drops. And, like a roller coaster, there are no walls to keep you on the track. So, missing a turn will throw you into the abyss and cost you valuable time. Your ability to stay on course is tested in three play modes: World Series, Battle, and Time Trial. In World Series, try to beat seven opponents in 16 different races. Battle mode allows you to challenge three friends to a race. If you find the track too crowded, tackle the Time Trial mode and create new world records for each track. In all modes, the courses are littered with power ups including rocket boosters, shrinkers, and oil slicks that give the player a competitive edge. If you're tired of the same old racing games, give CIRCUIT BREAKERS a try.</desc>

    <desc>Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.

As you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.

There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.</desc>

    <desc>Cleopatra Fortune was originally released as an arcade title by Taito in 1996 and was followed by a Sega Dreamcast version in 2001 from Japanese publisher Altron Corporation. Renamed Cleopatra's Fortune, this block dropping Tetris-styled puzzle game now reaches the U.S. on the PlayStation with gameplay nearly identical to its predecessors. Players can select from four modes of play: Arcade, Versus, Mystery and Time Attack.

Utilizing an Egyptian-style motif, block types include Rock, Mummy, Gem, and Sarcophagus, each with specific characteristics and "line" requirements that affect removal from the stacks of blocks that accumulate as they fall and pile up. Blocks can be removed in several ways using combos, enclosures, lines, and pyramid stones. Each mode features a unique objective, ranging from solving 50 Sphinx riddles in Mystery mode to the frenetic ten-stage action of Time Attack.</desc>

    <desc>Clock Tower is a point and click survival horror game, with the player controlling a cursor to direct the character and give commands such as to investigate objects. The interface is akin to 1990-era computer adventure games, but simplified to work better with a gamepad.

The game is separated into three scenarios, including a prologue during which the main character for the rest of the game is decided. In the prologue, the player controls Samuel Barton. In the first scenario, the player either plays as Jennifer Simpson or Helen Maxwell. The playable character for the second scenario can either be Nolan, Stan, or Helen. Between each scenario, there is additionally an intermission, in which the player can explore the town and gather clues via a 'world map' before moving on to the next level.</desc>

It is a spin-off to the Clock Tower series and has almost nothing to do with the previous games besides its gameplay.

Following its predecessors, the gameplay is more about hiding and solving puzzles, rather than fighting the player's pursuers. This degenerates as the plot advances, and the main character is eventually forced to use guns and other tools in several endgame action sequences.

Its interface consists of a point-and-click system similar to the one used by Sierra Entertainment games, such as the Gabriel Knight series. There is an inventory screen that appears if the user drags the pointer to the upper side of the screen. The game's engine looks similar to Clock Tower 2 (Clock Tower in North America), with a few minor alterations.</desc>

    <desc>Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth. To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death.

The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies. After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell.

Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space. You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet. Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them.

The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations.</desc>

Within Sol, the Earth Empire civilization has fallen apart. Various tribes and factions, warring with one another have left the once great home system of humanity a wreck of salvage and waste from used up resources. One leader however, a Commander Kron, seeks to unite the warring clans under a banner of vengeance... and together find some way to break out from this solar prison.

The game is space combat, done from a cockpit view. Different combinations of weapons can be equipped on your space fighter prior to launch. Missions take place in space as well as inside planet atmospheres. Various buttons cycle weapons, activate tractor beams, communicate responses and navigate your ship. In typical space combat fashion, you are equipped with 360 degrees of movement as well as thrust and braking options. The game does not feature realistic inertia and objects will gradually "slow" in space.</desc>

It also included 19 exclusive briefing FMV (full-motion video) clips that were not in any of the PC expansion packs, which had none. All of the videos are shown when the player either starts playing through the operational theatre from the beginning or when all the missions of the theatre are accomplished.

    <desc>Contender 2 is a sequel to the first Contender boxing game which was released in early 1999. This second release is similar to the original in terms of gameplay. The game allows up to four different modes of play. The "Main Event" mode offers a rewarding challenge to patient gamers.

Here, players start with a young, fresh boxer and build him up towards the ultimate goal, Champion of the World. Pre-made novice fighters are available as choices in a new game, or the player can design his own boxer from scratch. As the fighter progresses, he actually becomes bigger and more muscular on screen. Similarly, as he gets beat up in a fight, bruises and wounds appear on the character to remind you of his pain.

Do you have what it takes to be a contender? Step into the ring with more than a dozen of the hardest-hitting fighters the world has ever known and find out.</desc>

    <desc>Aliens have infested the earth once more, and all is lost unless you step into the fray and take action against these otherworldly inhabitants. Contra: Legacy of War is a continuation of the long-running saga that started back on the Nintendo Entertainment System where a lone solider, with the choice of a partner (two-player mode) is faced with the pending threat of a total world domination by galactic creatures. You must battle your way level through hellish level in order to reach the final confrontation with the supreme entity. You wont be unprepared, however. There are numerous weapons and power-ups at your disposal, so, choose wisely soldier, the world is counting on you.

Blast through six levels of running, jumping, and shooting action. Along the way, use classic CONTRA weapons like the spread gun, and few new ones, like the powerful flame-thrower and homing rounds.

CONTRA gets a new look with 3D environments and character models. To make the action pop out of the screen, put on the special glasses included in the package and play in the 3D mode.</desc>

    <name>Cool Boarders</name>
    <desc>The first title in the long-running PlayStation snowboarding series.

Imagine riding down the slopes, avoiding the trees and trying to hit the jumps. When you catch enough air, you grab your board, twist, and land a perfect trick. 

Choose from several different riders and 10 boards, and then hit one of the five courses. On each track you can earn three different trophies: one trophy is awarded for getting down the hill in the quickest time; catch big air to pull off big tricks to earn the highest trick point trophy; or win the final trophy by getting the highest total score, which is based on both time and trick points.

If the competition seems a little rough, race against the ghost from your last run and find a smoother line down the mountain.</desc>

    <name>Countdown Vampires</name>
    <desc>Because Capcom's Resident Evil single-handedly created the modern survival horror genre, the critically acclaimed adventure spawned countless sequels and clones. Conceived by Bandai Digital Entertainment, Countdown Vampires is one of those clones -- you will maneuver 3D characters throughout 2D backgrounds in a series of fixed camera angles while fending off unspeakable horrors.

As a police officer, Keith J. Snyder has been assigned a security position at the grand opening of Desert Moon -- a hotel casino with a horror theme located in Casino City. While overseeing security and making sure VIPs aren't being hurt at the dance club, something goes horribly wrong. As a sudden fire causes sprinklers to go off, the water turns black and transforms the dancers into murderous vampire monsters. Assuming the role of the brave police detective, a civic servant and the last remaining human alive, Snyder must unravel the mysteries of the black water while defending himself against multiple monstrosities.

Armed initially with a tranquilizer gun, a shock glove and an unlimited supply of vampire-destroying white water, Keith J. Snyder will find and utilize twelve weapons and items throughout the course of his adventure. Also located throughout the hotel casino are computer terminals, maps of the area and vending machines in which helpful items are sold; at computer terminals, he can access an e-mail program that furthers the storyline.

In Countdown Vampires, Snyder's physical health is represented by a color-based condition gauge found in the inventory screen; green indicates a healthy body, yellow represents wounded and red coloring is fatal as Snyder approaches death. You can heal the character using various health items found throughout the casino. In addition to looking out for your character's health, you will solve various puzzles and seek out specific keys and cards for locked doors.</desc>

Helping Crash in his journey is an ancient witch doctor spirit named Aku Aku, who has scattered masks of himself throughout the islands to grant Crash special powers.

Another game places characters on the backs of polar bears as they try to ram each other off the sides of an iceberg, with variants that include melting ice and playfield angles that change with your location. Each game features variations; some allow for two-player teams.</desc>

    <desc>Creatures: Raised in Space is essentially a Playstation port of the pet simulator game Creatures 3, with modified gameplay mechanics. As in the previous titles, the player controls a fairy named Scrubby, who acts through the cursor issuing orders to the Norns when used over interactive portions of the scenery. Like in other life simulation games with artificial intelligence, the creatures can't be commanded directly and must learn behavior patterns through repeated actions. The Norns can get sick or exhausted and eventually die, and one of the main tasks is to manage the colony to avoid their demise, ensuring that all its inhabitants are well-fed and healthy by eating fruits and consuming medicinal herbs. A series of meters at the bottom of the screen show the population status.

The game takes place in space, inside a giant station with a domed ceiling protecting a closed ecosystem. The main objective is to open all the rooms, by ordering a Norn to carry a key to unlock a door or passage. Deeper levels have aggressive enemies and poisonous plants that have to be avoided by the Norns. There are blue stars scattered throughout the scenery, and the creatures can be trained to fetch and store them inside a machine, generating a new key after twenty-five stars. Norns can breed and lay eggs, producing offspring that takes some minutes to reach maturity.</desc>

This game is basically a demolition derby which permits the usage of ballistic projectiles, but occurs under water and every vehicle used in it are submarines. Players choose a sub and an arena in single mode to engage in fights with opposing sailors. A variety of weapons and upgrades are obtainable by pick-ups scattered throughout the stage as well as each sub having their own exclusive "special weapon". The goal on an arena is to retrieve all five pods, which are scattered throughout the level, and find the escape gateway. Each pod gives its holder an extra power.

This game also features three modes of play: a mission/story mode, where the player (or two players cooperatively) can battle through eleven levels; a battle mode, where the player captures pods in a selectable level; and deathmatch, where the player battles against the computer or another human in a split-screen mode.</desc>

    <desc>As No Remorse opens, a trio of Silencers&amp;#x2014;enigmatic super-soldiers&amp;#x2014;are returning from a botched mission in which they disobeyed an order to fire upon civilians who were (mistakenly) believed to be rebels. They are ambushed by a WEC mech, and two of the Silencers are killed. The remaining one, a nameless captain, (whom the player plays as), joins the Resistance, where, as a significant symbol of the WEC's military power and political philosophy, he meets with resentment, distrust and outright hatred. However, he uncomplainingly undertakes dangerous missions, often with substandard equipment, and his continued success gradually earns the respect of his fellow Resistance members.

The Captain eventually uncovers secret plans for a WEC space station, the Vigilance Platform, which can attack any location on Earth from space, meaning cities with a known Resistance presence can simply be annihilated at the leisure of the WEC. All such cities are threatened with orbital bombardment unless they surrender. Concurrently, the player's Resistance cell is betrayed from within, and almost all the non-player characters are killed. Despite these setbacks, the Captain infiltrates the Vigilance Platform and destroys it. The traitor is also on the station, guarding the lifepods, and challenges the Silencer to a duel over the access card for the last pod. As the Vigilance Platform is exploding, the Captain is contacted by Chairman Draygan, who swears vengeance against the Silencer.</desc>

    <desc>Light-gun games have been rather sparse on the Playstation, but CRYPT KILLERS tries to remedy that. The game starts with an ancient legend: an ancient civilization existed before the more recent civilizations of the Mayans and Egyptians, but that civilization suddenly disappeared. Some believe that aliens visited the ancient civilization and left behind crystals that allowed people to travel through time. These crystals became known as the Eyes of Guidance. The search for the crystals has heated up since more information has been discovered; you know the locations of the eyes and want to claim them. Move through six levels of catacombs, tombs, tunnels, and rivers while blasting skeletons, spiders, zombies, and rats. If using the standard controller makes life too difficult, plug in any Playstation compatible light gun and let the good times roll. Do you have the skills and reflexes to survive CRYPT KILLERS?</desc>

    <name>Dance Dance Revolution</name>
    <desc>One of the world's most influential games makes its way out of Japan for a home-based dance experience like no other. Using a big dance mat (sold separately), you'll step to the beat of the song playing, executing a specific set of moves to a tee. Your cues will come from the screen in the form of four columns of instructions that scroll upwards. Score points by nailing the timing of each step and getting the order of moves correct. The action will get faster and more furious as the game progresses, instructing you to pull off trickier combos in more limited time periods. As in the Japanese release of the game, a Diet mode shows you how many calories you're burning. To account for the steep learning curve, DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION even includes a Training mode to get you started. Packed with remixes of old songs and brand-new gems, the soundtrack boasts 27 danceable tunes. Though it's possible to play without the dance mat, working up a sweat is half the fun of this inventive game.</desc>

    <desc>Dead in the Water is all about the thrills, chills, and spills of powerboat racing. Choose from 14 different boats, and then hit one of the nine courses, each with unique obstacles, conditions, and jumps. After winning a race, upgrade your weapons to keep a tactical advantage over the competition. If racing for speed is not your style, play the battle mode and try to destroy all of your opponents. Thanks to the realistic water physics, swells will throw your boat into the air, currents will affect your speed based on their direction, and landing hard after a jump will put the boat under water and cause a major slowdown. Can you handle all of the action of Dead in the Water?</desc>

    <name>Delta Force: Urban Warfare</name>
    <desc>Delta Force: Urban Warfare is the first Delta Force game developed by UK based Rebellion. Urban Warfare features a new AI system unique to the PlayStation. It will offer players a squad of characters with special military abilities, a variety of fast-paced new missions, and hi-tech weapons. The franchise is modeled after the British Special Air Service (SAS), which served as an overseas counter-terrorist unit and specialized in rescuing hostages.

You are a lone Delta Force operative. You must eliminate terrorists who may be hidden behind any door, and halt a global threat. This is an all-new Delta Force experience, based on the successful franchise developed exclusively for the PlayStation by Rebellion.

Gameplay ranges from wild shootouts to stealth tactics, and includes close-quarters combat, strategic infiltration, time-sensitive ops, sniping, and demolition. You will engage enemies who react to gunfire, dive for cover, employ tactical maneuvers, and pursue using a player's blood trail. Weapons include assault and sniper rifles, grenade and rocket launchers, plus remote explosives. Other gear includes night vision and thermal goggles, combat radar, and a security camera scrambler.</desc>

    <desc>Demolition Racer is a racing game with a twist. Rather than a game that just requires you to try and win the race, this game gives you points to destroy the other racers' cars. The game has many styles of game play so you don't have to play the same style each game.

There are 5 game styles in the Single Race section of the game. This section does not count towards unlocking cars or tracks. It is for practice and just plain fun. The main style is Demolition.

In Demolition, you race against other cars around the track and get points for hitting them, spinning them in circles and knocking them into the wall. You also get a big bonus for landing on top of a car which will immediately destroy the car. When you finish the race, your final position is found by multiplying the points you got from hitting the other cars with the points that you got for the position you finished in. So if you finish first, but never hit anyone, you won't win the race.</desc>

    <desc>Thousands of years ago, a people known as the Strega came to the country of Zamuel offering the secrets of peace and understanding. With them they brought great knowledge and power and shared gifts with the people to exercise powers such as those the Strega had. They showed the path towards true enlightenment, but underestimated the overwhelming drive of human greed and ambition.

Now Lord Zauber has gained the control of the Strega relics. He seeks to wipe out any opposition to him and hunt down descendants of the Strega and eradicate them.

Possibly one of the most in-depth fighting adventures to date, Destrega melds role playing with fighting. Moving freely within an environment that includes castle ruins, underground caverns and wide open countryside, you must discover the secret of the legendary relics, learn the truth behind the Strega and stop the Zauber's evil ambitions.</desc>

The player can both stand atop dice, and stand on the ground (with the dice towering above). When standing on the dice, the player can move from die to die, or can roll a die in the direction he or she runs, revealing a different face as the die rotates. Creating a group of adjacent dice with identical pips&amp;#x2014;the size of which must be at least the number of pips&amp;#x2014;causes those dice to slowly sink into the field before disappearing. Chain reactions are possible by adding additional dice to a sinking set. Different types of dice are available in some modes, with different properties to make the game more challenging.</desc>

Most Digimon originally called File Island home, but for some unknown reason over time they lost the ability to speak and now live a nomadic lifestyle.

It is your goal to roam the dangerous countryside with your trained Digimon battling other lost Digimon. A victorious battle permits them to return home to the abandoned File Island. The main one-player mode on Digimon World is where the mysterious story unfolds as you raise your immature Digimon. Digimon are dependant on you for happiness, food, and parental guidance to guide their behavior (similar to the popular Tamagotchi toy).

Digimon mature while "working out" in the training area and as you battle various Digimon in the surrounding areas. Your pet Digimon can compete against friends' Digimon in Battle Mode that provides an arena for head-to-head combat. A loss against a friend can provide plenty of initiative to return to the main mode to strengthen your Digimon, but you'll need one block of free space on the memory card to save your progress.</desc>

    <desc>Dino Crisis is a survival horror game that is very similar in both control and gameplay to its sister series, Resident Evil. As in that series, protagonist Regina will have limited supplies and ammo with which to fight deadly enemies while searching rooms for keys (some figurative, some literal) to open locked areas. Unlike Resident Evil games, Regina will find very few actual supplies laying around, and will instead find "plugs" that are used to open caches of emergency supplies located around the complex. There are only enough plugs to open some of these caches, however, so care must be taken to decide what items are really needed. In another change from Resident Evil, the game is rendered in 3D, allowing the camera to rotate or pan, although camera angles are still out of the control of the player. Even the dumbest dinosaur is smarter than the undead, and enemies can chase and disarm Regina, and even occasionally follow her through doors.</desc>

    <desc>The game itself follows the films' storyline loosely. The player can choose the role of one of two dalmatians, Oddball or Domino, who are out in the backyard looking for treasure. It is not long before the player realizes that a toy found buried in a park was made at one of Cruella de Vil's toy factories; this alludes to the fact that Cruella's toy sales are down, which ultimately leads to the problem in the storyline. Facing financial ruin from lack of sales, Cruella sets an evil plan in motion - to reprogram her toys to capture any pets in sight. Oddball and Domino are the only puppies in their family who have not been captured when they return from the park. Their parents, Dottie and Dipstick, set out to rescue their puppies, commanding Oddball and Domino to stay home and 'be good.' The puppies do not listen, and are soon out on their biggest adventure yet - to save their brothers and sisters, and their parents who are captured along the way.</desc>

    <desc>Lilo, a young Hawaiian girl, and Stitch, a multi-limbed alien, are the stars of the aptly titled Lilo &amp; Stitch -- a platform romp based upon the Disney movie of the same name. Following much the same formula as other 3D platformers, the game puts the two unlikely protagonists through a series of levels in and around the island of Hawaii. Together they will discover the true meaning of "Ohana" (Hawaiian for family). The gameplay, patterned closely upon the system's other platform star, Crash Bandicoot, sees players taking control of one of the two characters at a time as they navigate 2D side scrolling levels as well as linear 3D portions of the world.

Regardless of the currently active character, the objectives remain much the same, as the two pint-sized heroes break the pots and crates in their path and collect coffee mugs, flowers, leaves, and other such objects littered about the island. Aside from being able to jump, each character possesses a unique attack, allowing them to defend themselves from the throngs of indigenous bugs, lizards, and porcupines that inhabit the island. A handful of mini-games, such as a timed race against an opponent, are interspersed between the platform-jumping portions of the game. Throughout the quest, players will encounter familiar characters from the movie, including Jumba Jookiba, Pleakley, and Captain Gantu. As an added bonus, hidden photos and movie clips can be uncovered during play.</desc>

Mushu is warned not to drop the scrolls because the magic will fall out of them if he does. Mushu drops the scrolls anyway when Cri-Kee comes from behind and startles him. Now Mushu must regain the lost scrolls and place the magic back in them.

The game is basically an interactive storybook where the player helps the story move forward by completing certain tasks. Some of these tasks include retrieving items requested by Grandma Fa, dressing up Mulan and Mushu with a variety of hats, tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories, playing a mix and match puzzle to obtain armor, and figuring out the correct order gongs should be hit in order to awake Mulan's ancestors. A sample of some of the other activities include playing Mahjong and throwing snowballs at enemy soldiers. The game also lets the player have a sing along karaoke-style to three songs from the movie. There is also an activity that let's players place cut-outs of characters and locations experienced during the game onto a sheet of paper which can then be colored in using a paint set.</desc>

With the aid of his friends at Star Command Mira, Booster, and X-R Buzz will battle Emperor Zurg, Gravatina, Torque, Skreel, and others in 14 levels that span seven different worlds.

    <desc>Dragonheart: Fire and Steel was released to the public in 1996, and is a 2D side scrolling beat 'em up based off of the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of a retired knight who must return to action and remain true to the oaths he took long ago. An evil prince's tyranny threatens the land, and the knight (who was a former dragonslayer) can only defeat this scheming noble with the help of a friend who just happens to be the last surviving dragon on Earth.

Players must punch, kick, and slash their way through multiple levels in their quest, facing off against both weak and powerful enemies bent on stopping them. At the end of each level boss characters stand ready to slay the player, who must defeat them to continue, for retreat is not an option. Rendered and digitized graphics are used in the game to represent the backgrounds and characters respectively, though the title runs in a low graphic resolution.</desc>

    <name>Dune 2000</name>
    <desc>From the developers at Westwood Studios comes Dune 2000, a real-time strategy game. Throughout the planet of Arrakis (a desert-like planet riddled with dunes and sand), three military powers have engaged in a fierce war to control a most prized resource known as the Spice Melange. The mysterious spice can only be found on the planet of Arrakis; every race in the known universe lusts for its power.

With all the bickering and fighting over Spice Melange, the Emperor has issued a challenge that basically states whoever controls the substance will control Arrakis. The three aforementioned forces include the noble House Atreides, the wicked House Harkonnen, and the enigmatic House Ordos. Not only does each house desire control, they also have different reasons for entering the war.

The House Atreides loathes and fears the evil forces of the Harkonnen and wishes to form an alliance with the Fremen, strange sand-dwelling warriors that inhabit the bowels of the planet. The nobles function much like a normal army, giving commands for the side of good. On the other hand, House Harkonnen is run by a tyrannical baron that demands victory. These blood-drinking savages enjoy battles and chaos more than the actual victory; they reign with widespread fear. House Ordos is a bit more unorthodox than their warring brethren. Led by cyborg-like officers, they go into battle with a strategic mentality and play for the odds. Gut feelings aren't acceptable in their society. Having arrived with Lady Alara on the desertous Arrakis, she has enlisted you as a commander of one of the three military powers. Her sisterhood is hoping that you will be victorious with that house above all others, as to create a clear faction in control of the Spice Melange in which her Order could form an alliance.

After selecting the house of your liking, a commander will give you a military briefing and objective. As a 3D real-time strategy game, you'll begin by constructing a series of battle units, important housing structures (walls, construction yards, barracks, outposts) and vehicles; this is vital in order to meet the mission objective. You'll start the scenario with a power supply for building a Spice Melange refinery to generate money. Afterwards, it's up to you to build a fully operational base. Upon completion of the necessary structures, it's time to attack your opposition! You'll command and control a wide variety of light infantry soldiers, troopers, saboteurs, and the aforementioned Fremen.

Dune 2000 also supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller for analog movements and the vibration function. It also comes with mouse support. You can utilize any PlayStation memory card for saving game data and options.</desc>

    <desc>E.T. may have left Earth safely onboard his spaceship, but trouble awaits him soon after landing in this 3D PlayStation adventure. The universe is in danger and only E.T. can help save it, by finding exotic plants. As the kind-hearted alien from the 1982 film, re-released in 2002 to commemorate its 20th anniversary, players must rescue rare plants from a total of five planets: Green Planet, Ice Planet, Desert Planet, Planet Metropolis, and Earth. Each planet contains a specific number of plants to find across three levels.

Worlds are also filled with hostile creatures or government agents, so E.T. needs to use his special powers to help him overcome all manner of threats. As E.T. walks and runs across the levels, he can call upon the power of telekinesis to move items closer, use his healing power to restore flowers, and unleash a heart stun to temporarily freeze enemies. Also available on each level are items such as keys or switches, which let E.T. access blocked areas. Progress in the adventure can be saved to a memory card.</desc>

    <desc>Charlie has really done it this time. While reaching for his beloved donuts, he accidently spilled coffee on his work station at the MomSteel Steel Factory. Now the machinery has taken on a life of its own! Assume control of Charlie the Egg in your effort to find the reset switch located somewhere within the factory. The game consists of 43 pre-rendered levels and 12 boss characters, all of which are various forms of machinery, from Blast Furnace Bill to Rotato the Repair Robot.

In order to clear a level, Charlie must locate a certain number of time clocks and hit them with his wrench. To reach the clocks, he'll need to walk across narrow ledges, spinning gears, and past open flames. Besides using the wrench, Charlie can also jump, throw bolts and roll away. Items to look out for are paper airplanes (they'll give you information or clues), donuts to replenish any damage, coins to give you extra lives and fans to cool you down. After all, moving through a hot steel factory can be especially dangerous to an egg. The game automatically saves your progress to memory card, so keep moving and save that factory!

The most notable feature of the game is the number of impressive CG cinemas that play constantly throughout your adventure. If you fall off an edge, you'll see Charlie do a Humpty Dumpty impression, and if you make it to the next level by punching the last time clock, a transition scene will play.</desc>

    <desc>In 2192, a new city, Selene, is built on the moon. Over the years, Selene grows larger, more powerful, and more independent of the Earth - to the point that the moon and Earth battle in a war that winds down without a definite victory for either side. In 2242, war breaks out again - the Earth slowly begins to win... except for the efforts of an experimental Selene technology known as Einh&amp;#xE4;nders: flying machines with a "hand" that allows them to change weaponry mid-battle.

On December 12, 2245, Selene sends down 3 Einh&amp;#xE4;nders in a last attempt to turn the tide of the war. You get to choose the craft to pilot, and it's up to you to battle your way through the Earth's monstrous defenses and win the battle.

The game is a traditional side-scrolling shooter, with rendered 3D backgrounds and enemies. The atmosphere of the game is very "industrial", down to the German industrial music playing in the background (think Einsturzende Neubauten mixed with Lords of Acid). The weapon-switching and claiming is an integral part of the game, as weapons have limited shots. This forces a bit more strategy than the usual button-mashing shooters inspire.</desc>

    <desc>The Mappets have shielded the land of Gross from war and destruction for close to 1,000 years. But the evil General Vorless has stolen the Soul Sword and is using it to destroy the Mappets. With the Mappets out of the way, he hopes to awaken Luna, the Goddess of Destruction, and rule the land unopposed.

Luca and his sister Elena are two orphans, living in a small house in the kingdom of Gross. They have two good friends - Mouse and Nicol. One day, while exploring a local cave, the four youths find a mysterious jewel. Later, they travel to the city of Goondocks, where they find a similar jewel - along with a note left to them by Luke's and Elena's parents. They learn that their parents belonged to an ancient race named "Eternal Eyes" - people who could control inanimate dolls called Mappets. Now the four heroes have to learn the power of controlling Mappets, and to stop a villain from resurrecting the Goddess of Destruction.

The heart and soul of the game is battle, with all of the battles taking place on 3D isometric fields inhabited by 2D sprites. Every character has unique skills that must be employed during the fight to succeed. Luckily, there are also 150 Mappets that can be collected to help give you an edge in combat. Play ETERNAL EYES and help Luca save the world and the Mappets.</desc>

    <desc>Originally released in Japan a few months ago as the tongue-twistingly titled Eretzvaju, Titus has picked up the projectile-based fighter and released it in the States as the hilariously named Evil Zone. An amalgamation of Psychic Force and Destrega, Evil Zone is a projectile-based 3D fighter that adds a dynamic element lacking from most of today's fighting games. Developed by Yuke's, the team behind the successful (in Japan at least) Toukon Retsuden series, and the not so successful Soukaigi (Square's recent action RPG), Evil Zone is a refreshing surprise from a development team not known for fighting games.

The premise in Evil Zone centers around the main character, Danvaizer, a superhero in the mold of classic Japanese afternoon TV shows (a la Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, etc.). While the storyline is truly superfluous, it nevertheless suffices as reason enough to gather Danvaizer and nine other combatants together to do battle in a distinctly different manner than most other fighting games.</desc>

    <desc>The game is called Expendable in The United States and Millenium Soldier Expendable in Europe.

Taking place in 2463 AD, the world has been consumed in chaos and countless confrontations with a powerful, technologically advanced alien race known as the Charva that want Earth and the human race destroyed. Before things get too out of hand, the government is sending expendables into action. An expendable is one viewed as not worth saving; their lives are pretty much worthless and won't be missed incase something bad were to happen. In this case, they are genetically altered superhuman killing machines incubated and hatched from eggs.

This would be you, a cloned space marine.

Going solo or with a friend in the simultaneous two-player Cooperative mode, Expendable offers explosive third-person action from an overhead perspective with a single mission objective: to destroy the Charva forces and anything that even remotely resembles a threat to the human race. Sounds simple? It's not; not only are there hundreds of enemies to kill throughout infested marine bases, alien planets and city streets (over 20 levels in all), you're also competing against a dwindling time limit. You'll have to go sightseeing on someone else's time!</desc>

Featuring real circuits from the 1999 Formula One season, F-1 RACING CHAMPIONSHIP boasts the inclusion of the brand new Sepang track in Malaysia.

    <desc>F1 World Grand Prix: 1999 Season from Eidos Interactive is a Formula One racing game that is based on the 1999 world championship racing event. The game puts you in the seat of the 22nd participant in the races. You are given a firsthand view of the challenging competition that real racers face every day.

The game features full FOA support so all 11 of the real teams and 22 drivers are included. Each car is also modeled accurately from its real counterpart, down to its smallest details. The developers in fact insist that if you are able to drive well, your lap times for the different circuits should be very similar to the real ones from the 1999 season. The tracks are also replicated from the immediate area surrounding it, to the areas well beyond the normal scope of a racing game.</desc>

    <desc>This version of the FIFA series contained over 40 "classic" teams, so that gamers could play as retired football legends.

It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer, replacing the fictitious "American" league previously included, as well as national leagues from Denmark, Greece, Israel, Norway and Turkey (though Galatasaray S.K. is not present in the game).

The game features over 40 national sides, fully integrated seasons, set piece selections, increased physical contact, new facial animations, shielding ability and tougher tackling.

The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay, a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more "emotion" to the 3d player models. The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival.

The opening video for FIFA 2000 features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game, then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1994 - the year of the inauguration of FIFA. The game also included Port Vale, the club supported by Williams, in the "Rest of the World" section (they were in Football League 1 at the time, and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition, teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with FIFA 2004).</desc>

Over 50 international teams, including England, France, Germany, Holland, Spain, and the United States have made the cut, while 17 of the planet's top leagues have been incorporated as well. New motion captured moves from Matthaus, Mendieta, Scholes, and other soccer legends support the game's realism, with animated linesman and authentic light sourcing add that much more to the presentation. Perhaps the most important features, though, are the advanced sets of artificial intelligence, in-game cinematic cutscenes, and a ton of game modes that have been specially built for tournaments from around the world.</desc>

    <desc>This was the third FIFA title in a little over a year. It incorporates 42 national sides, as well as 250 club teams from 12 different leagues, to play a complete true-to-life season, the preset Super League, or a league or cup of your own design. Formations and tactics can be set, and players can be moved between teams. 

Gameplay can be viewed from multiple angles. Players have more animation than ever before, with new moves including sliding challenges and close-control trapping. Goalkeepers now have a level of human control.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA Football 2002 (known as FIFA Soccer 2002: Major League Soccer in North America, and FIFA 2002: Road to FIFA World Cup in Japan), commonly known as FIFA 2002, is a football video game released in 2001, produced by Electronic Arts and released by EA Sports. FIFA 2002 is the ninth game in the FIFA series.

Power bars for passes were introduced, and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level. The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer's preference. The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV, AFC Ajax and Feyenoord, although there was no Dutch league of any kind (they were under the "Rest of World" header). This game also features, for the first time, the Swiss Super League, at the cost of excluding the Greek League. A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where, after winning a particular competition, a star player card is unlocked. There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup (France, Japan and South Korea), in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies.

Many of the international teams in the game are not licensed (some of them down to the players' names like the Netherlands), as well as smaller countries such as Barbados, who were only given numbers as player names. Also, to date, this was the last FIFA edition (not counting the World Cup versions) to feature the Japanese national team, since Japan Football Association would go on to concede exclusive rights to Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series.

FIFA Football 2002 ran for 10 years as the last FIFA to have only one person as cover, before Lionel Messi appeared alone on FIFA 13.</desc>

    <desc>FIFA 2003 continues the trend of improving each year's new release by keeping the formula that worked, while also adding new features to make the game more enjoyable.

Some of these new features including a "Freestyle" control, which is activated by the right thumbstick, causing you to do special moves, such as a deke, or kick the ball a fair length forwards to gain some speed.

New and improved "dead ball" control makes corner kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and gives you more options. The passing game has been improved as to allow better passing by kicking directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in particular, or open passing to allow anybody to take it.

FIFA 2003 includes all FIFA clubs, leagues, and players.</desc>

Once again, players are treated to a comprehensive lineup of teams and players, with over 500 official licenses that include Major League Soccer as well as the top teams from Europe and South America.

The stars will compete within a number of authentic stadiums, with the atmosphere further heightened by a number of additional crowd chants over previous titles in the series. A feature referred to as "Off the Ball Control" lets players guide those apart from whoever is in possession of the ball, helping to create scoring opportunities by running to different parts of the field, calling in tackles, and more. Individual plays, strategies, and formations can also be adjusted on the fly.</desc>

While you play, international soccer commentators John Motson, Des Lynam, and Andy Gray provide play-by-play and color commentary. All of the players on the field are realistic as well, thanks to new Motion Blending technology, a combination of motion capture technology and rendering tools that allows the players to look more natural and have fluid movements. Multi-colored goalie jerseys and numbers embossed on the back of the uniforms are only a couple of graphical touches that heighten the true to life nature of the game. All of the realism of FIFA '97 will have you reaching for your soccer cleats.</desc>

    <desc>Featuring more than fifteen different kinds of fish, twenty different fishing holes and lots of different lures, Fisherman's Bait 2: Big Ol' Bass is the PlayStation version of the popular Arcade game. Like the Little Max character from Mike Tyson's Punch Out, you are a transparent fisherman. You can go from "fishin' hole" to "fishin' hole" according to your preference. All of the spots are different in their variety of species. You also get to pick your own lure, ranging from poppers and worms to jerk bait. All lures produce different results, so choose wisely.

    <desc>The villainous Zaurer has usurped control of the floating lands and at his behest, vile creatures have overrun the seven worlds, terrorizing the inhabitants and generally running amok. As the bounty hunter Lay or the young priestess Cress, players must venture across the lands en route to a final showdown with the evil force behind the chaos. Floating Runner: Quest for the 7 Crystals is a 3D platform adventure consisting of fourteen levels across seven different themed environments, with classic locales ranging from tropical forests to frozen tundra. As in the Mega Man series of titles, players can choose which of the worlds to attempt in whatever order they so desire.

Populating each world are enemies in the guise of cute animals that can be dispatched using power-ups and weapons found scattered throughout the area. While avoiding the treacherous chasms and gaps that permeate the floating worlds, players will need to seek out special gems while keeping an eye on the time remaining to complete each world. Continues are unlimited so failure is little more than a temporary hindrance.</desc>

    <desc>After a violent interstellar resource war, mega-corporations seize power from the remnants of Earth's governments and lead humanity's way into the colonization of space. The last vestige of central authority is in the form of the G-Police (Government Police); an independent agency tasked with keeping order in the colonies. You play as rookie Jeff Slater - a former military pilot going undercover at the G-Police squadron on Callisto, in the hopes of finding the truth behind your sister's sudden death.

G-Police is an arcade-style helicopter shooter set inside the colony domes on Callisto. You pilot a futuristic close-air-support gunship, and are tasked with engaging ground and air enemies as you uncover a sinister corporate plot. Your ship can hover and turn in a VTOL mode, fire weapons outfitted before each mission, and lock on to objects in the world to both track enemies and scan suspicious cargo. Missions require you to navigate through the skyscrapers and billboards of the various city districts, and complete a number of objectives updated through radio contact with headquarters.</desc>

    <desc>Taking place only ten days after the events in the original G-Police, the sequel G-Police: Weapons of Justice centers around a group of small gangs in Callisto. The various gangs are taking advantage of the G-Police by exploiting their weakened and exhausted task force. With crime back on the rise, the city will have to pull through and pray for a miracle --- fortunately, they're prayers have been answered.

After an attempt to silence the terrorist organizations, your squad receives word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately, they're a few days away from the city and the G-Police can't keep things under control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival.

When the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city -- things are already too late. Those small gangs have turned into full-blown crime syndicates making the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the upper hand -- the G-Police uses a variety of five attack choppers including the Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines have supplied their Corsair cruise ship, Raptor, and Rhino --- a giant mechanized robot used for mass destruction and a heavily armed patrol vehicle, respectively.</desc>

    <desc>G-Darius revolves around a conflict between the humanoids of Amnelia and cyborg/chimera biovessels known as the "Thiima" (meant to mean simply "bringers of death"). The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots&amp;#x2014;Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen&amp;#x2014;are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.</desc>

    <desc>Galaga, the "slide-and-shoot" arcade classic from 1981, has been updated with nine new worlds, 3D graphics, futuristic backgrounds and more in GALAGA -- Destination: Earth.

It is late in the 22nd century, and the insect-like Galaga are back. Humans have terraformed and colonized most habitable places in our solar system, but the Galaga have only one thing in mind: destruction. The Galaga are mutated nanites that were inadvertently created during the terraforming process. They are deadly, autonomous and great in number, and you must blast them into oblivion. In addition to shooting Galaga, you must perform various mission objectives, such as collecting life pods and activating water turbines.

Like in the original game, you begin this enhanced version of Galaga controlling a ship that moves horizontally along the bottom of the playfield and fires upward at wave after wave of diving, swirling aliens that eventually fly into formation. However, unlike the original, this game, depending on what mission you are playing, features a number of other viewpoints, including over the shoulder, top down and side on. You can fire just two shots at a time, but you can gain the ability to have three shots onscreen at once.

Also like the original game, GALAGA -- Destination: Earth features challenge waves in which you blast streams of enemies for points while not having to worry about your own safety. And, of course, you can let a Galaga capture your ship, then shoot your ship's captor, letting the captured ship fall to you, enabling you to double your firepower. Similar to Gaplus, the sequel to classic Galaga, this game also lets you collect beam power-ups that enable you to capture enemies, place them by your side and use their weapons.</desc>

    <desc>A fleeting memory. A haunting vision. A childhood mystery that can prevent the destruction of mankind. Crave Entertainment, Inc. introduces Galerians, a survival-horror title for the PlayStation that thrusts players into a twisted future.

Rion is a young boy who awakens in a laboratory, unable to remember anything except his name. He soon discovers that he possesses psychic powers, although they come with severe consequences.

Players assume the role of Rion and must guide him through four locations in his search for Lilia and the secret of his past. Armed with powerful psychic abilities, Rion must combat human enemies and a variety of frightening genetic experiments. Unfortunately, nothing can prepare him for the confrontation with his own history.

The game spans three discs, combining action and puzzle solving in a horrific setting. Galerians utilizes a third-person perspective and features polygonal characters on pre-rendered backgrounds. The shocking truth is gradually revealed through fragmented visions and confessions, building to an epic struggle between man and machine.</desc>

    <name>Gauntlet Legends</name>
    <desc>For those unfamiliar with the original Gauntlet and its various home versions, the action involved fighting enemies such as ghosts, demons and sorcerers spawned from square structures called monster generators. An overhead perspective allowed players the freedom to explore the maze-like levels while still being able to see everything around them.

The object of each stage was simply to destroy the monsters in your path as you searched for the exit leading to the next level. Gauntlet Legends takes this simple formula and adds a new story, distinct worlds and even boss characters to fight. Of course, there are still treasure and potions waiting to be found as well as various traps that could spell disaster for even the heartiest of warriors.

In order to help you survive the later levels (Gauntlet Legends consists of over 30 stages), characters can earn experience points that will eventually translate into added strength, speed, armor and health. The story behind the game involves a jealous brother (Garm) of a noble wizard (Sumner) who decided to gather 13 Rune Stones in order to raise a demon.

Once the stones were placed on the floor of Sumner's tower, a hideous monster named Skorn was awakened and promptly consumed its new "master." As one of four intrepid adventurers, your goal is to travel through the worlds making up the Gauntlet Legends universe to defeat the evil demon Skorne and his various followers (a rather unsavory lot of Grunts, Ankle Biters, Suiciders, Bomb Throwers and Death).

To help you fight the good fight, you'll be able to find food, special weapons and power icons that can all be stored in your inventory and used whenever your character needs them. Some of the weapons include a three-way shot, fire breath and super shot, while the power-ups include super speed, invisibility and Anti-Death Power (which allows you to steal health from the normally invulnerable Death).</desc>

Environments are filled with power-ups, explosions, and destructive mayhem. Players wield an arsenal consisting of a devastating Vulcan cannon, electrically charged lightning attacks, and missiles capable of decimating ground tanks and flying squadrons. Power-ups include increases in speed, power, shields, bombs, and point bonuses, with the primary weapon changing depending on the last red (cannon), blue (lightning), or yellow (missile) disk picked up.

Gekioh: Shooting King features three main levels of difficulty: Geki Mode (normal fire rate), Easy Mode (enemies have half the rate of normal fire and collisions aren't always fatal), and Hard Mode (double firing rate and stacked odds). Six bonus modes are available from the beginning of the game (no unlocking required) and offer diversity in gameplay. Modes include Comical (damage accompanied by a laugh track), Stingy (one aircraft and one special weapon), No Mercy (unerring enemy fire), Slow (slow enemy fire but rate-multiplied), Ancient (bleached out color to eliminate power-up recognition), and Pocket (block-shaped symbols in basic form).</desc>

After saving the Television Realm from the evil Rez in his first adventure, the gecko was ready to kick back, relax, and watch a little television. Little did he know his adventure was just beginning.

One day, two secret agent goons showed up at Gex's doorstep. They inform him that Rez is back and looking for vengeance; the evil monster is planning to destroy the Television Realm once more...and possibly the world. When Gex tells them that he's retired and doesn't care, one of the goons hits the gecko on the head and takes him to a secluded place.

When Gex comes to, the mystery men plead with the gecko to take the cash and help destroy Rez for good...or at least make him disappear. With that incentive (the cash), the wise cracking lizard slips into his special agent suit and plunges headfirst into the Television Realm. Watch out, Rez -- Gex is back!</desc>

Taking place in the Crystal Kingdom, a well-natured wizard was mixing a new potion and got some rather explosive results. After a large eruption rocked the castle, his magical gloves flew from his hands and he was instantly turned to stone. As a result of the experiment gone awry, seven power crystals that hold the kingdom in balance were dispersed throughout the land.

Assuming the role of the animate glove, you'll go through exotic and complex worlds to locate the seven crystals that have taken on a rubber ball form. Glover's objective is to guide the crystals to safety by maneuvering them throughout the various worlds. It won't be easy however -- the Evil Glove is waiting in the wings to thwart the noble glove's attempt to bring peace and happiness back into the Crystal Kingdom.</desc>

    <desc>Gran Turismo is fundamentally based on the racing simulator genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses.

However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles.

Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They can be found in the North American version's code (and are unlockable via a GameShark cheat device). In addition to the hidden del Sols, there is also a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1998 Mazda Roadster exclusive to Arcade mode. The Corvette and Roadster can also be accessed via GameShark.</desc>

No matter what mode you play, all of your favorite baseball players are here thanks to an MLBPA license. An innovative power meter-based batting and pitching system puts you right in the middle of the action. Since the animation is motion captured, the players have smooth, fluid movements.

    <desc>In Grand Theft Auto, the player takes the role of a small-time criminal trying to make it big with the mob. Stealing cars, doing jobs for the gangsters and behaving generally anti-social are the way to success.

The action moves through six levels spread over three different cities, each based on a real US city: Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco) and Vice City (based on Miami). To finish a level, a certain score must be reached. Stealing cars and crashing into traffic, driving over pedestrians and killing cops all raise the score, but the big points are made through jobs. Answering phones or entering special cars brings mission assignments, from simple "ditch-a-hot-car" jobs to supporting bank robberies or carrying out assassinations. Completing a mission will raise the score substantially and also increase the score multiplier, so that completing the next felony will gain even more points.</desc>

    <desc>Grand Theft Auto: Mission Pack #1 - London 1969 is an official expansion pack to Grand Theft Auto. Instead of the fictional interpretations of New York, Miami and Los Angeles of the original, this game opens up the city of London to the player. The game features thirty new vehicles, new graphics and thirty-two new missions; all in a distinctly British theme. The new city contains many familiar landmarks from London in the late 60s as well as other cultural reference and Cockney slang. This time the player can choose the avatar's appearance, otherwise gameplay has not been changed from the original game. The player still is involved in organized crime and must perform a variety of criminal activities.</desc>

    <desc>The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions.

Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army.

New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</desc>

    <desc>Grid Runner is a futuristic version of "tag." On offense, your objective is to capture the flags around the levels without being tagged or killed. On defense, your main objective is to tag the other player (either the computer or a friend in two-player mode) before he or she collects all the flags.

In each level you will find different colored balls that will help you defeat your enemies. For example, the green balls increase your speed, red increases your magic, and blue increases your agility. The more power-ups you collect, the more efficient you become. You can also use and collect magic points.

Collecting magic points allows you to do one of six things: build a temporary bridge, drop explosives behind you, slow down your opponent, fire a weapon (which can be upgraded or traded), temporarily boost your speed, or teleport out of danger.</desc>

Those new creatures were called "gears". They had no will of their own and were destined to obey the humans forever. However, a gear named Justice was, for a mysterious reason, capable of disobeying the humans and making decisions of his own. He organized a rebellion of gears, that was later repressed by the knights of the Sacred Order, who put him in a prison. But recently, Justice broke free, and the Order organized a tournament to find out who is capable of hunting him down again. Among the main contestant is a man with unclear past, Sol Badguy, and his rival Ky Kiske, one of the most skilled knights of the order. The conditions of the tournament are, however, very strange. It is allowed to spill blood, and the first prize is also not very usual: any wish of the winner will be fulfilled...</desc>

Starting out with a few rudimentary implements and very little money, you begin the arduous task of reviving your grandfather's farm and thereby claiming your place as its rightful heir.

Players are given three years to achieve this goal. A year consists of four seasons, each of which lasts 30 days. Different crops can be planted each season, but before the seeds can be planted, the land must be cleared and then the soil tilled.

Seeds must also be watered until the fruit or vegetable matures. Once the crops are ready for harvest, they can be placed in a shipping bin where they'll be collected and paid for. In addition to farming, players will interact with local villagers and partake in seasonal events such as the Tomato Festival and Fireworks Display. As more money is earned, players can expand their farm and begin to raise livestock such as chickens and cows.</desc>

    <desc>Hello Kitty makes her way on to the PlayStation with Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy. The adorable kitty, whose popularity among little girls came in the form of plush toys, pencils, backpacks and other merchandise. As Hello Kitty, the popular Japanese character, you move her by making cubes disappear or piling them up in order to get her to collect prizes. After clearing a land, you get to choose where you want to go, changing the story.

The story begins when Hello Kitty falls asleep at a beach resort. When she wakes up she finds herself on a strange island surrounded by the smell of flowers. She realizes that her archenemy, Badtz-Maru has played a trick on her and she has been transported to another world. To get back home she has to make it through eleven different lands, each consisting of three stages.

There are three modes including: the Story mode; the Extra mode, which appears after you clear all the lands; and the Free Play mode, which allows you to play whatever levels you want either alone, with a partner or against a partner. The game also features a bonus round and cute illustrations of Hello Kitty.</desc>

    <name>Hi-Octane: The Track Fights Back!</name>
    <desc>Hi-Octane is a racing/vehicular combat video game released in 1995 for the PC, PlayStation and Sega Saturn, developed by Bullfrog, and based upon their earlier Magic Carpet game code.
It is notable amongst racing games for its wide and open tracks, and the resulting freedom offered to the player, and also for its excessive speed. It suffered in the marketplace due to thematic similarities with the better received Wipeout by Psygnosis and the generality of its graphics engine made for a very short depth of view compared to contemporary racing games.
Hi-Octane is rumored to begin life as something several Bullfrog programmers coded in free time, and then decided to improve the game and market it under the auspices of Electronic Arts. Developer Peter Molyneux stated[1] that EA set Bullfrog under pressure to release Dungeon Keeper, but they weren't able to do so within their deadlines. In order to relieve some of the pressure, they quickly developed Hi Octane.</desc>

On each turn, you control one pig for a set amount of time. You can move the animal and attack the enemy, and when time is up you switch to another soldier in the three- to five-member team. After all of your swine have moved, the enemies take their turn in a similar manner. For a real combat challenge, hook up the multi-tap and battle up to three friends in the multiplayer mode.

The game features well over a dozen different automobiles, though many of these must be "unlocked" by skillful play. Races take place across the country in such fair weather locations as Florida and California. In the words of the restaurant's own slogan, "Delightfully Tacky, Yet Unrefined."</desc>

    <desc>Utilizing a host of new gameplay elements, Hoshigami: Ruining Blue Earth expands upon the formula made popular by the cult classic Final Fantasy Tactics. The continent of Mardias serves as the game's primary world, and is divided into three kingdoms: Nightweld, the Valaimian Empire and Gerauld. The story begins as Valaimian troops advance into Nightweld, a peace-loving kingdom. Lacking the military might to repel the invaders from multiple fronts, Fazz - a mercenary and the game's protagonist - is hired to defend the Tower of Wind. Needless to say, this is just the beginning of a dire and perilous journey for the unwitting Fazz.

As you and your party trek across the world map, you'll take part in various battles. Ready-for-Action Points (RAP) determine which, as well as the number of actions that can be performed by a particular character. The more actions performed (and thus, more RAPs expended) during a turn, the longer you'll have to wait for your next chance to act. When attacking, an interactive gauge appears that does damage based upon where the slider is stopped. Stopping it at the very end will result in greater damage dealt to the enemy. Wait too long however and the slider will return to the beginning.</desc>

There are no championships to race for or time trials to beat. Simply choose your track, select a boat, and head out to the water.

While no special modes of play exist, there are tracks and boats to be unlocked. Hydro Thunder allows players access to three boats and three tracks at the start of the game. New boats will be released depending on your finish on each of the three tracks. A player must finish in one of the top three positions on each track for new boats to become available. Boats each have their own advantages in areas such as control, stability, and speed.

Tracks are released in the same way as boats. A top three finish in each of the first three available tracks is needed in order to unlock new tracks. On the new tracks a top two finish will be required and so on. No difficulty settings are featured in Hydro Thunder but when new tracks are released they will contain an increased difficulty level. The first three tracks are considered easy, the next three medium, and the three after that hard.</desc>

The story unwinds in an unusual manner: At the start of the game, your character, Agent John Cord, has been captured by the enemy and is in the midst of a grueling interrogation. The scenes from the game come from his memories as he is undergoing this ordeal, with players taking on his previous adventures that lead him up to this point. It is a spy-thriller in the vein of James Bond, and as Cord remembers more, the overall story begins to make more sense.

Throughout In Cold Blood, players will have to search for hidden objects and talk to a whole host of characters, attempting at every turn to solve the puzzles that pop up in their way. But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in high-octane gun battles against enemy agents. Occasionally, the player can outwit the enemies, but they'll often they'll have to fight it out in a duel to the death.</desc>

But tricky conundrums aren't the only thing blocking their paths -- they'll also have to take control of Agent Cord in high-octane gun battles against enemy agents. Occasionally, the player can outwit the enemies, but they'll often they'll have to fight it out in a duel to the death.</desc>

    <desc>The Dark Anarchy Society is taking over the world, destroying Earth's biggest cities in the process. As captain of an attack sub, you must seek and destroy the D.A.S.'s underwater headquarters which lie somewhere in the frigid depths of the Antarctic Circle. Your ship is equipped with machine guns and torpedoes. These weapons can be upgraded to surface-to-air missiles, smart missiles, floating mine launchers, hyper torpedoes, and supersonic torpedoes.

While you cruise beneath the surface of the ocean, helicopters, walkers, submarines, and other vehicles of destruction release a torrent of bombs, torpedoes, and missiles, constantly assailing your ship from all sides. You've also got to watch out for ice beams that freeze all vessels within range.

This side-scrolling shooter is composed of seven levels: The South Pole, The Channel, Seabed Ruins, Sunken Town, Deep Dark Sea, and the Enemy Base. A friend can join in for two-player simultaneous action.</desc>

    <desc>Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Crazy Maze isn't the type of game one would expect when taking on the role of the bumbling, multi-functional detective of the 1980's cartoon. Rather than an action title like its Game Boy Color counterpart, this incarnation of Inspector Gadget is best described as a puzzle game with limited action elements.

According to the story of Gadget's Crazy Maze, Inspector Gadget's mysterious arch-nemesis is up to no good once again. This time, the MADD ringleader Dr. Claw has been creating mind-control crystals on his secret moon base, then tossing them down to Earth. If the crystals lay dormant for a short amount of time, they will activate, taking control of the consciousness of the whole world. To make sure no one disturbs them, Dr. Claw has spread them all around four different areas and inserted his vile henchmen to protect them.</desc>

The events take place in the USA, Russia, Germany, China, Cuba, Korea, France, Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Japan, and Kenya.

    <desc>Inuyasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale is a 2D fighting game starring characters from Rumiko Takahashi's manga and anim&amp;#xE9; series, Inuyasha. The story centers around 15-year old high school student Kagome Higure, who inadvertently slips back in time to feudal Japan, where she becomes embroiled in a quest to locate shards of the Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls. "Feudal Fairy Tale," the game's main mode of play, follows this escapade and requires players to engage in a series of battles and mini-games in order to obtain the coveted shards. Initially, only Kagome and her half-demon companion Inuyasha are playable, but as players journey through the game, acquiring shards, more characters become available.

Each character is able to perform both strong and weak attacks, as well as throws and counter attacks. Players can also execute more powerful combination maneuvers, including special and super attacks, which can only be initiated when the Spiritual meter is filled. Additionally, specific attacks can cause opponents to drop shards that, once claimed, will fill the Spiritual meter more quickly.</desc>

    <desc>The story for Invasion From Beyond is based on the golden age of B-Movie science fiction thrillers, and goes like this: farm workers have been abducted and crop circles were discovered in farmlands outside Washington, D.C.. The locals' insults towards superstitious fears ("Slap an Alien") were a welcome party for the Martians ready to strike. You are a fully qualified Earthlink and must pilot your ship to stop the alien invasion by manipulating the ground-based firepower of Earthlink Command and prevent the aliens from taking over our beloved planet Earth.

The game features more than 30 missions of futuristic action with many secret levels, ships and weapons. Your prime directive is to kill all invading alien forces. However, whenever Earthlink Command wants you to complete a specific objective, you will be notified via a flashing communications icon.

Your ship features a radar, cargo hold, weapon mounts, aiming reticule and the Suck-O-Matic. The Suck-O-Matic is an experimental device used to teleport and blow items in and out of your ship's cargo hold. It is an essential part for much of the game's objectives.</desc>

    <desc>Irritating Stick, published by Jaleco and developed by the guys and gals at Saurus is quite a weird idea when it comes to what the videogame industry has expected in the past. Based on a cult TV show in Japan where contestants have to guide a rod in between two barriers of pulsating volts of electricity to the end of the maze without touching either side as this will lead to a shock of electricity, you would hardly even conceive this idea to be a practical videogame.

The game entails moving around what appears to be a dot on the screen since this actually represents the stick in a 3D world that is viewed from "top down" on the head of the rod. By directing this rod through the maze without hitting either of the barriers, you will take victory. However speed also must be taken into consideration since a time limit is established for each course. Players can also change speeds by simply pressing the X button to drop down a speed or circle to speed up with a total of five speeds available. The unlimited number of mazes are set through various background courses and obstacles from spinning blades, poker machines and even a metal robot.</desc>

The Time Trial is simply a race against a "ghost" image of best performance, and the Single Race allows you to learn the course designs and practice controls.</desc>

    <desc>Jersey Devil, as the title implies, is loosely based upon the legendary New Jersey beast of the same name. Instead of the horrific beast the legend describes, the protagonist of the title is cute purple creature with long-ears and small wings. Dr. Knarf -- the villain of the piece -- has created a legion of mutated vegetables to do his evil bidding, and it falls to Jersey Devil to stop the maniacal scientist.

To do this, the purple protagonist must venture through a series of 3D platform stages spread across themed environments such as a museum, cemetery, forest, and even a haunted house. Endowed with an ample set of abilities, Jersey Devil must jump, glide, and tail whip his way through the hordes of vegetables and undead minions, the latter comprising such mainstays as zombies, bats, and spiders.</desc>

The game has a its variant of the traditional road course, but also introduces a new course type, known as a suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course, and the starting grid in the center. Characters race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete.

    <desc>A digital re-creation of the hobby of puzzle building, Jigsaw Madness offers gamers a collection of 150 different puzzles (across a variety of themes) that can be pieced together, alone or against up to three other players. Utilizing a small hand-shaped cursor, players construct puzzles that range in size from 24 to 96 to 150 pieces, each depicting anything from animals and insects to sports and anim&amp;#xE9; characters. Players are given only seven pieces at a time with which to work, and basic statistics such as the number of pieces placed both, correctly and incorrectly, as well as the time elapsed is continually displayed.

The multiplayer portion of the title allows up to four players to compete against one another, in a race to see who can complete the puzzle fastest. A handful of options are available, including whether or not an outline of the various shapes is displayed on the playing field, thereby making the game easier.</desc>

Players will be able to take control of Jotaro Kujo, his friends, and his enemies in this world hopping, globe spanning fighting fest. Now PlayStation gamers will be able to take a Stand and wallop their friends over the head with them in the comfort of their own home.

This game offers much of the two dimensional fighting fare that Capcom is renowned for. It takes a side venture into new realms with the addition of your Stand partners however. When you whip out a special attack or some hits, a phantasmal apparition will appear to give you back up. Each one differs depending on the characters alignment along the Tarot spectrum, and players also have the ability to put their Stand into a more active role once they build up their Stand Gauge. Then your alter egos can weigh in and have the ability to set up painful chain combos and they enable special character abilities like double jumping and air attacks.</desc>

After completing the daunting task that is Story mode, players will have an even better time competing in the game's primary Ranking mode. Here they must fight anywhere between three and 12 fighters to win the title belt and gain valuable experience points. After winning a title, they can then defend their title to gain more points or open up new championship tournaments. While there are no rewarding endings or additional special characters to be earned, Ranking Mode is enjoyable enough to bring players back again and again.</desc>

Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. He can also shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will, but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate.</desc>

Each character has a different skill that he or she can utilize to beat their level. For instance, one LEGO hero can use their jetpack to jump greater distances, while another takes no damage from the radioactive water that permeates the underground passageways. In addition to these unique skills, each of your characters can drill into certain rock formations, destroying them and allowing you to pass.

    <desc>Plug in a light gun and dispense justice in LETHAL ENFORCERS I &amp; II. In LETHAL ENFORCERS I, you must put a stop to an evil plot involving organized crime. You&amp;#x2019;ll blast mafia hit men and explore a modern urban landscape, which includes docks and a Chinatown district.

In LETHAL ENFORCERS II, you&amp;#x2019;re thrust into the Old West and must take on stagecoach thieves and cattle rustlers. Both games feature digitized graphics that make all of the bad guys look as real as possible. If you don&amp;#x2019;t happen to own a light gun, the standard controller is also supported. If you are looking for old-school shooting action, you should try LETHAL ENFORCERS I &amp; II.</desc>

After finishing the level you have a chance to buy an extra life with the money collected. Shooting isn't ordinary, often Lucky needs to ricochet shots to hit his target.

The levels differ from town exploring, to bottle-shooting in a bar, to freeing hostages on the roof of train, to Indian sneaking. But, all of them lead Lucky to $1,000,000 for the capture of the Daltons.</desc>

Besides offering 31 NFL teams (including the Cleveland Browns), authentic players with ratings based on the 1998 season and 31 official stadiums, the fourth game in the PlayStation series expands the coaching features to go along with 1998's Season, Franchise, Tournament, Practice and Exhibition play modes. 

This means you'll be able to create your own plays from scratch, test them out in the Practice mode and add them to your favorite NFL team. In addition, you can create your own camera angles, rearrange each team's depth charts and select twelve audibles (six on offense and six on defense) in order to change plays at the line of scrimmage.</desc>

    <desc>Madden NFL 97 is the first Madden NFL football game to be created in the 32-bit gaming era. It was originally created for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, but other versions were also released, including the 16 bit Super NES and Genesis.

This was the first edition of Madden to implement the use of a salary cap when customizing team rosters. It also featured the new Baltimore Ravens, the expansion franchise that absorbed the roster of the Cleveland Browns for the 1996 season. The game also adds a team of real free agents (as opposed to the blank slate used in Madden 96) which can be traded and added to other teams' rosters (led by recently semi-retired quarterback Randall Cunningham), and could be played by using a cheat code.

Classic teams were once again used, although most were different from the previous year's teams; the years ranged as far back as 1952 (Detroit Lions) and as recent as 1990 (Buffalo Bills). Jacksonville and Carolina, once again, did not get classic teams, but Baltimore was attached to a classic Cleveland Browns team.</desc>

    <name>Magic Carpet</name>
    <desc>First released on PC way back in 1994, and then remade for the original PlayStation, Magic Carpet is in essence a free-movement FPS. Taking on the role of a magician on a magic carpet, you&amp;#x2019;ll run through around 50 levels, killing stuff with magic and then collecting its &amp;#x201C;mana.&amp;#x201D; Collect enough mana and the next level is opened up. 

The stuff being killed is not defenceless though &amp;#x2013; far from it. Enemies range from relatively harmless vultures, right through to swarms of undead, firespitting dragons and titanic wyverns. There&amp;#x2019;s also other mages to contend with &amp;#x2013; in some levels as many as seven - and that&amp;#x2019;s where the toughest challenges are at.

Each mage possesses a castle. As long as the castle exists, the mage has a spawning point should he/ she die. The castle is upgradable provided the mage has collected enough mana, so levels quickly fall into a rhythm that is split evenly between fighting the wildlife to collect mana, protecting your own castle, and then attacking your &amp;#x201C;human&amp;#x201D; opponents.

So far it probably all sounds pretty standard, but Magic Carpet has a host of ideas that work so well, the game still remains relevant today. The maps are reasonably small (by today&amp;#x2019;s standards), but they really are open &amp;#x2013; each map is filled with secrets and dangers to find and avoid. The levels are also morphable &amp;#x2013; it is possible to destroy environments as it was possible to create volcanoes and gaping chasms.

There is also a huge range of spells to collect and use &amp;#x2013; 24 in total &amp;#x2013; ranging from standard shield and health regeneration, through to more aggressive fireballs and the awesome destructive might of meteors.</desc>

    <desc>Martian Gothic : Unification is one of the numerous titles which came out at the end of the PlayStation lifespan. At first glance, it looks like a typical Resident Evil rip-off with a futuristic paint, a disturbing cover and bad voice-acting. Of course, the game ended up selling very poorly. But it's so much more than that. Incidentally, it is also Creative Reality's last game. Sharing the same team and the same writer than Dreamweb, it comes as no surprise that the game heavily relies on writing and puzzles. This reliance (and a few more things) makes Martian Gothic: Unification a title to look back at.</desc>

Because the world is being invaded by aliens, it is up to you and your sidekick Bones to stop the invasion and single handedly save Earth. In order to do so, you must make good use of your special suit, which allows you to do all kinds of things.

The super-suit comes equipped with many features you'll need to utilize in your journey, such as the sniper helmet. This allows you to zoom in on unsuspecting enemies and fire off shots with pinpoint accuracy. There is also a built in parachute (a ribbon-like device) that enables you to glide between different platforms as well as drop down on intruders.

Your suit comes equipped with a chain gun that has an infinite supply of ammunition. You can also pick up special items, like a miniature nuclear bomb and powerful upgrades for your chaingun. In addition to running around and shooting, there are also special means of transportation including a surfboard-like jet and a bomber plane that is used to call in air strikes.</desc>

    <desc>You are the genetically engineered Clan Mechwarrior. The Clans are invading the Inner Sphere. Join either the Wolf Clan or the Jade Falcon Clan as they pursue their own agenda against the Inner Sphere and other Clans. Take your advanced Omnimechs into battle against all comers. Win high warrior ratings (by using less mechs or smaller mechs than needed, completing secondary objectives, etc.) and you'll get chance at a promotion trial where you face superior odds in an arena. If you win, you advance in rank. If you are very successfully, you can make it all the way up to Khan, leader of the Clan!

Mechwarrior II was developed in-house by Activision as the successor to their original Mechwarrior. While this time there are no dynamic campaign and mercenary actions, the Clan culture is integrated into the two campaigns. Different clans have different mechs and different rules, even different weapons. You can customize your mechs in order to use less than the "par" force in order to get a higher rating. The full 3D environment wasn't pretty as this was before the 3D accelerators made their debut, but it's still better than anything that came before. Let addition of NetMech allowed users to fight each other online. When 3D cards came along, special versions were created to take advantage of 3D texturing. While not QUITE as replayable as Mechwarrior, it's nonetheless a classic.</desc>

The legend has it that Fortesque lead the King's army into battle against Zarok's demonic hordes and that Sir Daniel himself killed the sorcerer during the battle - despite having actually been mortally wounded at the outset - cementing his posthumous status as the "Hero of Gallowmere".</desc>

He learns that Zarok's spell book has unfortunately been found by another sorcerer named Lord Palethorn. Upon opening the book, Palethorn managed to scatter all of the pages across London, turn himself into an elf with red skin (a side effect from the book losing all of its content) and unleashed the living dead amongst the city. So, it's up to Sir Dan and his new allies, a professor with metal hands and a mummy princess named Kiya to stop Palethorn from collecting all the lost pages of the spell book to take over all of London.</desc>

    <desc>A semi-sequel/prequel to the highly acclaimed Metal Gear Solid (MGS), Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions puts you once again in control of the top-level FoxHound field specialist, Solid Snake. This time around, instead of fighting genetically engineered soldiers and saving the world from Metal Gear, you're in a combat simulator. Aboard the Discovery (the submarine that Solid Snake traveled upon before reaching Angel Island), you will prepare for the dangers ahead.

For those that have yet to experience MGS, the gameplay is based around strategy, tactics and action. Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions's interface and concept is similar to its predecessor, but is based on the simulator game mode that was included in MGS. This time, instead of just a few missions, you have nearly 150 different stages to play (300 including the Time Attack modes). Fans of MGS should be able to quickly pick up on the gameplay style. In fact, not only is the gameplay recognizable by fans of the original Metal Gear Solid, each of the missions (although similarities are sometimes minute) are based on events that occurred in MGS.</desc>

    <desc>Sony's MLB series consistently pitches terrific baseball action onto the PlayStation, and MLB 2001 is the best offering yet in the series. Fortunately for gamers, it appears that Sony spent less time tweaking this game's graphics and more time focusing on more important issues like gameplay and accuracy.
The game opens with an impressive full-motion video highlight reel before presenting gamers with the opening menus. Here you can jump directly into an exhibition game, kick off a season, kill time with the home run derby, or select one of several other options. Of particular note is the franchise mode, which lets you start with a fictional team and build it into a World Series-winning franchise.
Graphically, stadiums are rendered about as accurately as the aging PlayStation hardware allows, and players are smoothly animated. The audio also is done well--you can tell by the sound of the bat if you've hit a mere pop fly or pounded a homer, and the commentary by Vin Scully and Dave Campbell stays fresh even after several games.</desc>

The breeder must take it in hand to raise the monster throughout its life, training it, keeping it healthy, making an exercise schedule, and trying to maximize its abilities before it dies of old age or is retired. Monsters have good or bad morale depending on how they are raised; loyal monsters are more likely to perform critical hits, while disloyal monsters might refuse to obey commands or not fight at all. Retired monsters can be combined to create more powerful monsters.</desc>

You then take your monster into the arena where it battles with other monsters for cash prizes, prestige, and better stats. Like the original Monster Rancher, this game allows players to create a monster using an innovative technique: you can stick in any CD you own (PlayStation, audio, PC, or other) and the data that is read off the CD is used to generate the characteristics of the monster.</desc>

    <desc>Monster Rancher Hop-A-Bout is a PlayStation-game released in 2000. It is a spin-off of the popular Monster Rancher franchise. In the game players control one of the titular monsters in a series of levels where the objective is to reach a goal on the other side of the level. Between the player and the goal are several tiles which can have different effects on the player character as they jump on them.

All levels have a time limit, and the game scores players depending on the tiles they've jumped on and the time they take to reach the goal. The player character has three lives, if the player should fall off the level, they will lose one life. The gameplay is controlled entirely with the D-pad, and the player character is always jumping.</desc>

Of course, it does do a few things differently. One major difference is the fantasy setting. No ranches or medical settings here, no sir. Another key difference is in the overall presentation; Monster Seed's gameplay and interface are a lot more simple than most other breeding games.

Similar to mother games in the genre, there's a brief tutorial of sorts, and then you're off to gather your own creatures, earning better seeds and other breeding components as you go. Just be careful with your critters, because if they die in battle, they're gone for good. Granted you can always breed more, but it can certainly set you back if your creature hatches at level five, but you lost a level twelve.</desc>

    <desc>There are music-mixing computer programs that cost thousands of dollars, but none of them are this fun. You chose your rhythm tracks, bass lines, guitar riffs, and triangle hits in this complete music-making experience. You can make rock, pop, hip-hop, techno, or jazz songs, and each will be vastly different from the others. There are more than 1,500 riffs and 3,000 instrument sounds to choose from, and you can even write your own parts instead of using the pre-programmed melodies. Just about everything you can think of can be manipulated here, right down to the volume of the floor toms, the amount of reverb applied to each instrument, and the song's tempo. The next step is to create a music video for your masterpiece, and you'll have plenty of 3D clips at your disposal in so doing. Once you have your complete package, you can save everything to a memory card and access any part of it (from an instrument sound or keyboard riff to the entire song) later. All in all, it's about the most creative use of a video game console imaginable.</desc>

    <desc>MTV SPORTS: Pure Ride lets you snowboard without having to drive up a mountain or get cold. When you want to play, there are nine riders (including four professionals) and 14 boards to choose from. If you need to learn the controls, you can use the Stunt mode and try to copy the moves of the trainer. Should you need even more training and practice, you can use the Specialist mode and try to master one of the three events in the game. Perform well, and you will unlock new courses. Once you have the controls down, the ultimate test lies in the Tour Challenge mode where you will have to compete in slopestyle, halfpipe, and big air events. To move on to a more challenging circuit, you must place first in all of the events. See what kind of stunts you can perform in MTV SPORTS PURE RIDE.</desc>

Forgoing the character interaction and inventory-based puzzles found in earlier computer adventure games, Myst places you in a lonely, desolate environment with no obvious indication on where you should go or what you are supposed to do. By exploring the island, you will eventually stumble upon an assortment of puzzles in the form of intricate contraptions, whose secrets can only be unlocked after discovering evidence of their nature. As you progress in the game, you will find four other books written by Atrus that magically transport you to additional worlds, each offering more interconnected puzzles and clues to the storyline. Myst's look is noteworthy for featuring still images viewed from a first-person perspective, with interaction limited to manipulating a cursor over each static picture.</desc>

The game is divided into a Trainer class and three Fighter classes, and each class advancement results in an improvement in vehicle performance. Weapons are also made available, although not until you've cleared the Trainer class. Once you've passed your training, you've got to get your permits, which let you compete in races with big pay offs. After getting the necessary permits, you can compete in tournaments, earn some cash, and buy new planes. There are also Time Trials and Special Events, which help to keep things fresh and interesting. You'll also discover a huge roster of available aircraft, so you never know when you've actually seen all of them. Even though the Career mode is where you'll spend the majority of your time, NGEN RACING's intense Arcade mode will also keep you engrossed in the game. For intense multiplayer action, you can also take on a friend and find out who is the best fighter jockey.</desc>

    <desc>NASCAR Thunder 2002 is a racing simulator video game developed by EA Tiburon and published by EA Sports that came out for the Sony PlayStation, Sony PlayStation 2, and Xbox. The theme song for the game is "Sweet Home Alabama" by Lynyrd Skynyrd. It is the fifth game in the NASCAR series of video games, and is the first of the series to have a new title (the other games simply read "NASCAR", followed by the year). Notably, it is the first NASCAR game to feature alternate paint schemes on the cars. It featured the 2001 Cup Series Champion Jeff Gordon on its cover and 2000 Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte on the disc. (From Wikipedia)</desc>

    <desc>You can race on a variety of courses, from twenty three real world Winston Cup courses, twelve road courses and eleven fantasy courses, including a costal town and a busy city. There are sixty challenges in all.

When racing, what you do on the circuit affects future races. Ram someone into the wall or cause someone to spin out, and they'll remember. They'll try to get back at you in a future race. Help someone out, by clearing a path or sharing the draft, and they'll return the favor to you. Grudges and alliances are tracked throughout your career, so the more you piss someone off, the more likely they'll try to harm you.

Like the Football Camp mode in Madden NFL 2004, the Speed Zone is comprised of different many games that will earn you points and increase your skill, such as passing and drafting, blocking and drifting.

With the Career mode, you can go through a full twenty seasons before having to retire. You manage everything, from your pit crew and car parts to your sponsors and research and development.

There are seventy officially licensed drivers and over 180 vehicle skins. If nothing suits you, create your own driver and car and see how you do.

As in every 2004 edition of EA Sports console games, you'll find the EA Sports Bio, which is a career tracker that tracks your stats over every EA Sports game. The more games you play and the longer you play, the higher your level and the more rewards you can unlock.

Tune your car right and drive like a pro, and you may just make it to the finish line.</desc>

Hangtime was the third basketball game by the original development team behind the NBA Jam series. The title was changed due to the NBA Jam name being acquired by Acclaim Entertainment, the publisher of the games for the home market. Acclaim's NBA Jam Extreme was released the same year as Hangtime. Features introduced in Hangtime included character creation, alley oops and double dunks. A software update known as NBA Maximum Hangtime was released for the arcades later in the life cycle.

The ending of Maximum Hangtime promises a new, 3-D basketball title from Midway, which was eventually released as NBA Showtime: NBA on NBC.</desc>

In the original game, the emphasis was on an arcade look and feel. NBA IN THE ZONE '98 advances the series' evolution by leaning towards more of a basketball simulation. New options include an on-the-fly play-calling system as well as statistical tracking, which not only keeps season stats but also charts league leaders in various categories. You can also take on a friend in Versus mode and see who is really in the zone; with two multitaps, up to eight people can play at one time.</desc>

While all of the standard gameplay modes like Exhibition, Season, and Playoffs are included, two modes have been added: Slam Dunk Challenge and Three-Point Shootout. In the Slam Dunk Challenge, you choose the difficulty of your dunk and must memorize a series of button presses. The score for the dunk is determined by how well you recreate the button sequence. The Three-Point Shootout calls for you to stop a power bar in one of three locations to get the ball to go through the hoop. You have 60 seconds to shoot 25 balls, so you've got to be efficient if you want to win. No matter how you like your hoops action, you're sure to find what you want with NBA IN THE ZONE '99.</desc>

There are, however, only five players from each team on the court at one time, similar to NBA Jam. The game also supports an advanced A.I. and is rendered in 3-D polygons. There are two modes to choose from, Exhibition and Playoff.</desc>

Starting from NBA Live 2000, the series featured NBA Live Legend All-Stars Teams, that included some biggest names from five decades (50s to 90s). These teams could be used instantly, but to use the players as regular players (e.g. traded, played on regular NBA Teams) they needed to be unlocked. Along the series, some of the rosters were changed due to many reasons as Michael Jordan was on the 90's team through 2004.</desc>

    <desc>If you love basketball (and you know you do), get ready for best thing since sliced bread. NBA SHOOTOUT 2002 takes the popular SHOOTOUT franchise to new heights, featuring the most realistic-looking action to date. The player models are created from a combination of photographs, motion-capture animation, and texture mapping which means the superstars and benchwarmers alike will appear just as they do in real-life. An updated game engine gives the play the feel of the NBA, and all of the new rules changes are in effect, too. The courts look like their real-life counterparts, with updates included for new floors like Seattle's. You choose your team, execute any desired trades, set your starting lineup, and pick through the playbook to create the most dominant squad in the league. High-flying dunks, touch shooting, and a sophisticated foul system make the NBA SHOOTOUT 2002 even more incredible than the beloved series installments that paved the way.</desc>

    <name>NBA ShootOut 2003</name>
    <desc>NBA ShootOut (Total NBA in the United Kingdom) is a series of basketball video games based on the NBA and released for the PlayStation and PlayStation 2. The first two entries were released in 1996 and 1997. Later entries were developed by 989 Sports, including NBA ShootOut 2000, the only game in the series to be released for Microsoft Windows.

In the games, players can choose an existing NBA franchise and play exhibition or regular season games, as well as create their own players to include in regular season team rosters. Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal were not represented in the game. In early 2000s versions, Michael Jordan is included as a member of the Washington Wizards. Earlier versions of the game made it extremely difficult for players to slam dunk, a problem that was rectified in later games.</desc>

    <desc>NBA Shootout 2004 lets you play either a full season or exhibition matches of fully licensed NBA basketball with your favorite teams and players. Fully textured 3d players with faces of the top NBA players are mapped into the game. Listen to commentary by Ian Eagle and Bill Walton as they call the games right as you play.

While there is no franchise mode like other more traditional sports games, there is a career mode where you create a character who tries to make his way up through the summer leagues and the NBDL. You'll be given challenges that you'll need to meet so that you can ultimately make your way to the NBA and get an actual contract to join a NBA team. Once in the NBA, you'll need to work even harder to win championships and titles so you can eventually be inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame.

You can also unlock the 50 greatest players of all time by completing challenges in exhibition games like scoring a certain number of points or using a certain person to get a number of assists.

Use a USB microphone to give your teammates commands to help. Give them commands on offense or defense about where to move so you can use your teammates effectively.</desc>

    <name>Need For Speed: High Stakes</name>
    <desc>Just like its predecessors Need for Speed: High Stakes is an action racing game with a wide selection of exotic sports cars and many different types of tracks. The trademark Hot Pursuit mode game mode from the first game in the series is still present, where players race opponents on tracks filled with regular traffic and police cars that chase the racers. The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested. There are minor differences between the two platforms for this game mode, regarding spike strips, road blocks, and back-up. The latter for instance is unique to the PlayStation version. The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.

It is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.

In addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models. Damage now affects both the appearance and the performance of the car for the first time.</desc>

Much like the first in the series, the sequel has plenty of high performance cars to choose from, including the McLaren F1 or Ferrari F50 and a few concept cars, each handling differently.

Once you've beaten the six tracks, a new track is available to you. It's a fast paced racing game which is intended to play more like an arcade racer than a true simulation.

The main difference between this and the previous Need for Speed game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase you. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while you race.</desc>

Using an amazingly intuitive controller configuration, BLITZ keeps it as simple as possible. It's all about excitement, as you choose between 27 effective offensive plays and nine defensive sets for your NFL franchise. The teams are all here, but reality has flown out the window, as you rip off helmets, throw punches, and dive at kickers. New features include individual stats based on NFL performance, new player animations, updated stadiums, multiplayer options in Season mode, better AI, new rants from the BLITZ announcer, and a cool new soundtrack. The highlight of the additions, however, has to be the Party Games mode, which allows up to four players to compete in crazy football challenges. In "1st and Goal Frenzy," you have four downs to score on your opponent; "Goal Line Stand" reverses the scenario and has you defending for four downs; and "Quarterback Challenge" has you passing at specific targets. Oh, and there's one more thing new cheerleaders.</desc>

    <name>NFL Quarterback Club 97</name>
    <desc>It must be frustrating for a game company to produce a sports title and know it's inferior to those produced by EA Sports. Case in point: Acclaim's new NFL Quarterback Club 97 for the Playstation. Compared to EA's brilliant Madden NFL '97, NFL Quarterback Club 97 is simply second-rate. Though NFL Quarterback Club 97 does have some merits, there's not enough here to make it worth its hefty price.

NFL QB Club utilizes many of the same gameplay elements seen in Madden '97 - including the kicking T-meter, the three-quarter overhead primary camera angle, and the button assignments and controls. Player animations are fluid and realistic (the tackles are some of the best going), and the large - though a tad cartoony - player sprites have clearly visible jersey numbers and names. However, the players never seem to move quickly enough: For example, the great Emmitt Smith lumbers downfield as though he's running in sand. Inclement weather options, like snow and rain, look ridiculous. Moreover, penalties are highly unrealistic, with defensive and offensive pass interference called at least once during every set of downs (while almost nothing else is called throughout the entire game). And how could there be no coin toss to determine who kicks and who receives? Sheesh.

To be fair, NFL QB Club 97 boasts a singularly impressive feature: a historic simulation mode. Players can choose among 50 different classic NFL game situations and try to rewrite history. Imagine...it's December 23, 1973. The Dallas Cowboys are down 28-13 to the 49ers. With under a minute remaining, the Boys score a TD and recover an onside kick. Can you complete one of the greatest comebacks in NFL history? It's this type of do-or-die drama that the game's historic sim mode provides. And if that's not enough, there's a custom simulation mode, which allows gamers to create and save up to five game situations, right down to the exact game circumstances (weather, time remaining, score, etc.).

While this game has some admirable qualities, in the end it falls short of the high standards set by Madden '97. Unless you harbor a deep hatred for John Madden and his know-it-all wisecracks, leave NFL Quarterback Club 97 on the shelves.</desc>

    <desc>NFL Xtreme is a licensed NFL game with 30 official teams and stadiums. Loosely simulating American football, games are played on a five-on-five format and an arcade approach is taken, with complete disregard for the official rules. Quarterbacks can easily throw 90-yard passes, defenders have hard-hitting tackling moves, and attackers can use spin or turbo to evade opponents, or flip over them. Late hits and pass interference are no problem, and you can even taunt and trash talk. To promote aggressiveness, opponents, when properly injured, can be out for an entire season.

The game modes includes exhibition matches, a regular season and play-offs. There are detailed statistics, and you can sign, release or even create new players to build your team. Highlights can be reviewed in the instant replay mode, and you can alter the weather type, difficulty level and player size in the options.</desc>

NHL 2000 has everything you would possibly desire from a hockey game.</desc>

    <desc>In NHL 2001, there are five primary game modes: exhibition, season (where players can take a team through a full season and act as the team's general manager), tournament (involving up to 16 teams), playoffs (also a 16 team format), and shootout (where gamers play out the tie breaker format used in international hockey). Outside of the season and playoff modes, NHL 2001 allows gamers to use a total of 18 international teams and four all-star teams.

Several new features have been added to the mix including "Big Hit" and "Big Shot" buttons for enhanced gameplay. Also new to gameplay is "The Momentum Meter," where a team's performance is affected by the game's momentum. Finally, similar to the Madden Challenge offered in EA's football title, NHL 2001 offers NHL Challenge Mode. Here, players are rewarded points for achieving certain tasks during gameplay. These points can then be used to enhance the abilities of created players.</desc>

    <desc>NHL 98 features much faster and refined gameplay (now using four action keys instead of two, removing the need to double-tap to perform some actions), along other new features such as "in-the-fly" tactics developed by Marc Crawford, then manager of the Colorado Avalanche and new commentary lines from Jim Hughson and Darryl Reaugh and a re-worked interface.
Graphics are improved from the previous version with the players being less angular, and thanks to 3Dfx support, with less pixels showing in the textures. The in-game presentation follows a TV-style script, zooming in players while displaying stats during clock stoppages.

As far as game modes go, in the year of the first Olympic Tournament with professional players, NHL 98 introduced the first real international competition, with 18 International teams to choose from. Other game modes include Season (option to pick between 25 or 82 games) and Playoff (best of 1, 3, 5 or 7 matches) and a Penalty Shootout mode.</desc>

    <desc>Based on the 1988 NES game, BLADES OF STEEL, this update delivers detailed hockey physics combined with brilliant, arcade-style animation. You can play any way you'd like, as there are five difficulty levels, five game speeds, adjustable controls, and plenty of other options. Not only does BLADES OF STEEL 2000 include all NHL players and teams, it also has the most complete set of fighting options you'll find this side of a boxing game: you have the choice of several different punch types, and it's even possible to land body shots and tackle your opponent. You can play an entire season, a single game, or jump right into the Stanley Cup Playoffs as you slash and check your way to hard-fought victory. As a GM, you can trade, sign, drop, or create your own players, and the rosters are very easy to manage. Each NHL athlete is graded based on skating, shooting, stick handling, spirit, fighting, and stamina so you know these guys are going to be realistic. Randy Hahn, the voice of the San Jose Sharks, provides in-depth commentary, and the PA announcer sounds uncannily authentic. If realistic hockey and smooth play are your idea of quality craftsmanship, this is your game.</desc>

    <desc>NHL Breakaway 98 offers one of the most original features ever to appear in a hockey game: the Momentum-Based Checking System. Players can actually out-skate and out-muscle each other, depending on a player's size and speed. For example, some players may be smaller but are fast, while others may be slow but possess the strength and size to do all the dirty work. For instance, if a large, fast player such as Eric Lindros gets moving at high speed, the power behind his check is greater than what someone like Pierre Turgeon could produce. The game sports most of the usual play modes, and you can always take on a friend in the Versus mode. If you edit a player, the name and number will appear on the player's back, which is a great feature that lets you put yourself in the game. This game does not feature play-by-play announcers, but there is a public address announcer in the game that only speaks when penalties are called and when a player scores a goal the name and number are said.</desc>

    <desc>NHL Open Ice is the NBA Jam for ice hockey, with a 2 on 2 arcade action featuring a full NHL license including actual team names and logos and 120 actual NHLPA players with reflective stats for the 1995-96 season.

The game features power-ups that will aid the players along during a game including the "Hot Meter" which is filled with every score, body check and steals. Once the meter is full, the player will literally catch fire and their stats will max out for a brief period of time, allowing the player to score goals better, steal the puck more often, etc.

There is five difficulty settings and adjustable options such as period time times and cheat options such as "Big Head" mode and multiplayer capabilities for either head-to-head action or co-op play. Chicago Blackhawks announcer, Pat Foley, lends his voice talents to the game for in-game commentary.</desc>

The basic concept is a fast-paced game of three on three, with the player free to choose among premade arcade teams or seven-man versions of actual NHL teams. In the former instance, the player can play as one of the premade teams such as the Brigade, Demons or Psycho-delics, or a separate team can be created, albeit with the player able to create only the team name and to choose two of the available shift combinations. The latter instance has the player working through the ranks of the NHL squads, starting with the worst teams from the 1998-1999 season, and eventually facing the Stanley Cup champions from that year, the Dallas Stars.</desc>

Then one day, after returning home from a fishing trip, the Vikings get captured by Tomator again. Tomator then calls upon a robotic guard to send them into the Arena, which unfortunately falls short when a system failure happens. During the blackout, the three Vikings dismantle the robot piece by piece and wear its parts on their body, thus granting them new abilities. The three Vikings are then sent through time once again when Olaf pulls the switch on the time machine that says "Do Not Touch", which he mistakes for donuts. Equipped with the new robotic gear from the robot guard they destroyed earlier, Erik, Olaf, and Baleog must fight their way through time once again in order to find their way back home. Along the way, they befriend a wolf named Fang (whom they continuously humorously mistake for a different animal) and a dragon named Scorch.</desc>

    <name>Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen</name>
    <desc>Twenty-five years ago Empress Endora conquered the entire continent of Zetegenia. Her reign proved to be tyrannical, and people of different social classes and positions began to long for a better future. Eventually, a resistance movement called the Liberation Army was formed. The protagonist (whose name and background are chosen by the player) takes command of the new army, and leads his allies towards a revolution.

Ogre Battle has elements of a real-time strategy game and a tactical RPG. The player manages a large army consisting of characters belonging to a vast amount of different classes. These classes include military specializations as well as mythological creatures such as dragons, angels, hellhounds, undead trees, etc. Each class its own unique characteristics and abilities in battle. For example, vampires and werewolves can only be deployed when the battle takes place during the night.

The player moves troops in real time on the tactical map. Individual battles between units are handled in a turn-based RPG style. The player is able to select general commands for the battle, as well as use powerful tarot cards for special techniques. Characters level up, change classes and grow stronger over the course of the game. The player can also purchase items in towns.

The protagonist's reputation is affected by the player's decisions during the storyline. The player can make choices that may prove to be popular or unpopular with the nation in contact with the Liberation Army. In addition, every character has his or her own alignment, ranging from good to evil. Liberating towns with evil characters may lower the army's reputation. These and other choices affect the plot's development and eventually lead to one of the thirteen possible endings.</desc>

It's all there, from running and jumping, to swimming, shooting, and weight lifting. All of the events look realistic, thanks to motion-captured animation--you will see how athletes really jump over a seven-foot tall bar. And clearing that seven-foot hurdle will help you destroy the computer-controlled competition. However, it would be much more fun to smoke seven of your friends and rub their faces in your superiority as a virtual athlete. Most people will never be able to compete in the Olympics, but with OLYMPIC SUMMER GAMES for the PlayStation, you can come awfully close.</desc>

    <desc>The world's youngest superhero, Pajama Sam, is back in his third adventure, Pajama Sam: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet. Serious trouble is brewing on Mop Top Island as the food groups battle for supremacy. The fats and the sweets are forcing the healthy foods off the island and are quickly increasing their numbers in an attempt to take control. To regain order, an emergency Peace Conference has been called to work out a compromise between all the food groups. Compounding the problem is the disappearance of four of the six delegates. 

It's up to Pajama Sam to find the missing delegates and save the day. Along the way, Pajama Sam interacts with many comical characters such as General Beetfoot, the commander in chief of the healthy food groups, Florette, the intelligent broccoli, Granny Smythe, the elderly green apple with so many stories, Sprinkle, a gentle doughnut, Bean Number 47, the distinguished kidney bean, and Zak Zuke, a zucchini with a knack for guessing weight. 

Pajama Sam: You Are What You Eat From Your Head to Your Feet focuses on strategic thinking and developing decision making skills. Children find puzzles and play mini arcade-style games throughout the story. They unclog a pipe at the Funny Bone, create punch lines to Mickey Hollandaise's already bad jokes, hop on spinning walnuts to keep from getting dunked in the caramel pit, and search the library for an important manual without getting caught by the cranky garlic librarian.. 

Features: 
* Help Sam search for clues and solve problems 
* Join Pajama Sam on Mop Top Island where food can walk, talk and even tell jokes 
* It's a different game each time you play</desc>

They had gone to Lancelot Castle to attend a "Wizards in Training" seminar. Nikki, a talented acrobat with swift reflexes, had become irritated with her dull carnival life on the high-wire. After forgetting to feed the lions, and the trainer almost having his arm chewed off, she decided it was time to run away and become a wizard! Fargus and Sid had been spending their lives together traveling from fair to festival entertaining and embarrassing people here and there. Their act, however, was as old as the hills and usually turned into a bombardment of fruits and eggs. They, too, were a little tired of same old routine and had heard about the Wizards seminar.</desc>

The game offers two main modes, Tank Select and Tactics. Tank Select is an arcade-style mode, with exaggerated tank capabilities and basic missions, most revolving around killing whatever moves. Tactics offers a selection of 28 different maps with a variety of terrain, opposition, and victory conditions. The missions are almost evenly divided between Russian, American, and German missions, but secondary factors mix things up so thoroughly that the different capabilities of each army's tanks are only a small drop in the bucket full of strategic factors you have to consider.</desc>

In campaign mode, player assumes the role of german commander and fights in a series of historical and fictional scenarios (including  invasion of Great Britain, German victory in Stalingrad and even the attack on US soil). The novelty during the time of the game's release was not only the long (and in some cases, branched) campaign mode, but also the ability to reuse his troops from previous scenarios. Those units gained experience and carried it from battle to battle and could be upgraded with so called "prestige points", given to the commander for destroying enemy, claiming cities and ending battles in as few turns as possible.</desc>

    <desc>PEAK PERFORMANCE is a racing game based on the Chevrolet Pikes Peak International Hill Climb. The signature course, Pikes Peak Hill Climb, is a solitary climb up a mountain, with more turns on one track than most have in an entire game. This track, as with half of the other four courses, features a combination of dirt and pavement in both urban and rural settings, providing enough variety and difficulty to keep things interesting. Each of the game's 25 cars has its own feel, giving the game a good amount of depth and keeping the replay value high. Each car can also be colored, named, and completely customized, right down to the wheels.</desc>

    <desc>Pitfall 3D is a 3D platformer in which players guide Pitfall Harry Jr. (the original Pitfall! hero's son, voiced by B-movie king Bruce Campbell) through a wide variety of settings, ranging from the South American jungle to the ruins of the Moku civilization that lie behind a dimensional rift.

Some old obstacles and enemies appear, such as tar pits that can open up beneath Harry and swallow him whole, ever-present scorpions, and old favorites like rolling logs and handy vines, which can be found smattered around the jungle. But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense.

Harry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old Dad.</desc>

Originally introduced in 1994 as an arcade gallery shooter, the game focused on the player's ability to aim accurately and shoot fast.

In 1998, the idea remains the same, though Namco has made a few adjustments for this home version. Packaged with the company's own Guncon light gun, Point Blank offers the full arcade game with new gallery shooting levels, a Training Mode, and a multiplayer mode (head-to-head or tournament).</desc>

    <desc>Point Blank 2 is the sequel to the now classic arcade game Point Blank, which was converted to the PlayStation in 1998. Using the Namco built GunCon (an arcade-like light gun), it offers 70 new shooting galleries, different party modes and a new single-player game.

If you're playing single-player, you have a few options from which to choose. The arcade mode is simply 16 rounds (of either beginner, advanced or insane difficulty) selected randomly from the 70 different shooting galleries. You'll get to shave sheep by shooting off their wool, test your accuracy in one-shot, one-hit bouts and save Dr. Don and Dr. Dan from wacky situations. There is also an endurance mode in which you climb a tall tower to see how far you can get in three tries.</desc>

    <desc>The escapades of Namco's Dr. Dan and Dr. Don continue in Point Blank 3, the third edition of the irreverent, mini-game based light-gun series. A selection of 80 events are offered, many of which thrust the hapless duo into situations that require timely intervention by the player on their behalf, testing your reflexes and shooting accuracy at the same time. The myriad of events present the player with basic tasks that range in both scope and difficulty. A plethora of mini-game formats are provided that include shooting color-coded targets to protecting the two numbskulls from threatening objects, to those that require the player to perform rudimentary mathematics calculations before shooting the correct answer. Cameo appearances by Tekken characters, classic Namco franchises and other such in-jokes abound in the many scenarios players will find themselves embroiled.</desc>

    <desc>You've long been an admirer of the snowmobile racing greats, and you've finally earned the right to start competing against them. You just qualified for amateur certification a few days ago, but you're already being thrown into the fray against the best in the game . Giving you a total of 10 tracks to show your stuff on, the game uses a high overhead view to display the competition. Each course lands somewhere between a realistic slope and a roller coaster ride, delivering pure, white-knuckle excitement. In addition to the 10 regular tracks, there are two cross-country tracks that'll give your fingers a workout. Each race that you win in a tournament earns you points that will help you soup up your snowmobile. You begin with three points, which can be spread out or allocated to one particular feature. POLARIS SNOWCROSS is a unique game, balancing racing with a little bit of legitimate story. The graphics and sound alone are enough to add this title to your library, but the gameplay brings it to the upper echelon. The game also supports two-player competition.</desc>

Throughout the twenty-five missions of the campaign, the player leads their tribe across a solar system, dominating enemy tribes and tapping new sources of magic, with the ultimate goal of the shaman attaining godhood herself.</desc>

If it sounds fun now, wait 'till you play it...

Set in seven different 3D environments strewn with throwable objects, the game challenges you to a match against three other opponents armed with logs, rocks, ice blocks, and atomic bombs. If you run out of stuff to throw, you can toss your opponents around too. Each hit drops your life meter, so be careful who you pick a fight with.</desc>

Into this new radiation-scarred world, primitively referred to as "Urth", primordial rainforest has covered the land and numerous new species have evolved.

Out of their ranks emerge seven creatures who wage war for control over the new world; they are torn between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for personal gain. These creatures have otherworldly or supernatural abilities and each is said to represent a different aspect of nature i.e. life and death, fire and ice; and they are considered to be a "god" of their respective sphere.

There are four "Virtuous Gods" and three "Destructive Gods" (although these terms are presumably relative, since the character Sauron is counted as "good" despite being described as "constantly hungry" and a destructive tyrant).</desc>

    <desc>Timeshock! is a 1997 pinball computer game developed by Cunning Developments and published by Empire Interactive. It is the second game in the Pro Pinball series, and is themed around the concept of time travel.

The inclusion of a time machine fixture on the table facilitates the game's time travel theme. At any one time the player is in one of a handful of time zones, the main ones being: The Present Day, The Distant Future, Ancient Rome and The Prehistoric Age. Completion of certain objectives allows the player to travel between time zones (although some must be unlocked first, by means of completing secondary objectives).

Although the basic method of playing is persistent across time zones, the details of particular awards and objectives are themed towards the current time, for example, you might be awarded with a ray gun in the future, whilst in the present day you might be awarded with a magnet. This provides variety, and helps facilitate a wider set of goals.</desc>

    <desc>A combination of ice hockey, basketball, and bare-knuckle fighting, Professional Underground League of Pain is a futuristic sports game with few rules and loads of violence. The object of the game is to throw a plasma ball into a round goal that is suspended above the middle of a hockey-sized arena. Before you or your computer opponent can make a basket, the ball must be charged. Each team's charger is located in their opponents end of the court. Be careful, though: If the ball is charged with your opponent's color and you make a basket, your opponent gets the points. The same rule applies for the opposing team. There are different zones on the court and depending on where a player is standing when he makes a shot, he will score one, two, or three points.

There are sixteen different teams to choose from, representing the countries of England, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Russia. Each team has four players on the court at once. Most of the action consists of passing, shooting, and stealing the ball, punching and sliding into your opponents, and a whole lot of running.</desc>

Psychic Detective is an interactive movie with adventure elements. The player can choose people whose minds Eric is able to read, and also interact with objects for further insight into the storyline.

So begins this adventure of a hip skunk and his 30 levels of platforming action, taking him through the sky, across land, underneath the ground and over water. Multiple paths and bonus levels will offer some variety in this throwback to 2D platform games of the past.

In order to succeed, Punky must use various moves to fight enemies, avoid traps and find the flagpole signifying the end of the level. In addition, you'll be able to collect stars and 1-ups for extra lives, green orbs to replenish health, and gear icons outfitting Punky with one of six pieces of equipment: Paraglider, Inline Skates, Skysurfer, Pogo Stick, Jetpack or Diggers. Besides using the gear, Punky can either jump or attack enemies with his "spray." Skunk got you stumped? Not to worry, you can resume progress at the start of each cleared stage if you have a memory card.</desc>

    <desc>In this vaguely Tetris-like game, players score points by eliminating "star blocks." A star block is a colored rectangle with a star on one end of it, and blocks are eliminated when the stars of two like-colored blocks touch each other. While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen. The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks</desc>

The four play settings include Single Race (which can be set to head-on or suicide modes, having you race against one or three vehicles driving in the opposite direction), Season, Time Trial and Practice. A new 3D engine allows for visible damage and effects such as reflections and mud sticking to your car or truck. Speaking of vehicles, you select from a pool of ten with different ratings in power, top speed and weight. 

You can also customize shocks, steering response, brakes, gearing ratios, transmission, tires (choose from all purpose, off-road, snow or slick) and even paint--both body and detail colors can be set to your liking. Yet the most notable addition is the track editor, which allows you to build your own course from scratch or modify an existing one to add more jumps, 90 degree turns, mud pits, and several other features. In total, there are 16 different track pieces you can position on an 8 x 8 grid using one of three themes: desert, snow or forest. Rally Cross 2 also supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller and up to two players for head-to-head competition.

    <desc>Rampage is a series of video games released by Midway for various consoles. The basic premise of the series is that the player controls a human transformed into a giant monster by a lab accident. The gameplay revolves around using your monster to destroy cities around the world while attacking or avoiding military forces. 

Rampage Through Time is the fourth game in the Rampage series. It was released on June 9, 2000. Its predecessor is Rampage 2: Universal Tour and it is followed by Rampage: Total Destruction. In the game, 7 previous Scumlabs monsters, plus a new one, use a time machine to rampage through time.

The world is again rebuilding after the events of Universal Tour. To clean up the mess quicker, Scumlabs invent a time machine to send people back in time to fix the mess without having to do it in the present. Unfortunately, the monsters, who have somehow made it back to Earth, appear and run into the machine. They begin terrorizing the past, present, and future, messing up the time stream.</desc>

    <desc>Rat Attack! is an action-oriented puzzle game that has players trying to contain as many rambunctious rats as possible within each stage or level. Played from an overhead perspective, the game stars eight felines called the Scratch Cats, who agree to use futuristic devices to ensnare their prey as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Gameplay involves using the analog stick to box in one or more rats before carrying them to a designated ring called the "destructor."

As players frantically move to eliminate rats from each area, they will run across power-ups like speed boosts or shields to make the job easier. Time is of the essence, as the varmints will do their best to destroy specific objects in each of the 50 single-player stages. Rat Attack! also features three multiplayer modes: Beat the Clock, Score Chase, and Rat Chase. Up to four players will compete to remove rats within a time limit, to reach a certain point total, or to eradicate their color-coded rats before their rivals.</desc>

Combining speed with elements from the previous title, players take their scooters and hit one of three locales in an attempt to become a racing legend. Each location (city streets, mall, and an industrial compound) is composed of three separate sections.

In the first round, players qualify for the race by completing three laps within the allotted time. Next, players race by challenging two other opponents in a three-lap challenge. Completing these two objectives will open up the area's skatepark, and by beating the park's overall score, a new member will be added to the racing team.</desc>

    <name>Resident Evil: Director's Cut</name>
    <desc>Resident Evil: Director's Cut is a reissue of the original Resident Evil. Unlike Resident Evil for the GameCube, it is not a remake of the original game, instead, it is more of a slight remix.

There are three gameplay modes available. "Original" contains the original game with no changes or additions. "Beginner" features double the amount of ammunition and save ribbons, plus increased health for the player, increased damage for their weapons, and an auto-target feature.

"Arrange" mode is the "Director's Cut" version of the original. The default outfits for Jill, Chris, and Rebecca are changed, new camera angles are introduced, and the placement of key items is changed. Most of these changes are designed to play against the expectations of veteran players of the first Resident Evil - so zombie dogs may smash through new windows, or keys will not be where they were, forcing players to hunt for them anew. The default Beretta pistol is also changed to a chromed version with a randomized chance to kill standard zombies in one shot.

The original release of the Director's Cut advertised an uncut version of the opening cinema, in full color, and never-before seen. Notable aspects of this video include shots of a corpse with bites taken out of the face, close-ups of zombie dogs bleeding when shot, and graphic quick-cuts of Joseph being bitten by these dogs. Chris is also shown smoking in his introduction, which was cut from Western releases. However, only the French and German releases contained this footage. U.S. and UK versions retained the censored black-and-white video shipped with the original release. This has never been corrected, either in the Greatest Hits reissue, or with the PSOne Classics downloads on the Playstation Network.

The original issue of the Director's Cut contained a demo of Resident Evil 2 on a second disc. The "Greatest Hits" re-release added Dual Shock support for the controller (left "movement" stick only).</desc>

The gameplay is quite similar to that of the previous games: the player-controlled racer must avoid oncoming cars and obstacles on the road, beating opponents with metal pipes, crowbars, and other assorted damage-inflicting tools. The player wins money upon the completion of the race, and eventually can afford to buy better bikes. The courses are formed from connecting points in an environmental grid, which means that the player can utilize different stretches of courses to advance.</desc>

    <desc>ReBoot puts you in the role of Bob the Guardian, a fearless hero tasked to protect the city of Mainframe and its people from any outside threats. In the game's opening cutscenes, the threat is considerable -- Megabyte and Hexidecimal, the show's two main villains, have formed an uneasy alliance to take over Mainframe and destroy it if necessary.

Your mission is to find "tears" in the fabric of space, located throughout the streets of Mainframe and across seven different levels, and seal them before time runs out. Several of the tears are guarded by automatic defenses, which can rapidly chew through Bob's health. Power-ups replenish Bob and repair the damage, but you have to go looking for those too. Handy weapons also appear from time to time, including rocket launchers that can fire guided projectiles and are capable of firing multiple missiles at once.</desc>

    <desc>In this one-on-one fighting game based on the famous plastic robot fighters, players not only get to pit various Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots up against one another, they also get to customize their bots' various parts to make them even more steel-twisting and destructive than before.

Players initially have 12 different robots to choose from before they head off to the arena. With names such as Slamurai, Sir Haxalot, and General Warfare, it's easy to see that Mattel Interactive is going for a bit of a tongue-and-cheek feel. While the names aren't overly serious, the fighting is less comedic, with the robots throwing all of their various armaments at their opponents in order to assure destruction. These weapons are varied, from swords to bombs to Gatling guns. Each robot starts with a different set of weapons, and depending on the mode you're playing, their attacks can be altered and switched around.</desc>

    <desc>In a world destroyed by pollution, nuclear war and poverty, vacationers have become hot property. They feel the need to escape from their everyday existence and go on vacations! Big Daddy is the vacation king at the moment, and he's provided some really fabulous getaways for these people. But who's going to get paid for taking the vacationers to luxurious landmarks and resorts? Well, you are!

The "not-right" folks at Singletrac are at it again with Rogue Trip: Vacation 2012, the "spiritual successor" to Twisted Metal 2. In it, you chose one of 16 wacky, down-right sick "automercenaries" and compete with your enemies to pick up the tourists and take them to photo-ops. Doing this gets you lots of money, which can be used buy weapon upgrades and health. But your enemies really don't want you to have the money -- and they shoot back.</desc>

On top of the basic racing concept, the cars can be equipped with weapons, that are picked up on the track as bonuses, which can be used against competing cars. The automobiles themselves, once again, have wheels that are larger than the body of the car thus creating a car that has no 'right way up' and can be flipped and continue to drive.</desc>

Played from an over-the-shoulder perspective, players will guide Rosco through burning rooms filled with innocent hostages, power-ups, and secret items. It is advised that players move with extreme caution as there's a host of hazards including backdrafts, flame-overs, dangerous smoke, and electrical fires. There are 12 hazards in all, each taking hose precision and brainpower to overcome.

In addition to the various hazards, Rosco will use his trusty axe to dismantle his enemies and break down locked doors. While the fearless firefighter is rescuing hostages and hosing down the flames, he'll need to be on the lookout for any bombs. Those pesky A-Bots are bomb crazy; they're placing the destructive devices all over the place. Players are also required to keep an eye on the temperature. If a room gets too hot, the sirens will sound and the game will end.</desc>

    <desc>Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends was an animated program, that originally aired in 1999 as part of BKN, the syndicated's cartoon programing block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves.

On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race.</desc>

    <desc>In RPG Maker, players with absolutely no programming experience or prior game-production skills can make their own role-playing quests and save them to the PlayStation memory card for themselves or a friend to enjoy. The world creation in the game is tile-based, and the entire game is done in the 2D style of 16-bit era RPGs. Players can create characters, towns, dungeons and script action to move along at a certain pace. They will place treasures, enter dialogue and create events that are triggered by certain actions within the game world.

Although players can create nearly anything they like with the game, it must be more or less contained in a fantasy theme, as the only graphics available adhere to that specific genre. Within that genre, however, the possibilities are varied, and you can make your new RPG a massive epic or a short jaunt. It can be utterly serious or laced with juvenile humor. Also contained within RPG Maker is a mode called Anime Maker, where those with the desire can create 2D pictures and animate them accordingly.</desc>

    <desc>A racing game in the purest sense of the word, Running Wild pits six bipedal animals against one another in a footrace across six diverse environments (two of which must be unlocked), with the sole aim of being crowned the fastest animal on the planet.

The menagerie of racers includes Mei-Ling the panda, Gwynn the rabbit, Brazz the zebra, General the mountain ram, Coronado the bull, and Boris the elephant. The courses, taking place in remote locations such as the arctic, jungle, and desert, are littered with hazards and power-ups to both aid and hinder your progress. The former is made up of a plethora of obstacles such as pipes, ice and lava pits, thorn patches, and other such impediments, many of which must be cleared using your animal's innate jumping ability.

The power-ups provided allow characters to fly; turn into ghosts in order to avoid obstructions; transform the course into mud or ice or even increase in size in order to squash any competitors in their path. Speed strips are scattered about the locales and will provide much-needed boosts when run over.</desc>

    <desc>The third incarnation of the 2D fighting game Samurai Shodown is now available on the PlayStation with the release of Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood. The game revolves around the evil Zankuro Minazuki. Zankuro ravaged lands, tortured innocent people, and burned villages to the ground. Rightfully nicknamed "The Demon," Zakuro attacked hundreds of people, becoming famous for his extreme brutality.

Now 12 mighty warriors search for the crazed Zankuro, each with their own agenda and reason for wanting to kill him. Most are in it for revenge of a loved one killed by Zankuro's sword, some are greedy for his demonic power, and others want to save him and turn him to the good side of nature.</desc>

    <desc>San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing for the PlayStation is based on the 1996 hit arcade game by Atari Games. Players will race through locations based on San Francisco cities, rural areas, and suburban neighborhoods. Environments can also be cycled through day, night, and snow conditions in order to add some variety and challenge to the racing action.

Players can alter their view of their car from a third-person perspective to a first-person view looking through the windshield. There are eight available cars to choose from that vary in speed and control as well as four difficulty levels (Beginner, Advanced, Expert, and Extreme). The higher the difficulty, the more control is sacrificed in order to increase the maximum speed. Car colors can also be customized to your liking, and there is a choice between manual and automatic gear transmissions.</desc>

Released to correlate with the same-titled movie, this seven-stage, multilevel adventure puts the Mystery Inc. gang in the middle of cyberspace warding off bad guys and evildoers in their attempt to locate the Phantom Virus.

From a control room players can access the areas of Japan, Ancient Rome, Arctic Circle, Prehistoric Jungle, The Big City, Egypt, and an Amusement Park. Each area consists of three levels including the boss level, but initially only the Japan area can be accessed with other areas becoming available as play progresses.

    <name>Scrabble</name>
    <desc>Hasbro Interactive's best-selling computer title based on one of the world's most famous word games has made the translation to the PlayStation with real-time 3D graphics and support for up to four players. As with the two previous CD-ROM games, Scrabble for the PlayStation even contains the Merriam Webster's Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary, 3rd Edition, so players can look up definitions to certain words (not all are available, however) and determine if a word actually exists.

For those unfamiliar with the board game from which this title is based, Scrabble involves forming words using wooden tiles representing individual letters. These tiles are then placed into rows on a board made up of 225 spaces. Each letter is worth a certain point value, and some of the spaces will offer specific bonuses if you manage to build off them. The player with the most points after all the tiles have been placed on the board is considered the winner. The PlayStation version follows this same format, but with automatic scoring and a computer opponent named Maven with eight selectable difficulty levels.</desc>

Rather, players compete against themselves, trying to finish each track while running over icons placed around each stage. There aren't any losers in this game, and players will be praised players no matter how they finish.

The events include unicycle riding, bathtub boating, sledding and inline skating. The game is filled with Sesame Street favorites, such as Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Elmo, and Ernie, and the interface has been made as simple as possible. Each event comes with a spoken tutorial and there are three difficulty levels that affect the number of obstacles on the course.</desc>

Unable to even determine the remains of his own house, the young man was now an orphan. Upon meeting a mystic named Windleaf, the two decided to embark upon a journey to find out what happened.

Their adventure in Shadow Madness will span across the entire fantastic world of Arkose, even to the unexplored area known as Wyldern. Meeting up with four other unique warriors along the way (the droid-like Harv-5, a magical floating head named Xero Von Moon, a cyborg-like Gadgeteer called Clemett and Wyldern-native Jirina), the group strives to seek out and destroy the source of Arkose's destruction.

In classic RPG style, they'll confront evil minions through random encounters, avoidable if the party hides quickly enough upon hearing the wild sounds of the enemy. After each successful encounter, the party is rewarded with experience points, often accompanied by gold and items useful to its journey. Once characters have enough experience points, they advance in level, increasing such abilities as attack strength, defense, agility (ability to evade attacks), prowess (ability to strike hits) and speed (how often they can attack).</desc>

    <name>Shanghai: True Valor</name>
    <desc>Shanghai: True Valor is a 3D puzzler based on the classic Oriental games Mah Jong and Shanghai. Each game starts off with a stack of tiles arranged in a pyramid shape. In order to win, the player is required to match up tiles by finding "free" tiles of the same type.

For instance, some tiles have numbers and some have pictures; the object is to find a tile not restricted, blocked, or under another tile. Once a player matches up two tiles of the same type, they are removed and the pyramid is reduced. By removing tiles, previously restricted tiles may be opened up. Gameplay flows in this fashion until there are no more tiles or a stalemate. Stalemates are very common and occur when there are no possible matches or moves remaining.</desc>

Players take the role of the Earthly "herders" to lead the flocks through six worlds with multiple levels, eventually reaching special rendezvous point where they'll be loaded onto UFOs for the trip back to their home world of Ovis Aries. No direct control is exerted on the sheep so players must manipulate objects and obstacles, as well as rely on the strengths of each herder, to accomplish the tasks. Levels have time limits and a minimum number of sheep to be saved from each flock.</desc>

    <desc>Having served in combat for the United States, Da Wardenz are out for one thing -- justice. This anti-terrorist tank force was conceived after an ill-fated campaign at Mostvia Vatska in 1994. Coming under heavy fire, the troops sent a distress signal to the U.S. Intelligence requesting immediate backup. The government turned their backs on the Special Forces unit by making them expendable and refusing to send in backup. As a result, five men survived; those five men formed Da Wardenz.

Here's where you come into play. Assuming the role of a rookie commando, your mission is simple: prove yourself to Da Wardenz by destroying terrorist forces and rectifying global corruption. Easy, huh? That's not all -- you'll be in command of an M-13 Predator battle tank; this thing can mow down forests and calm any terrorist dispute. Along the way, you can upgrade your tank in armaments and shielding.

Shellshock is broken into two parts: The Pen and actual mission objectives. As Da Wardenz headquarters, The Pen has all sorts of locations including the main hangar, basketball court, simulation room, workshop area, briefing area, and various lockers. Before a mission, you'll want to explore the headquarters and interact with each member of the team; you may learn something. When you're ready to kick some terrorist butt, you'll simply walk to the tank area and hop in!</desc>

Gameplay involves flying a fighter with a cockpit view. The HUD includes a radar showing the enemy fighters locations plus the number of enemies left. There is also a rear view mirror which lets the player see if there are any enemy fighters on their tail. Players can fire their air-to-air, air-to-surface, and air-to-ground missiles at enemy units.

Options let the player adjust the difficulty level and change the controls between easy or hard.</desc>

    <desc>Silent Hill is a 1999 survival horror video game for the PlayStation. The first in a series about a mysterious town of the same name, Silent Hill generated a direct sequel, three indirect sequels, a prequel and a film adaptation. The game was included in Sony's Greatest Hits and Platinum Range of budget titles as a result of strong sales. A reinterpretation of the game was developed for the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable.
The plot focuses on Harry Mason as he searches for his daughter, Cheryl, who has disappeared following a car accident which left Harry unconscious. He finds Silent Hill to be largely abandoned, shrouded in a thick fog, snowing out of season, filled with monsters and being over taken by a hellish otherworld. As Harry scours the town, he begins learning about the history of Silent Hill and stumbles upon a cult ritual undertaken to bring a god to Earth.</desc>

    <name>Silverload</name>
    <desc>SilverLoad is the title of a graphic adventure video game produced by Vic Tokai in 1996. In this single-player game, you control, via a first person perspective, a Wild West cowboy as he ventures into a haunted town in order to save two children that were taken from their parents.

The U.S. based Entertainment Software Ratings Board gave the game a "M" rating for its graphic violence, blood and gore, and bits of profanity. The game was released for the personal computer in Europe, and the original PlayStation edition was given an international release.

As is the case with other graphic adventure games, progress in SilverLoad involves finding and interacting with various "hot spots" in order to pick up objects, solve puzzles and interact with (or kill) the various characters in the town. Picking up certain objects will cause the game's (and town's) clock to move forward, and thus, the trick to success is to pick up the right items in the precise order. Otherwise, you have to restart the game from the beginning, or from wherever you saved the game.</desc>

Because the task can get difficult at times, he has enlisted the service of fearsome ape-like creatures, Skullmonkeys, to aid in the destruction of planet Idznak. Needless to say, it is up to the player to stop Kogg and his devious plans.

Steeped within the realm of medieval fantasy, players will find themselves confronted by a cadre of mythological beasts, including skeletons, dragons, serpents, and various flying entities, as well as large end-of-level boss creatures. In Arcade mode, defeated enemies yield both power-ups and magic spells, the latter imbuing your chosen character with any number of devastating attacks.

Players are equipped with a small paddle, capable only of horizontal movement, which they maneuver so as to deflect a tiny ball around the screen -- the ball will destroy any brick it contacts, while continuing to ricochet.

Failing to keep the ball in play will result in the loss of a life -- lose three and the game is over. Destroying certain bricks will result in power-ups being dropped into play, which will alter such variables as the size of the paddle and the number of balls onscreen at any one time, to name but two. Power-ups can also be purchased between stages in order to better equip oneself for precarious situations that may lie ahead.</desc>

A complete 3D fighting game that allows for side steps, Soul Blade has twelve colorful fighters (ten standard, two hidden, plus additional costumes for a few fighters), each with various weapons and styles. The first ten can be used in all the combat modes, while the hidden two can only be used in versus and arcade mode.

Namco enhanced the arcade version (called Soul Edge) by adding a well done CGI intro, plus a story mode to the addition of the traditional team, survival, and time attack modes. The story mode goes into greater detail about each character, and is presented in an ancient book format. The story mode also allows you to unlock more of each characters' extra weapons. These weapons, which vary in lengths, stats, and durability, add to the options available players in the versus mode.</desc>

While you begin the game as a rookie, you will eventually command a team of your own, issuing orders on the overhead tactical screen to carry out the mission at hand. Once finished, the game will switch to a first-person perspective looking through the visor of your Tactical Dreadnought armor.

Missions range from sealing off doors to prevent Genestealers from escaping to placing explosive charges in key sectors, or carrying specific objects from one part of the ship to another. You'll also have to be on the lookout and protect your team from five types of enemies: pure-strain Genestealers, Hybrids, Magi, Patriarchs and Chaos Space Marines. Should any member of your squad perish, you'll have to continue the next mission shorthanded!</desc>

When you approach an enemy, however, the engine switches into something between a 3D fighting game and an old-fashioned side-scrolling beat-em-up. Spawn must defeat one or more enemies, who may be surrounding him before he can continue.</desc>

    <desc>The first Spec Ops title on the PlayStation to feature a third-person 3D shooting style, Spec Ops: Airborne Commando literally drops you behind enemy lines as an elite U. S. Ranger paratrooper equipped with essential gear and a lethal arsenal. Weapons include a standard military knife, a Colt 1911A1 Semiautomatic pistol, silenced M4 rifle, sniper rifle (Barret M82A1), the M3 RAAW reusable launcher rifle, hand grenades, and C4 demolition packs. Binoculars, a laptop, and a handheld radio round out the inventory, with satellite imaging available for locating positions of rangers, checkpoints, helicopter extractions, and both real and decoy SAM launchers.

Players earn awards and promotions for successfully completing the 16 missions, with scores based on factors such as reconnaissance and intelligence recovered, rescue of hostages, enemies killed, and demolition. Ten ranks can be achieved, ranging from Private E1 to Sergeant Major and, depending on success, six decorations and medals can be earned, including The Purple Heart, Bronze or Silver Stars and the Congressional Medal of Honor. Airborne Commando features five difficulty settings, ranging from Super Easy (10 extra lives) to Super Hard (no extra lives).</desc>

    <desc>Spec Ops: Covert Assault is the third game in the budget-priced Spec Ops line for the PlayStation. The series takes the first-person shooter genre and attempts to fuse it with aspects of real combat, in the hopes of giving players a sense of what it is actually like to take on dangerous black ops military missions. Covert Assault is no different in this regard, as you'll take on the role of two different elite rangers as they scour the globe, quietly ridding it of evil at every turn.

In Covert Assault, you choose two rangers from a host of different soldiers with their own abilities. Select from the machine gunner, close-quarters fighter, sniper, grenadier, and rifleman. Once you've chosen your rangers, you will be able to customize them with a whole host of different guns and items such as body armor and grenades. You then enter into the game, which is made up of four different missions, ranging from the island of Sicily to the deep anonymous jungles of a far away place.</desc>

    <desc>The original Spec Ops for PC was one of the first realistic military tactical combat simulators to be released. After its limited success it spawned many rehashes, pseudo-sequels, and mission packs all bearing the same name. The Playstation's version of the rehash is Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol. Up to two players can simultaneously play through the series of missions the game has to offer. If there's only one player the second ranger is controlled by the CPU. The single player can switch between both rangers at any time, letting the CPU control the other ranger.

Join one of the most elite military task forces in the world--the U.S. Army Rangers. Play as a U.S. Special Operations Ranger Corps soldier in this third-person shooter. Your main objective: neutralize hostile terrorist threats around the world. With guns blazing or silently under the cover of darkness, navigate your team across harsh terrains of thick jungle, barren desert, arctic tundra, and dense forest. You must use stealth and tactics to your advantage. Oh, a few more squad members and weapons that range from sniper rifles to machines guns wouldn't hurt either. Take out terrorists, rescue hostages and save the free world...that's all this game is asking of you. Will you be able to complete your mission, even though you may be the lone survivor?</desc>

Based on the popular cartoon, Speed Racer joins the plethora of racing games available for the PlayStation. As Speed Racer himself, you can race on three different tracks simply titled S, M and L for small, medium and large. Before beginning a race you must choose between three slight variations of Speed Racer's famous white Mach 5, one of which has manual transmission. Each of the three cars is equipped with special features such as grip tires, rotary saws, a periscope, a deflector and auto jacks. Other options include 18 different soundtracks, normal and endurance racing modes and the ability to increase the speed and efficiency of your opponents.</desc>

    <desc>Speedball has been described as a cross between handball, roller derby, and hockey (though it's quite a bit more violent than any of those sports -- all in good fun of course). Two teams of nine players each face off in a closed arena with high walls on all sides and a goal at either end. The object is simply to throw the ball through the opponent's goal to score as many points as possible. Points can be scored in other ways as well however, such as lighting all of the stars on a wall or by hitting Bounce Domes with the ball.

The game is constantly moving as the steel ball is passed back and forth or stolen with a heavy body-slam or a quick elbow to the teeth. Special power-ups can increase scoring possibilities or even temporarily disable opposing players. Several modes of play are available, from quick one-time grudge matches to season-long league play.</desc>

Battle mode lets you and a friend compete in a head-to-head match. The winner is the first to explode their screen's petals. Story mode is like a single-player version of the Battle mode. You'll progress through each character's series of "planets" to get a shot at defeating an evil dictator named Moolamb. Eight characters are initially available, with more waiting to be unlocked.

There is a wide variety of tracks to race on, such as Mosport Park, Road Atlanta, Sebring International Raceway, Desert Speedway, Laguna Seca Raceway and two fantasy courses.

Options include Season, Arcade, and Time Trial modes. Beginning with 50,000 dollars in cash, players will first need to purchase a car for the Season mode, which requires you to finish in the top three positions for each course in order to advance in rank. Along the way, players will earn more cash that can be used for car upgrades. You are given the option to modify brake pads, suspension, exhaust, the engine and gearbox.

The Arcade mode features a single race that allows players to configure conditions to their liking. Finally, the Time Trial allows you to apply your saved car from the Season and run practice laps. You'll get to compete against your own best times and try to set new records.

Additionally, two-player support has been included with the following options: Head to Head, Pace Car, and Pink Slip. The Head to Head mode is a single race where two players compete against each other and the Pace Car option adds a computer controlled car to the race (in addition to the two players). Similar to the previous two, with the Pink Slip mode, players must use modified cars from the Season mode. If you lose the race, your car will be deleted from your memory card and added to the winner's.</desc>

    <desc>Spyro: Year of the Dragon is the third installment in the Spyro series and the last Spyro game to be released for the PlayStation. The game was the last Spyro game Insomniac developed; their next title would be Ratchet &amp; Clank for the PlayStation 2. This is the only Spyro game in the PlayStation library to not get released in Japan.

Named after the animal of the Chinese zodiac, which was the symbol at the time of the game's release, Year of the Dragon follows the titular purple character Spyro as he travels to the "Forgotten Worlds" after 150 magical dragon eggs are stolen from the land of the dragons by an evil sorceress. Players travel across thirty different worlds gathering gems and eggs. Year of the Dragon introduced new characters and minigames to the series, as well as offering improved graphics and music.

Upon release, the game sold more than two million units in the United States,and received positive critical response. Reviewers noted the game built on the successful formula of its predecessors by adding more games and expansive environments. At Game Rankings, Year of the Dragon is one of the top twenty highest-rated PlayStation games of all time.</desc>

    <desc>Spyro the Dragon is a platform game developed by Insomniac Games for the PlayStation. It stars the title character, a young purple dragon named Spyro and his dragonfly friend, Sparx, and is the first game in the Spyro the Dragon series. The first game was massively popular at its initial release and Spyro would later become one of the most recognizable, popular and respected gaming icons for the PlayStation gaming console. Spyro's best friend, Sparx the dragonfly, acts like the player's health meter and assists in gathering gems. The various dragons Spyro unfreezes along the way are also key characters in Spyro's progression through the game. Gnasty Gnorc is the main antagonist, who froze all the dragons of the land in crystal.</desc>

    <desc>3037. FedNet is now in control of the federation, and at an attempt to gain trust of the population following decades of corruption and warfare, the FedNet Space Corps were sent to the outermost planets to crush the small-time warlords still running the show there. After being "convinced" to join them in a tour of duty, he is assigned to an elite flight group with the only purpose of testing the most cutting edge technology.

A remake of the original game of the same title released a few years before for the Acorn Archimedes platform, Starfighter 3000 features more detailed graphics (now all surfaces are texture-mapped and a fogging filter reduces clipping). Featuring 15 levels in 4 worlds, the player controls the Predator Mark-IV, a fighter ship capable of space and atmospheric flight. However, other than the handy boost button, the player has no control over the throttle, and must keep moving at all times.

Two points of view are available: behind (better for acrobatics and general flying) and cockpit (accurate aiming and NOE flight). By picking up crystals the player is able to upgrade his craft and obtain more ammo, and by combining colours, get more powerful weapons, some also obtainable from parachute drops sent by FedNet.</desc>

    <desc>The game gives the player the choice of playing as Rena or Claude, with the journey evolving and ending differently depending on the choices one makes.

Star Ocean: The Second Story is a world of magic, science, space travel and deadly demons! Enter a world where love knows no bounds, the evil is neverending and good can overcome all if the heart is just and true. Featuring three battle modes, the ability to master skills to create items and an emotional level for each of the characters, Enix has pulled out all the stops in their latest (and first) title to be brought to the North American PlayStation.

Star Ocean: The Second Story takes place twenty years after the original game, Star Ocean. Roughly the first half of the plot of the game takes place on the planet Expel, an underdeveloped planet on the verge of its industrial age. On Expel kings still rule over great kingdoms, swords and sorcery dominate the battlefield, and sailing ships are still made from wood. According to a Federation law, named the Undeveloped Planet Protection Treaty, a planet with such a level of civilization may not be directly contacted under any but the most dire circumstances&amp;#x2014;and even then, contact must be minimal and secretive. This law is reminiscent of Star Trek's Prime Directive.</desc>

    <desc>The Borg are once again invading Federation space. Their target? Sector 001, Earth. You are part of an elite flying team known as Valkyrie squadron, commanded by none other than Lieutenant Commander Worf of Star Trek: The Next Generation fame.

You'll fly through different territories and encounter familiar races from the popular television series, including Klingons, Romulans, Borg and a new enemy known as the Kam'Jahtae. There are twists and turns throughout the game as you protect convoys from enemy attacks, engage galaxy class starships, and go on solo retrieve and rescue missions. The storyline is accented by the voices of actors Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean-Luc Picard) and Michael Dorn (Lieutenant Worf).

Your ship is outfitted with phaser cannons and photon torpedoes, both of which you will have to master in order to succeed in your battles with enemy crafts. Users can play from a view behind their ship or from a first-person view inside the cockpit. The game supports analog control as well as force feedback, and uses up one block of memory on the standard PlayStation Memory Card to save progress.</desc>

    <desc>Sanvein is a fast-paced top down shooter where time is of the essence and every moment counts. The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia, called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from Utopia.

The game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each "floor" is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they've cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use.

All the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time.</desc>

    <desc>In Starwinder: The Ultimate Space Race, you assume the role of Conner Rhodes, the first representative of Earth sent to compete in a galaxy-wide race. This isn't an ordinary race, however -- an unknown alien race built magnificent rails/tracks throughout the confines of space. Spanning thousands of miles in length, rails act in such a way that when pilots navigate toward one, it increases the speed of the ship.

As Conner, your overall objective is to bring home the ultimate reward -- the globe-like Starsphere. While your mission sounds fairly basic, it won't be easy; there are seven other pilots vying for the same prize. Residing in the far reaches of the Milky Way, competition includes a half man/half machine humanoid named Ko-Axe, the vengeful Tianna Stone, and an overconfident egomaniac that goes by the name of Dextor -- The Terrible. There are also drone pilots that fill in the rest of the playing field.

Broken into quadrants, there are 44 different rails/tracks in which to race on; there are ten races per quadrant. While the bulk of the game is played against computer-controlled opposition, there are times when you'll race against the clock in a true test of speed and accuracy. Prove yourself worthy and you'll race against an elite group of pilots through Epsilon Indi -- the final railway. If you manage to win this final race, the Starsphere is as good as yours!</desc>

    <desc>It's Street Fighter as you always remember it, with some new moves, characters and combo systems, as well as a more polished look and feel.

The new moves available for each fighter, called Super moves, allow them to fire off very powerful moves. A bar at the bottom of the screen represents the power that you have to use for the moves. You start the first round on 0, and each attack that you make adds power to the bar. Once you reach level 3, you can unleash the special attacks, that can sometimes KO the opponant.

The other major change over the Street Fighter 2 series are the Alpha counters. These can be used to counter an on-coming attack after blocking.</desc>

    <name>Street Racer</name>
    <desc>Just as Street Racer for the Super NES is similar to Super Mario Kart, Street Racer for the PlayStation is similar to Mario Kart 64. Filled with twists and turns, this go-cart racing game allows you or you and a friend to choose from eight different cars, each with its own distinctive character behind the wheel. Up to eight people may play if you have two Multi-Tap controllers.

Each character has his or her own unique weapons. For example, Surf Sister uses Expanding Beach Balls to push other cars out of her way, and her Magnetic Attraction lures cars close so she can use her patented Beach Towel Flick. Another character, Frank Instein, has a Screaming Banshee to scare other players, a batmobile to charge into other players, and a Big Monster Mash punch. Speaking of punch, while the object of this game in each of the 24 tracks is to beat the other seven racers to the finish line, a good part of your time will be spent engaging in combat.</desc>

    <desc>Street Racquetball is one of very few console games featuring the enclosed sport of racquetball, though the first title devoted to the sport, Racquetball, was released in 1981 for the Atari Video Computer System. A1 Games' history of released sports related games includes tennis, boxing, bowling, kickboxing, snowboarding, racing and more.

As in indoor racquetball courts, Street Racquetball's "outdoor" courts contain two sidewalls, a front wall, serving zones, and a receiving line -- but no ceiling. Players can opt for exhibition mode (against the computer), challenge mode (unlock new characters and courts by winning three consecutive matches), training mode (continuous rally solo play), or two-player VS mode. Three difficulty settings offer "easy," "normal." or "hard" gameplay, ball bounce levels can be adjusted to "low," "middle," or "high," and the eight computer-controlled opponents are rated in performance level, type of game, power, speed, and skill. Shots include slams, lobs, and drop shots.</desc>

There is a range of new moves including a double jump, backward somersault and dash, which allows him to perform longer jumps. He also has the ability to boost his weapon, the Cypher sword, enabling it to release homing plasma waves. There is also a Savage Slash attack, with random slashes.

There are numerous bonuses that can be collected in the levels. These either boost Strider's vitality, increase the power of his sword or increase the player's game score. Another addition to the game is a Boss Gauge which lets the player know how much energy the mid- or end of level boss has left before it dies.</desc>

Fighters include the Lightning, Flying Pancake, Ta152 Focke Wulf, Hayate, Shinden and Mosquito. The game is played from a top-down perspective and is reminiscent of 1942 and 1943 by Capcom.

Enemies include various forms of fighter jets swarming the player throughout each level, as well as mid- and end-mission bosses, some of which take up half the player's screen. Destroying onscreen enemies and obtaining power-ups will affect the standard guns on the fighter you are piloting. Traditional powering up of weapons leads to more guns shooting at once as well as additional tracking bullets and lasers.</desc>

Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</desc>

    <desc>Tecmo's Super Shot Soccer is a hybrid of simulation and arcade-styled soccer. Featuring over 30 teams from around the world, the game's play modes are based on international-styled soccer. The four play modes are Test Mode (exhibition play), World Tournament Play (inspired by soccer's World Cup), International League (a round-robin league) and International Cup (a 16 team tournament). Of these modes, only Test Mode allows two players to play the game at the same time.

Differing itself from typical soccer simulation titles, Super Shot Soccer provides over the top arcade-style plays. Called Super Shot Special Moves, each team has two or three special moves that tie into the team's nationality. These provide a unique twist to simulation soccer, as gameplay can be interrupted by national monuments, disaster attacks and more. Special moves can be used to affect both offensive and defensive strategies.</desc>

Once you've selected a biker and his gear you can go onto one of the 21 authentic SuperCross and MotoCross tracks, or hit one of the "local" tracks. Each course is littered with jumps, bumps, spills, and thrills. Why don't you try and catch some big air off one of the jumps? The crowd will go nuts! You don't just have to go for a big jump either, as the game features 15 different tricks that can be pulled off, such as "nac-nacs" and heel clickers.

Now that you know what the game features, look what you can do for competition. You can enter a Career mode, a Two-Player Season Competition, or just go and have a Free Ride for big air and lots of tricks. During your Season modes, you'll go to all of the courses in the game, including twisting courses like Bank One Ballpark. Another feature in the game is the Track Editor. From here you can create a completely original track of your own design that begs for skill to be used, or throw caution to the wind with full-fledged hills and jumps all the way.</desc>

    <desc>That Swagman sure has a lot of nerve! He's another evil, demented fellow who's planning to take over the world for his own personal gain. And this guy means business. You see, he's basically a boogie-man who has the power to entrap people in their own nightmares forever. Fortunately, there are two brave souls out there ready to fight Swagman face to face. Their names are Zac and Hannah, two 8 year old twins.

Swagman is a combination of the platform and adventure genre. While in the "Real World", the game is adventure-like; find and collect items and/or keys to open certain doors. When you enter the dream sequences, called the Territories, the game becomes a platform game. The combination of genres and the whole real world/dream world is a neat idea and throw in some nice, cartoonish and highly colorful graphics and you've got a nifty little game.</desc>

    <desc>Sydney 2000 offers four modes of play including arcade, Olympic, head-to-head and coaching. Up to four players (human or computer-controlled) can participate in arcade and head-to-head modes. Each player can train or control a team of 12 virtual athletes for whichever nationality he or she chooses.

Arcade mode allows you to jump right into any one of the 12 events and test the waters without training your athletes. Two types of play are available: classic and repeat. In classic style, you play all 12 events only once while earning points based on performance in each. Repeat play offers basically the same format with the main difference being the chance to gain higher scores by replaying the events.

Olympic mode lets you train a team of 12 athletes, build strength and morale, sharpen skills and prepare for qualification at Olympic trials. This mode offers a 4-stage approach to reaching the goal of Olympic competition: training, invitation, championship, and then the Games themselves. Gymnastics and field and track are just a couple of the activities practiced in this mode.</desc>

    <desc>Team Losi RC Racer is a one or two-player racing game that features 16 radio-controlled vehicles. You'll be racing against various opponents to unlock new tracks (15 in all), discover new cars and conquer the vast hub system that connects every track together. Discovering new tracks and bonus goodies involves locating any given rainbow-colored gate; after you're familiar with the tracks, you can perfect your times and utilize the gates to your advantage. Of course, you're not required to race every single time you play -- you can explore the tracks for said gates, finding shortcuts that will give you an advantage over the opposition.

Radio-controlled vehicles are based on performance ratings including speed, acceleration, grip and weight. There are four cars to choose from at the start of the game; whereas Krush is average in all areas, the Flame Dragon has incredible handling and acceleration features. Tracks incorporate surreal environments such as beachside raceways, mountainous terrain and a desert.</desc>

If you connect four quads (blocks) of the same color, you'll create a chain reaction that will really give you an advantage. If you find yourself in a pinch, utilize a bomb to temporarily clear your board. There are four gameplay modes to choose from Arcade Competition, Time Trials, Chain Reaction, and Insane and more than 20 levels to master, making TEMCO STACKERS one of the most complete action or puzzle games available.</desc>

From the core of this void, fuseballs, rockets, pulsars, tankers and other hazardous aliens and alien artifacts move toward your ship. Once you clear a screen, you fly into the void and onto the next level. Watch out for spikes as you advance.

This game features three modes of play: Classic Tempest, which is based on the early 1980s Arcade smash simply titled Tempest; an update of Tempest called Tempest X, which features a jump feature, A.I. Droids that help you fight and enhanced graphics and sound; and Tempest Duel, which pits you against a friend and the Generator, which cranks out an endless source of enemies.</desc>

While some bowl left-handed and concentrate on accuracy, others specialize in speed and power. When it's your turn to hurl the ball down the lane, a bowling meter appears -- this meter regulates spinning, power and releasing techniques. Although putting spin on the ball is optional, you'll need to adjust your character's positioning in accordance. Failure to do so may result in an embarrassing gutter ball.</desc>

    <name>Tennis Arena</name>
    <desc>With no stat tweaking and no licenses, Tennis Arena is arcade-style tennis at its most fundamental.

What you have here is single-match or tournament play for up to four players with wacky characters and a few different courts to play on. You can play an obese Chinese man, for example, and compete in a Roman coliseum whose clay surface seems to affect bounce marginally. That's about it for options though. No sim, Tennis Arena serves up roughly the same level of fun as Pong did 25 years ago, albeit now with prettier graphics and the occasional super smash.

The game also features special shots, with visible trails, fighter-plane-like sound effects, and higher ball speed. These must be earned however. After successfully returning the ball over the net six consecutive times, a yellow star appears under the character. You may then attempt to use the special shot, which entails lining up with the ball just right - but a failed special shot doesn't erase the stored potential.</desc>

    <desc>Theme Hospital is a level-based hospital management simulation where players have to start on an empty building, and then assemble rooms with all kinds of material, from desks and file cabinets for the general diagnosis to the expensive ultra-scanners and x-rays to diagnose such bizarre diseases such as Bloaty Head, Slack Songue or Alien DNA, and treat them with with even more bizarre machines like an Head Inflator or a DNA fixer. There several additional rooms, such as a staff room for your employees to rest, a toilet so that patients don't have to relieve themselves in the corridors, a research department to get the most advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies and a training room where consultants can teach a thing or two to rookies, making them capable doctors. The size and layout of each room can be set by the player, according to the available space. In addition to rooms, the player must provide radiators, seating for patients and drink machines.

However, rooms don't run by themselves. Most diagnostic and clinics can work with regular doctors, but others like the operating theater and the research room require specialized staff while the ward, pharmacy and the fracture clinic require an attending nurse. At the same time, the hospital can't run without handymen cruising around the hospital to water up dry plants, clean up litter and vomit (after all, people go there because they are sick) and fix machines, while receptionists direct patients to the proper rooms.</desc>

Once enough money has been made the player can move on to newer plots. Plots are located all over the world and have many different factors that affect gameplay, including the economy, weather, terrain and land value.

There are over thirty attractions available in the game. Depending on the platform, it is possible to tour the park or the rides. There are simple rides like the bouncy castle and tree house, and more complicated and expensive rides like the roller coaster and the Ferris wheel.</desc>

There are two types of courses; circuits offer demanding hilly terrains which can easily trash the vehicle and must be learned intimately. Endurance courses offer greater freedom, with the aim of finding the best route to link eight dispersed checkpoints.

To avoid any disorientation, arrows guide you to the next marker. Each area, be it snowy or volcanic, has characteristic features and hazards, yet this doesn't stop a repetitive feel developing. The third option is a fun mode, and one you might expect from the developer of Destruction Derby. Players have sixty seconds to take their truck on a car smashing spree.</desc>

The sentient Tiny Tank was originally created to appease a public that feared the mindless violence waged by larger war-robots, but he was soon destroyed by one of those jealous automatons at the beginning of the robot revolution 100 years ago. Almost destroyed, at least.

Thanks to nano-technology, hundreds of microscopic "Fix-It Crabs" went to work and Tiny Tank was slowly rebuilt. Now he alone stands against the threat of the cruel MuTank and his deadly robot minions, who have all but erased human civilization from the planet's surface. The spunky little tank will need luck, strategy, and all the futuristic firepower he can get his treads on to save the human race.</desc>

    <desc>Players head out for an adventure with the Tiny Toons gang in Tiny Toon Adventures: Plucky's Big Adventure for PlayStation. In this title, based on the Tiny Toons animated series kids can play as Plucky, Hamton, Buster and Babs as they explore twenty-plus levels of Acme Looniversity in search of parts for a time machine for Plucky. While avoiding the incorrigible Elmyra and Montana Max, players help the gang seek out the time machine parts in order for Plucky to travel back in time to finish his homework.

Searching all over the Looniversity in Acme Acres, players explore many places including the music room, history room, tennis courts and hallways. Items will vary from a bicycle pump to a potato and once an item is found, players can proceed with the level or return to the controlling character's respective locker to store the item. Each character can carry only three items at one time and players must decide which items are the most useful for each current level. Certain items are not time machine parts but rather will be used to acquire parts later in the game.</desc>

As Jerry continues to set traps in one half of the split screen, players can watch the results in the other half of the screen as Tom falls victim to (or outsmarts) the traps that have already been set. If Jerry notices that Tom seems to be getting a little too close for comfort, he can also blow his dog whistle and Spike will come to chase after Tom and even the odds a bit.

When two people play at once, one can take on the role of Tom and help him to avoid the traps that Jerry sets. The game features 15 different rooms to explore, each with its own challenges and rewards, and each successive level unlocks a new room in the house with more weapons scattered throughout. While most of the challenges involve reducing the other player's health first, some levels require rubber duckies be collected and placed in a pond. The first player to collect the required amount wins the match.</desc>

The game is presented in third person perspective. Lara is always visible and the camera follows the action from behind or over her shoulder. The world she inhabits is fully drawn in three dimensions and characterized by its cubic nature. Ledges, walls and ceilings mostly sit at 90 degrees to each other, but sometimes feature sloping planes.
The object of Tomb Raider is to guide Lara through a series of tombs and other locations in search of treasures and artefacts. On the way, she must kill dangerous animals and other creatures, while collecting objects and solving puzzles to gain access to an ultimate prize, usually a powerful artefact. Gunplay is restricted to the killing of various animals that appear throughout each stage, although occasionally Lara may be faced with a human opponent. Instead the emphasis lies on solving puzzles and performing trick jumps to complete each level.</desc>

Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact.

Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills.

    <desc>In the Prologue, millions of years ago, a meteor struck the then tropical environments of Antarctica. It was first discovered by a tribe of ancient Polynesians who settled there and constructed a city in the meteorite crater. They worshipped the immense supernatural powers it appeared to hold, fashioning four artefacts out of the meteorite's core material (which become the focus of the game). Shortly thereafter, the tribe laid witness to the deformed birth of their prophesied leader, born without a face, and fled Antarctica in fear of what the meteorite was capable of. In the present day, the ancient Polynesian city has been buried beneath snow and ice and RX Tech are excavating the site, investigating the meteorite. Led by Dr. Willard, the crew discovers remnants of the Polynesian city, ancient stone statues resembling the Easter Island Moai, and finds the grave of a man named Paul Caulfield of the HMS Beagle.

When the game begins, Lara Croft is in India searching for a legendary stone in the ruins of an ancient temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. She encounters Tony, an RX Tech employee who seems to be suffering from a severe bout of jungle fever. After parting ways, Tony remains one step ahead of Lara in their search for the stone, eventually finding it hidden deep within an underground cavern. After killing an oddly superhuman Tony, Lara takes the stone and exits. On her trek back to the Indian jungle, she is discovered by Dr. Willard.</desc>

    <desc>Tonka Space Station features nine different arcade-style games, each covering a different part of life on a space station, from gathering food to fighting off rogue asteroids. Each challenge also features a different Tonka vehicle to help you complete your task, such as driving the TEV (the Tonkonium Extraction Vehicle) with the front mounted drill or speeding through space in a space ship.

The game not only provides arcade action but also teaches the responsibilities associated with running a space station. You start off with a small group of people, and with careful management you can watch your population grow. You can monitor their happiness levels, as well as how productive they are. Remember, these people are counting on you.

So team up with Tonka Joe and see if you have what it takes to build a successful space station. Are you the person for the job?</desc>

With money gained, the player can then purchase skill improvements and better skateboards. THPS2 was also the first game in the series to introduce the manual, a skateboarding trick where the performer balances on two wheels. This enables players to string together trick combos. The game also introduced the Noseslide, Tailslide, Bluntslide, Nosebluntside, Feeble, and Overcrook grinds. It was also the first of the Pro Skater games to feature Create-a-Skater and Park Editor features, now staples in the series.</desc>

    <desc>With this release of Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3, one of the most universally popular and financially successful game franchises in recent memory returns home to roost on the original PlayStation console that launched the peerless extreme sports series in the autumn of 1999. Though this third version of the title is being released on half a dozen platforms and considerable effort has been invested in assuring that the PS2, Xbox, and GameCube versions of the live up to their "next-generation" technological potential, Neversoft and Activision endeavored to bless this PS version with all of the third edition's key innovations while retaining and reinforcing the engaging, accessible gameplay which is the true crux of the series' success.

While it can't pump out the same amount of eye-candy as its counterparts on the 128-bit generation systems, this PlayStation release of THPS3 incorporates several of the new features designed to propel the series' popularity on other platforms. New landing tricks allow players to string together greater combinations, especially when moving from the ramps to the street. Environments are designed to test old and new skills alike. Loyal PS gamers should be pleased that all the important new levels, tricks, and combinations developed for the third edition of Tony Hawk Pro Skater are duly represented in this version of the game.</desc>

    <desc>The fourth game in Activision and Neversoft's seminal skateboarding series is designed to bring additions and refinements to the already polished gameplay that's made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater one of the most important video game franchises of its time. Many of these improvements are in line with advances made in earlier THPS sequels, while others may come as a surprise to longtime fans of the series.

Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The "spine transfer" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other. Players will trick off of moving cars and other interactive elements of the game's diverse levels with new finesse.</desc>

The game was copyrighted in 1993 but not made available to the public until January 1994, leading some sources to mistakenly list its release date as 1993. A sequel, Solar Eclipse, was released exclusively for the Sega Saturn.

In Total Eclipse Turbo, gamers must defend Earth's sun from an invading band of baddies knows as the Dras-sai. To be successful in your mission, players must navigate their character through four objective and 20 rounds of alien annihilating action. Players may blast on the enemy aliens with weapons including plasma bombs and a handful of blasters.</desc>

There are dozens of hidden goodies to be discovered in the PlayStation version of this title that aren't in the N64 take, and the graphics make the most of the PSX's capacity.

The game takes place over 14 diverse underwater locations, ranging from the Bermuda Triangle to Antarctica. The levels are designed to evoke a claustrophobic and moody environment. The game's soundtrack was composed by award winning video game composer Tommy Tallarico. There is one unlockable 'bonus' level, Atlantis.

    <desc>Electronic Arts' fourth baseball game on PlayStation features 30 authentic Major League Baseball teams and over 700 players with ratings based on the 1998 season. Four game modes include "Single Game," "Home Run Challenge," "Season," and "Playoffs." All 30 ballparks have been modeled after their real-life counterparts, and games can be played at night, dusk, or during the day. In-game commentary is provided by Buck Martinez and Jim Hughson.

Two viewpoints are available during the game: batting from the catcher's perspective and fielding from a view above the diamond or outfield. Both offer three camera angles to further customize the perspective. Also featured is an "action" camera that shows TV-style cut-scenes while the ball is in play. Team management options include trades, substitutions, custom players, free agents, adjustable rotations or lineups, and multiple defensive formations. The PlayStation version adds a fantasy draft option not available in the Nintendo 64 game.</desc>

As in previous versions, all the major league teams and their players are present along with all 30 big league parks, each recreated using real-time lighting and enhanced sounds; new stadiums such as San Francisco's Pac Bell Park are there too.

Every player is also modeled as closely as possible after their real life counterpart, even down to their own batting stances and pitching styles. Brand new animations such as arguments with umpires, high-fives, end-of-game celebrations and player reactions to strikeouts and homers also help bring the game to life.

Gamers who really want to immerse themselves in the experience can try out the brand new Behind the Fielder view. Now they can put themselves in the shoes of a fielder and see how easy it is to snare a line drive or scoop up a tough grounder. Perhaps they'll even stop yelling during real games every time the home team makes an error.

As an added bonus, EA has secured exclusive rights to the 500 Home Run Club, which means that gamers can step up to the plate as Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron or others, and take on today's top pitchers like Pedro Martinez or Randy Johnson. In addition, EA has exclusive rights to the MLBPA Big League Challenge, which is set in Las Vegas' Cashman Field. Big League Challenge Mode features 12 ballplayers from among the greatest of all time new and old in a variety of competitions such as a home run contest and target hitting (Extreme mode).</desc>

    <desc>While the old adage that "turnabout is fair play" applies in many situations, Natsume's Turnabout is all about diabolical puzzles where players rotate the entire puzzle while the pieces move within its borders, sliding and rolling into mind-numbing configurations and patterns. The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially.

Puzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen "steps," even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit Mode.</desc>

    <desc>The Ultimate Fighting Championship tournaments started in the 1990s, giving martial artists of the world a chance to distinguish themselves in a fighting environment with very few rules. Fighters could be matched up against fighters of any style, and the match ended only when one fighter submitted.

The popularity of the sport resulted in the creation of other mixed martial arts tournaments and the evolution and merging of fighting styles for greater effectiveness. Ultimate Fighting Championship is a 3D fighting game that tries to simulate the experience of a real mixed martial arts fight. Players can choose from a selection of established UFC fighters, or create their own fighter through the Career Mode.

While in Career Mode, players start the character creation process by selecting from several style templates, then using points earned through fighting and beating a series of progressively more difficult fighters to buy attribute upgrades in stamina, endurance, punching ability, kicking ability, or to learn certain techniques.</desc>

    <desc>A war has been going on for nearly two hundred years between the cruel Imperium regime and the Rebel forces. The Rebels are beginning to turn the tides of the war to their advantage, and while the Imperium armies are by no means defeated, there is a great deal of hope in the Rebel camp.

Unfortunately, the Imperium has introduced a new weapon of unspeakable power. When unleashed against a Rebel planet, the damage was absolute. This new "planet-killing" weapon will certainly mark the end of the Rebel forces if it continues to operate.

Uprising X, by The 3DO Company, is a blend of action and strategy for the PlayStation. Players take control of a tank-like vehicle known as "The Wraith," which is the most powerful weapon available to the Rebel forces. The majority of the game is spent behind the controls of the Wraith, although some missions will require troop deployment and the construction of Rebel equipment. The game utilizes a first-person view from inside the Wraith or while building in Citadel mode.</desc>

    <desc>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series.

Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch.

The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers. Caused by a chain of coincidences, the young boy Joshua, from a small and unimportant village in the east, eventually finds himself within a complex political scheme set in motion by power-hungry aristocrats and religious fanatics.</desc>

    <desc>Vanishing Point is an arcade-style racing game that revolves around unlocking cars and tracks by progressing through tournament heats. As the game begins, the only available cars are a Ford Mustang Cobra SVT or Ford Explorer, and there's only one track on which to race. But earning first-place finishes unlocks additional tracks, cars like the Audi TT, BMW 325i and Dodge Viper GTS, and extra features such as the Tune-Up Shop.

The other major feature of the game is Stunt Driver mode, which consists of a series of timed challenges like jumps and slalom courses. The faster you complete each challenge, the most stunt points you receive to go towards unlocking additional stunts. Single Race and Time Trial modes are also available.

The only initially playable two-player mode is Single Race, but two additional challenges called Balloon Buster and Chicken can be unlocked. Balloon Buster has you racing on a track filled with colored balloons. Popping balloons of your color subtracts a second from your time, while popping an opponent's adds two seconds. Chicken pits two racers on a track going in opposite directions.</desc>

Each game features actual Vegas rulings and regulations to further enhance the virtual casino experience. For instance, the longer you play a certain slot machine and pump more and more tokens in, the higher it's jackpot becomes -- just like real slots.</desc>

    <desc>Viewpoint is an arcade isometric shooter, released in 1992 by SNK for the Neo-Geo arcade platform. By default, 1P and 2P can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled.

The Sony PlayStation version, developed by Visual Concepts, featured re-done visuals and sound while the gameplay itself remains true to the original game with level layouts and boss/enemy patterns remaining the same.

Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.</desc>

    <desc>Players do combat over a number of stages located all over the western United States, whether in Story or Arcade Mode. Each stage has interactive features, such as ballistic missiles and launching Aurora planes for the Area 51 level. Every vehicle is equipped with a machine gun by default, but up to three out of five available weapons - mines, autocannons, rocket pods, mortars, and homing missiles, plus a special weapon unique to the vehicle - can be installed. Two types of special attacks can be made using each of the five standard weapons, at a bigger cost in ammunition, by performing fighting game-style movements and button presses on the control pad. These attacks can be performed to eliminate nearly-destroyed cars in a method called "Totaling." The player can also score up to six combo hits called Whammies. Special icons can also be picked up such as wrenches to repair damage and yellow zigzag lines to temporarily jam the opponent's homing-based weapons. Certain objectives in Story Mode must be completed to help unlock the game's secret characters and stages. The game also offers players the option to play standard music CDs during a match.</desc>

    <desc>As in Vigilante 8, players will control a vehicle and eliminate all other vehicles in the arena with the use of weapons and upgrades. The player can choose to play through a story mode, Quest Mode, or play with an assorted number of bots in Arcade mode. The game also offers a new two-player cooperative mode and a Grand Melee Deathmatch mode, wherein the player endures attacks by multiple AI opponents. Second Offense introduced the "Salvage Points" system, which allows the player to upgrade their vehicle by collecting Salvage Points from destroyed opponents, improving the vehicle's offense, defense, speed, and targeting abilities. The vehicle's external appearance also improves with more Salvage Points and turns into a totally different design when it is fully upgraded. Special icons scattered over the game zone allows the player to improve mobility over certain environments, such as hover pods, skis, and outboard motors. The original game's five standard weapons - mines, rockets, autocannons, homing missiles, and mortars - are now supplanted by flamethrowers, with each weapon now capable of performing three special attacks using movements on the control pad. The Totaling and Whammy combat modes from the first game are also retained, as is the concept of stages with interactive features.</desc>

    <desc>Warcraft II: The Dark Saga brings the successful Warcraft series to the console world, delivering medieval orc vs. human combat to those that haven't been able to enjoy the PC version. Warcraft II is a real-time strategy game that requires players to build up orc and human forces by building structures and creating units for combat. The main objective is to take control of one race and wipe the other one completely off of the map.

The console version of Warcraft II sports some changes from its PC predecessor. First and foremost, both the original version of Warcraft II as well as the expansion pack are included. This means twice as many maps and four separate campaigns, giving players 52 different missions split between the races. Other additions include six new full-motion video cut-scenes, and the ability to group sixteen units instead of nine. Also included are extra production options, meaning that if you control multiple bases, it will be easier to maintain one while focusing your attention on the other.</desc>

In order to save campaign progress, players must have a memory card with at least one block free.

Battles consist of two phases: deployment and real-time fighting. Deployment allows you to position your regiments within an area designated by white flags. This involves turning them to face certain enemies, issuing orders to attack, move (including setting waypoints and patrol loops) or simply hold ground.

Combat involves charging the enemy, using magical spells (if available) or firing long-range weapons, such as arrows or catapults. Of course, line of sight and terrain will influence how successful your attacks are, and the emotion level (fear, hatred or frenzy) as well as the experience of your troops will also play a significant role. Each battlefield can also hold various magic items that may help in future battles.</desc>

    <desc>Warzone 2100 is a real-time strategy game where you must plan, design and implement a number of factors in order to complete missions. You must begin by setting up a base camp and clearing away any scavenger groups within the vicinity. You start with a small force of troops that must be commanded to fight attacking forces and build the base camp. Oil derricks must be constructed in order to extract oil, which is your main source of energy. Power generators must also be built to convert the oil into power. This power is used to run the rest of your base camp, which can consist of command centers, research facilities, factories and other military structures.

After your base camp is established you must send troops out into the wasteland to recover artifacts, discover more oil pools and raid enemy strongholds. It is vitally important to recover artifacts because these are the source of new technologies. Artifacts must be studied at your research facility before the new technology can be implemented. The new technology can be used to design and manufacture new weapons and vehicles. There are over 2,000 units that can be designed in Warzone 2100. All missions are timed, so you must think and act quickly or you could risk losing the new technology to those who wish to use it for evil means.</desc>

    <desc>Gameplay consists of two basic options: Arcade and Simulation. Although the graphics and earlobe vary little between the two, other changes have the effect of changing the chemistry and intensity of gameplay between the two options. The gamer has the ability to customize period length, fatigue (on/off), line changes, fighting (on/off), penalties (simulation only), rink size (arcade only), puck-streak (on/off), and camera angle.

Simulation Mode:
Simulation mode is designed to emulate the real game of hockey. Players may play five, four, or three to a side, depending on preference. Recognition of penalties, off-sides, and icing are all optional, but two-line pass is not considered. Period length can be selected between 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes.

Arcade Mode:
During the Arcade mode checking, hooking, and tripping are more violent. Fights occur with greater frequency, and penalties are disregarded entirely. Additionally, arcade mode sees the introduction of a "power shot", which a player may utilize to light the net on fire after a goal. Arcade mode tends to be more exciting.</desc>

    <desc>The famous wheel finally spins its way onto the PlayStation in this translation of the hit television game show. Wheel of Fortune features video clips and speech of host Vanna White (Pat Sajak is not included) as up to three players compete for cash and prizes. Games can be customized to last 15 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, or between three to five rounds. A new twist comes in the form of the Solo Game, which allows you the chance to play without other contestants stealing your thunder.

The catch is that you only have eight turns before the game ends. For every incorrect guess, bankrupt or lose-a-turn space you land on, you're forced to use one of your remaining free spins.</desc>

    <desc>Trivia buffs and Regis Philbin fans unite -- you can now play the popular ABC game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire on your PlayStation console. Who Wants to be a Millionaire - 2nd Edition features 600 new questions and more smarmy commentary from the suave, aforementioned host.

If you have been living under an Atari 2600 and are new to the Millionaire phenomena, you should know that players sitting in the hot seat must answer 15 multiple choice questions in order to win $1,000,000. If you want a chance at a cool million in the two-player mode of this game show simulation, you must first win a fastest finger contest in which you place items (such as films or states) in their proper order.

Once you take the hot seat, Regis Philbin will give you a question with four possible answers. Answer it correctly (within the 30-second time limit) and you will win $100. Each ensuing question promises a bigger payoff. The questions start off relatively simple and get progressively more difficult as you work your way up the monetary ladder.</desc>

    <desc>Wex Major is a teenager from Earth whose parents were kidnapped by aliens. Traveling through space, Wex comes into contact with a powerful weapon system known as The Rig. Apparently the young boy is the only one who can harness the power of The Rig, and he is proclaimed The Great Champion, a legendary leader who can rid the oppressed people of the Andromeda Galaxy from the tyranny of the evil gigantic monster named Karn. Wex recruits other teenage mutants and becomes the leader of Wild 9, an organization that aims to overthrow Karn and liberate the galaxy.

Wild 9 is a 2D platformer with 3D graphics, featuring gameplay similar in vein to the company's Earthworm Jim games. Unique to the game is the The Rig, a weapon the protagonist wields. The Rig functions like an electronic lasso, capable of moving objects as well as carry around and smash enemies, which is often needed to solve puzzles and progress through the game's ten levels. A few stages focus on avoiding obstacles and taking on boss enemies.</desc>

Of the six games in this collection, Bubbles is by far the most obscure and was the least successful commercially in the arcades.</desc>

    <desc>The protagonist of the previous two games was officially assigned a name in WCIII, Colonel Christopher Blair (Mark Hamill). The opening cutscene, the first FMV cutscene in the Wing Commander series, depicts a saddening scene: Thrakhath nar Kiranka (John Rhys-Davies), Crown Prince of the hostile Kilrathi Empire, presiding over the execution by disintegration of a group of Terran Confederation prisoners of war. One, however, is left alive: Blair's lover Colonel Jeannette "Angel" Devereaux (Yolanda Jilot), due to her status among the Kilrathi as a respected warrior, who is executed by Prince Thrakhath using his claws to disembowel her (though her death scene is not shown until later in the game). The scene then cuts to the planet Vespus, where Blair and Brigadier General James "Paladin" Taggart inspect the downed wreckage of the TCS Concordia. The carrier is a total loss.

The year is 2669. After four decades, a war spanning the universe has still been going on between the Terran Confederates, and the Kilrathi, causing millions of casualties on each side. You are Colonel Christopher Blair; a veteran of the Confederate Space Force, who has just been relocated to the TCS Victory. You will lead a group of young men and women to the very forefront of this war and to the final battle at either Kilrath or Earth. Where? You decide.</desc>

    <desc>Wipeout 3 is a racing game that retains the same basic elements of its predecessors, and introduces players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League. Players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits. Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane that is set apart from the main course. The less time spent in the pit lane, the less the shield will regenerate.

In addition to shields, each racing craft contains air brakes for navigating tight corners, as well as a "hyper-boost" option. Players can activate the hyper-boost to increase their speed, but the boost drains energy from the shields, making the craft more vulnerable. Using special speed pads on the course allows players to increase their speed without resorting to the boost.</desc>

    <desc>World Destruction League - Thunder Tanks is a post-apocalyptic demolition derby, disguised as a sport dedicated to organizing exciting tank battles all over the planet. It's 2062 and the biggest TV show in history is about to broadcast nine of the best monster tank competitors, each with their own unique tank, battling for supremacy in Tournament mode or one of four Skirmish gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Frenzy, and Family. Multiplayer action allows two human players to go head-to-head with up to three additional computer-controlled players per team in split-screen mayhem.

Features include continuations from a memory card or via input codes received at the end of each level, six control configurations, and three unmanned "drone" tanks to mix up the action. Vehicle enhancements run the gamut from guided missiles, shock rings, plasma bolts, shields, laser cannons, grenade launchers, teleporters, and mines to power-ups of health, nukes, ammunition, auto-fire, repairs, radar, and more. AI opponent strength can be set to easy, normal, or hard, and auto-cannons or drones can be turned off in Skirmish mode. Campaign mode consists of 12 rounds, and games are "broadcast" by two wacky commentators.</desc>

    <desc>Worms is a turn-based strategy game. It features up to 4 teams of 4 worms, aiming to destroy the others on a generated terrain. Each worm has 100 hit points, and dies when his hit points fall to 0. Upon death, a worm explodes, causing damage to everyone around.

Gameplay is turn-based. Each turn, the player can control one specific worm from his team. The worm can crawl left and right or jump. However, there is a time limit to make a move; also, if the worm falls from a great height, it loses health and the turn ends immediately; and if a worm falls into water or offscreen, it dies. Each turn, a worm can also make a single attack: the player can aim up and down, choose a weapon and then fire it. After attacking, the turn ends.</desc>

Worms can walk and jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives (such as collecting a specific crate).</desc>

    <name>Worms World Party</name>
    <desc>Worms World Party is an artillery game, which is a type of Turn-based strategy game. Like its predecessors, Worms World Party involves controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.</desc>

    <desc>X-COM: UFO Defense is based on the 1994 PC game originally developed by Mythos Games Ltd. The player assumes control of the X-COM task force, building bases and tracking various UFOs on a 3D map of Earth. Once a UFO is spotted (represented by a red cross), you must try to intercept it so that it crashes over dry land. You'll then need to send your heavily armed squad to the site, where you'll witness the downed craft and surrounding terrain from an isometric perspective.

Moving your troops is accomplished through a point-and-click interface with each side alternating turns. Your three goals are to (1) engage the aliens face to face, (2) either stun or kill them, and (3) retrieve whatever technology or weapons you find so your scientists can replicate them. After all, you have to fight fire with fire! The PlayStation version supports both the mouse and memory card, with the latter allowing you to save the game at any point (as long as you have five blocks free).</desc>

    <name>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</name>
    <desc>X-Men vs. Street Fighter is a fighting game originally released as a coin-operated arcade game in 1996. It is Capcom's third fighting game to feature Marvel Comics characters and the first game to match them against their own, with characters from Marvel's X-Men franchise being matched against the cast from the Street Fighter series.

It was the first game to blend a tag team style of combat with the Street Fighter gameplay, as well as incorporating elements from Capcom's previous Marvel-themed fighting games, X-Men: Children of the Atom and Marvel Super Heroes. It was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1997 and PlayStation in 1998. However, the tag team feature was omitted from the PlayStation version due to memory limitations.</desc>

    <desc>American football is a sport played between two teams of eleven with the objective of scoring points by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone. Known in the United States simply as football, it may also be referred to informally as gridiron football, and even more rare, the "pigskin". The ball can be advanced by running with it or throwing it to a teammate. Points can be scored by carrying the ball over the opponent's goal line, catching a pass thrown over that goal line, kicking the ball through the opponent's goal posts or tackling an opposing ball carrier in his own end zone.
