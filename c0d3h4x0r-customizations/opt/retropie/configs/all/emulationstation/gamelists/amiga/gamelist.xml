		<desc>As a 19th century merchant newcomer, the player needs to buy a ship, find a crew, load a few goods on the ship, and sail into the horizon, until the player reaches a port with a demand for said goods. The next step is to expand by buying more ships, creating regular trade routes, and becoming the head of a regular trading company.
1869 focuses on management and economy, rather than action. Actual sailing is done by plotting a route and then watching the days go by, interrupted only by the occasional random event. Basically the main activities are planning routes, watching out for special assignments (that pay well if completed on time) and generally trying to steer clear of the shores of bankruptcy.</desc>

Updates to the gameplay include an energy bar, which can be run down by either being hit from incoming fire or using a special weapon. The energy bar can be replenished by picking up power-ups, while special weapons (lightning, cyclones and waves) can knock down all fighters on the screen at the time.</desc>

		<desc>In 3001: O'Connors Fight, the player takes the role of John O'Connor, one of six space lords which fight for dominance over the space empire. The main playing menu consists of two parts: the space map with all planets (either in animated 3D or a top-down view) and the menu with up to four commands. The basic gist is that the lords need to visit owned planets in order to adjust their production focus: space ships are used to defend planets and fuel is required to move them around the empire.

More planets are acquired by attacking them. The result is calculated automatically and is based on the amount of defending respectively attacking troops. A special case comes into effect when a space lord is currently on the attacked planet: the winner of the fight instantly receives all the loser's planets. A lord is permanently removed from the game after the second personal defeat; the goal is to unite all planets under O'Connor's rule. Sometimes there is an action sequence in which the player has to move the space ship (by clicking on cursor keys) in order to avoid obstacles.</desc>

		<desc>3D Construction Kit (US, Canada and Israel release title: Virtual Reality Studio[4]), also known as 3D Virtual Studio, is a utility for creating 3D worlds in Freescape. Developed by Incentive Software and published by Domark, it was released in 1991 on multiple platforms. The game originally retailed for &#xC2;&#xA3;24.99 for the 8-bit version, and &#xC2;&#xA3;49.99 for 16-bit version, in the United Kingdom. A sequel, 3D Construction Kit II, was released in 1992, but only available on Amiga, Atari ST or IBM PC (DOS).

Incentive Software had released games using the Freescape engine before, but with 3D Construction Kit, the company took the concept to a whole new level, giving users the ability to create their own worlds and games. In 3D Construction Kit, interaction with the world is usually limited to a cursor controlled with the keyboard, offering the possibility of interaction with nearby objects.

The kit has a very simple graphical user interface, allowing users to create and manipulate objects within the game's 3D environment. Primitives such as cubes, cuboids and pyramids can be easily created and edited to be scaled and placed on the 3D world. Colours can be selected for individual elements, making the free roaming worlds more varied and complex. The user-created virtual world is divided into areas, reducing the processing power required to render objects. The areas can be as large as the memory allows.

Animations may also be added to the primitives, either by looping or simple moving attributes to objects, to create simple, although seemingly advanced, animations.

In order to make games rather than worlds, 3D Construction Kit also allows for the addition of conditions, using the very simple-to-program Freescape Command Language (FCL). Sensors, animations and interactivity with the elements can be added with relative ease. Players are able to move around the virtual worlds by walking or flying. Elements such as proximity sensors triggering events, enemies making the player appear in another zone of the game when hit, and the ability to activate switches in order to open doors, make the worlds created with 3D Construction Kit come to life and add a level of uncertainty to the gameplay.

The interface of the game is customisable; by adding a 320x200, 16-colour IFF screen created with any image editing program, the games created with this tool could be made to look more professional.</desc>

		<desc>4-D Boxing leaves behind any pretences of being a pure arcade game based on boxing, and aims to recreate the sport in full detail. The graphics engine allows for multiple camera angles and viewpoints, and considerably detailed visuals. These required more advanced hardware than was common at the time, but a stick-figure mode was included as a compromise. The moves on offer include all the uppercuts and hooks of a real fight, and the players are designed to move realistically to implement them.

You progress through the game by taking on a succession of increasingly difficult fighters, and get to train your boxer in between. Advanced action replays are included as well, so you can review all that happened.</desc>

		<desc>Like other sports games by Bob Whitehead, 4th &amp; Inches was hailed upon release, combining the action of previous titles with the new feature of strategic play calling. For the first time in a computer football game, players could choose from a number of plays. The player initially designated a formation, and then selected one of five plays based on the formation. These plays included a great number of offensive strategies, including draws, curls, sweeps and long bombs, among others. Defensive tactics equally were varied, with the player being able to choose a defensive formation based on what they thought the opponent would attempt.



The game required the player to select a position to control before the play began while on offense, but were not able to switch control during the action. Because there was a limited area of the field in view at any one time, it occasionally prevented the player from seeing important parts of the play develop. Rather than scrolling smoothly when the player being controlled would reach the edge of the screen, as modern football simulations do, it re-drew the visible section of the field entirely, placing the controlled player in a new position on the screen. While on defense, the player being controlled could not be changed either, but would be automatically selected as the player closest to the offensive ball carrier on each screen redraw.</desc>

		<desc>The color chosen is locked for the opponent for one turn; drawing lines from one border of the field to another fills all the space in between. In addition, boards come in various diamond sizes, color textures and with obstacle stones. A (generous) time limit exerts soft pressure.

In the wake of Alexey Pajitnov's block-busting Tetris, Infogrames licensed another Russian mathematician's concept for a game of logics and dexterity: Two players start from opposite ends of a board, filled with rectangles of seven different colors, and take turns in picking one of these colors. All diamonds of that color bordering on the player's territory are annexed, expanding the borders. Whoever first controls more than half of the terrain wins.</desc>

		<desc>Claudette the cat has been kidnapped by scientists aiming to use her for experiments. Bob Cat can't allow this, and sets off to save her.

9 Lives is a platform game taking in four levels. The lengths of jumps are variable, depending on how long the joystick is pushed down for. Bonus items to be collected include rotor blades, to allow flight. 

Bob cannot kill his enemies, but can temporarily stun them, by hurling his ball of string at them. Contact with enemies or hazards causes an energy bar to decrease - a life is lost once it reaches zero. As the title suggests, this can happen eight times before a ninth death ends the game.

		<desc>This simulation puts you in the cockpit of the A-10 Thunderbolt II, which is also known as the "Warthog". As the game's name implies, it is used mainly to hunt enemy tanks, but also for destroying roads and bridges

You are armed with 30mm Avenger cannon which can fire around 70 times a second. Multiple camera angles are featured. Landing is automated and an accelerated time function is on offer.

Characters have full AI to act without your involvement, and will communicate with you in-flight. Actions in one mission affect another - something you failed to destroy in one mission can attack you later.</desc>

		<desc>Play the part of the head of a railroad company, with the aim of creating a railroad empire, providing a successful mass transit system that will be an inspiration to the rest of the world. Another goal is to provide the impetus for a chosen city to develop. There are a number of different places to set up business each with different layouts and existing houses and businesses.

The main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for commuter trains.

As the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. The player may also build own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors.

The stock market is also another way of making money. The player may also watch the seasons come and go, with snow visible in winter, and fireworks displays celebrating the New Year.</desc>

		<desc>In this RPG, you play the role of four heroes whose mission is to save their world, Kalynthia, from the evil arch mage Bronagh. Most of the time, while exploring the over world, the game is shown in a 2D top-down view. It gives you much freedom: there's more to do than just stick to the main quest. Towns have a static interface where you reach the wished location by pressing the according symbol. e.g. a church for healing up or a sage for hints.

During dungeon crawls the game switches to a 3D view and plays similar to Dungeon Master. As usual for this kind of games you see the dungeon in a small windows while your characters are shown on the right hand side of the screen. Dungeon sequences are completely in real-time. This includes combat which basically consists of clicking on a character's weapon or magic spell and then clicking on the monster. After every usage of a weapon/spell you have to wait a certain time until you can use it again.</desc>

		<desc>In this dungeon-crawling RPG you must assemble a team of four brave fighters to launch an attack on Pendugmalhe, and save the kingdom of Kalynthia. The main gameplay is influenced by Dungeon Master, but features sections in the open air battling bears as well as the dungeons.

In the real-time combat sections you must choose weapons and spells instantaneously, using the mouse-based interface. You will find many villages along the way, and you can gain clues and buy supplies at these. The game's difficulty is pitched at experienced role-players; ideally those with an experienced party from the first game to load in.</desc>

		<desc>Pete Cooke's follow-up to the previous space shooter-explorer takes things away from the Tau Ceti setting. Players take the role of a student at an academy for advanced piloting. There they need to solve 20 simulated missions on a wide range of planets.

The self-contained missions mean that the game uses the Tau Ceti structure and theme, without the causality of previous decisions having an effect on later choices. This reduces the complexity of management. Although players can customize the ships, including giving them names of your choice, the game comes with supplied ones include a variety that should suit many different circumstances.

Whichever vehicle is chosen, players will control it from a 1st person perspective and a series of controls. All ships skim over the surface of the planet and feature weapons. Most missions will involve destroying rogue robots enemies. Players will have to dock with buildings to refuel or move on to a different planet.</desc>

		<desc>This is a top down vertically scrolling shooter, in which you start off as a motorbike. You are quite vulnerable to attack at first, but power ups come in the form of a Sega van which you have to dock with. The first time you dock you get double fire, the second time gives you a rocket, the third gives a rear force field and the fourth invulnerablility.

By destroying cars and bikes that appear on your way, you can collect A-F letters. Collecting A through to D allows you change into a sportscar which is less vulnerable to attack, but not as nimble. Collect all the letters in order to be able to transform into a high tech plane. This is the final stage of one of the five missions. Only the high tech plane can guide you to your destination in which your main target is hiding.

There is also time limit in which you have to complete the mission. It is advisable to transform into the high tech plane as fast as it is possible.

Picking up flags gives you bonus points with 10,000 points gaining you an extra life.</desc>

		<desc>The War of the Lance is over, the dragon armies have been defeated. But evil has not left Krynn. In northeastern Ansalon, outposts of the Knights of Solamnia remain to guard the fragile peace. Your party of adventurers is hired to carry out missions for the Knights. On your first mission, you stumble upon Draconians, long believed to have left the area. What are their plans? On your travels you have to face dangers in many dungeons and towns and might even meet some of the legendary Heroes of the Lance.

Champions of Krynn is the first of SSI's "gold box" games set in the AD&amp;D world of Dragonlance, with all the usual features: first-person view and movement in dungeons, towns and outposts, overland travel on a map of the area and tactical turn-based combat from a top-down perspective.

As the first game set in Krynn, it has several features unique to that setting: In character races, one can choose from Kender, Silvanesti or Qualinesti Elves and Mountain or Hill Dwarves in addition to humans and half-elves. Special character classes include Solamnic Knights, clerics of the major deities of Krynn and mages of either the Red or the White Robe. The deities grant special spells and powers to their respective clerics. Red and White mages have access to different spells and the phases of the moons of Krynn affect their spellcasting abilities.</desc>

		<desc>The Addams Family is a platform game based on the characters and settings from the movie (which, in turn, is based on the famous 1960's television series, which in turn is based on Charles Addams cartoon of the same name, which was featured in the magazine, The New Yorker, in the 30's).

The game takes place towards the end of the movie: the Addams Family has been evicted from their home by a court order issued by a backstabbing attorney (there's one for the books), Tully Alford. Even worse, the other Addamses: Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Granny and Lurch have gone missing.

As Gomez, you must tour the Addams mansion in search of your lost family, battling out mysterious monsters and evading traps, and eventually face your nemesis, Tully.</desc>

So naturally the player participates with the goal to win the major league (there are overall three with increasing difficulties). The game itself is a bit like indoor soccer with four athletes (armed with guns) and on a smaller playing field with bumpers. A match lasts 120 seconds and there are various power-ups to collect. Each player only takes control over a single athlete. The sportsmen show up on the screen as balls.</desc>

		<desc>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance is a video game released in January 1988 for various home computer systems and consoles. The game is based on the first Dragonlance campaign module for the Dungeons &amp; Dragons fantasy role-playing game, Dragons of Despair, and the first Dragonlance novel Dragons of Autumn Twilight. Heroes of the Lance focuses on the journey of eight heroes through the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, where they must face the ancient dragon Khisanth and retrieve the relic, the Disks of Mishakal.

Heroes of the Lance is a side-scrolling action game. The game uses actual Dungeons &amp; Dragons statistics, with statistics for the characters exactly as they were in the rule books. Eight heroes from the Dragonlance novels series must be assembled for the quest, and only one is visible on the screen at a time; when one on-screen hero dies, the next in line appears.

While Heroes of the Lance is a faithful representation of the books it is based on, it was a departure from the usual role-playing video game style of most Dungeons &amp; Dragons games, with a gameplay interface which consists of using one character at a time in horizontally scrolling fighting. Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies but they merely act as "lives" for the player as in more traditional fighting games, removing one of the main strategies of role-playing games from the game.</desc>

		<desc>Located on the northern shore of the Moonsea in Forgotten Realms, Phlan was once a flourishing trade city. However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest.

Pool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one.

Exploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also "multi-class" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up.

The NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it. A randomly generated dungeon feature was also removed.</desc>

		<desc>The Adventures of Quik &amp; Silva is a platform video game originally released in 1991 for the Amiga. The game was developed by members of Factor 5 pseudonymously as New Bits On The RAM (presumably a play on New Kids on the Block), and was first published as a covermounted disk on Amiga Fun magazine. The game was later available in 1992 as public domain software, with the Amiga version reviewed in issue 18 of Amiga Power. This game is assumed to be the first appearance, albeit unlicensed, of Sonic the Hedgehog for a home games format. Additionally, the various enemies in the game are based on characters from other titles, such as Bubble Bobble, Nebulus, R-Type, and even Super Mario.</desc>

		<desc>In Robin Hood you must perform many heroic deeds to change the public impression of you from "villain" to "hero." To he ultimate aim is to retake your castle, which is captured in the intro sequence. This involves bringing together your band of merry men, and killing the Sheriff and his guards. There are around 6 extra items you can find in the game, most of which aren't essential but make the game a lot easier. The whole interface is similar to Populous: you don't direct Robin directly but with icons which are placed around the screen.</desc>

		<desc>Willy Beamish is a kid who likes to goof off and have fun. Naturally all the grown-ups get in the way by making him go to school, making him clean his room, etc. But now that's school's out for the summer, Willy is determined to have a good time and maybe even have his pet frog win the frog jumping contest. However Willy has a habit of getting into trouble, and naturally that means it will be a challenge to get out of it.

The Adventures of Willy Beamish is a point-and-click graphical adventure. You play Willy Beamish, an eight year-old kid who is just trying to get through life without losing his lunch money. But he'll have to deal with parents, teachers, babysitters and bratty sisters. The player must solve different puzzles to ensure Willy can progress, get out of trouble and generally avoid ending up grounded.

The in-game time progresses even if no action is taken. This means many puzzles have to be solved in a certain time frame or rely on being in the right place at the right time. A special aspect of this game is a bar which shows Willy's relationship to his parents. It gets affected by the way certain situations are resolved, e.g. it increases if Willy refuses to play with his sister, and when it is full they send Willy to a military school and the game is lost.</desc>

Don't mind the very mediocre graphics and laughable sounds, the gameplay is where this African adventure really gets lost. Half of the time you just don't know where your sand-buggy is going to, because the handling is pathetic. Try to stay between the barrels for longer than 10 seconds while driving at half speed... If you succeed, you're a real champ! Better still: don't even try and forget this game ever existed! Yes, do that instead, and you'll be a much happier person!</desc>

		<desc>Year 2019, Manhattan. After a nuclear war.

Out of the ashes comes a hero, Jonathan Rogers, better known as "Jungle Rogers", the owner of the asphalt jungle. The only chance of survival is to reach the airdrop platform XV-238, located in the control base of the schizophrenic assassin professor McJerin, and to escape to outer colonies.

There is no easy way to do this. The game is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up, with thugs coming at you constantly, and a few moves to use on them. You must cross the dangerous streets of Manhattan, which have become over-run by feral thieves. Later you await the guardians of the scientific complex of McJerin.</desc>

As a magician's apprentice, you have been turned into an owl to give you the best chance of destroying the many dark creatures to be faced, and thus discovering the secret of cosmic strength.

These dark creatures include piranhas, giant ants and mosquitoes. Extra weapons and invincibility periods can be collected. The technical details include 3 layers of multi-directional parallax scrolling, background animation, and different title and in-game music.</desc>

		<desc>You have been turned into a ball of air with a slow leak by an evil wizard. You must find the Spellbook and the ingredients for the spell. Without these, you will never turn back into a human again.

These items have to be collected in the maze which consists of 150 isometric rooms. These can be explored freely but sometimes you need to have special objects to proceed, e.g. a candle in dark rooms. The dangers consist mostly of sharp objects which can cause your ball to burst. Additionally you are on a timer because your balloon loses air constantly. But it can be refilled by using pumps which can be found in the maze - but you have to leave them in time or you explode because of overpressure.</desc>

		<desc>In this action/simulation game by Microprose the player takes the role of an U.S. Army airborne ranger. These Airborne rangers are dropped behind enemy lines by parachute to perform all kinds of dangerous missions. Gameplay consists of 3 phases:

    Reading the mission briefing and outfitting 3 supply pods with machine gun ammo, time bombs, first-aid kits, grenades &amp; LAW rockets depending on this briefing.
    Flying over the mission map in a V-22 Osprey plane to drop your 3 supply pods and parachuting out of the plane yourself.
    Performing the actual missions and reaching the pick-up point before time runs out. There are 12 different missions which include capturing an enemy officer, blowing up an ammunition depot, photographing an experimental aircraft and liberating P.O.W.'s

Missions take place in either an arctic, desert or temperate setting. Using the mission map the player must decide the route towards the mission objective. This might require them to crawl through trenches, run around minefields or take out enemy soldiers and bunkers. Airborne Ranger was one of the first games with some missions that required a stealthy approach (staying undetected until a certain time, taking out a guard and stealing an enemy uniform etc.).

Airborne Ranger can be played in practice or veteran mode. In practice mode, gameplay is limited to a single mission, while in veteran mode, a series of missions or an entire campaign is played in order to earn medals &amp; promotions. All missions can be played on several difficulty levels.</desc>

The Sultan's guards and also animals of the desert want to hinder Aladdin in his way. He can attack either close range with a scimitar, which can deflect certain projectiles, or long range with a limited supply of apples. Next to apples, Aladdin can also collect gems which can be traded for lives and continues from a traveling peddler. Finding Genie or Abu icons enables bonus rounds. The Genie bonus round is a game of luck played for apples, gems or extra lives, and continues until the player runs out of Genie tokens or lands on Jafar. In Abu's bonus round, the player controls the little monkey who has to catch bonus items that fall from the sky, but without touching any of the unwanted objects like rocks and pots.

		<desc>A drug baron took over Alcatraz prison and now the player takes the role of an U.S. Navy Seal to break in and neutralize him. He has two hours to complete his objectives in three buildings and needs to survive two different playing styles: side-scrolling fighting on the streets and first-person shooting inside.

Outside, the goal is to reach the building in which the objectives have to be completed. Of course the baron's thugs are not too pleased and try to kill the hero - so he has to shoot back with a many different weapons, e.g. flamethrowers, machine guns, bombs, and other destructive or close combat weapons, which can be collected from dead enemies. Similarly to Hostage: Rescue Mission, he can also hide in the background in certain spots.

Once inside a building, the game switches to a first-person view, in which the player has to navigate a maze to reach his goal, e.g. recovering evidence. To his disposal are a radar and a rifle.</desc>

The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

		<desc>Alfred the chicken must rescue his friends and his bird (pardon the pun) Floella from the Meka Chickens. The result is a platform game across differently-themed levels, which are finished by either climbing to the top of the level or killing a boss. Bonus games and secret rooms have been included, and progression sometimes requires solving positional puzzles.

Alfred cannot fly, but he can use ramps to jump up and hit enemies with his bionic beak - this kills them, but any other contact will hurt Alfred. Watch out for spiked snails though. Other enemies include whales armed with guns, and stray bombs.</desc>

		<desc>Aliantor is a Defender variant, but instead of side-scrolling in a 3D-environment. Besides the usual alien attack on a space station there is no background story. The player is cast as the only defender of the eight inhabitants and has to prevent them from being kidnapped by the aliens.

Each of the levels can be freely navigated (the ship's speed is automatically throttled when the invisible walls are reached) and the inhabitants stand around on pre-defined places. The aliens have various ship types with different behaviour patterns which either try to destroy the player's ship or collect the inhabitants and bring them into the aliens' invincible station. There they are transformed into especially powerful enemies (mutants). Besides the first-person view on environment, there are some instruments at the bottom of the screen, e.g. a list of present enemy types, a radar, speed, altitude or shield level. The latter represents the life energy and causes death when fully depleted. Additional lives are gained after earning enough points by shooting enemies. Besides dying, another way to lose the game is failing to keep at least one inhabitants alive.</desc>

		<desc>Alien&#xB3; is a video game based on the movie of the same name. The plot of the movie picks up directly after the end of Aliens. Ellen Ripley, the main character of the Alien series, is in cryo-sleep aboard the space ship Sulaco. Unfortunately, an alien or two has stowed away on the Sulaco, and wreaked havoc within the ship. Thus, it crash lands on the prison colony planet Fiorina 161. Ripley and the unarmed prisoners have to figure out a way to survive the aliens terrorizing the colony until help arrives.

The gameplay of the various Alien&#xB3; conversions varies from platform to platform. This version is a side-scrolling action game with large maze-like levels. In each level, you have to rescue all the trapped prisoners and then make your way to the exit, all while surviving multiple alien attacks.</desc>

		<desc>To be honest with you, Alien Bash is the sort of game that you can pick up and play without reading any instructions, it's that simple. Anyway, for those of you who are initiative-challenged will be pleased to know that the full instructions are coming up after this break.
Break.
Right, you play a nippy nameless young fellow who has to fend off hoards of alien scum-bag weakling no-brained slime-buckets using only your initiative. Oh, and a gun. By running around the spaceship (using the joystick) and avoiding anything which looks remotely harmless, you've got to free a set number of hostages from every level. These prisoners are encapsulated inside a lethal force-field which needs to be blasted away before you can run in and collect the stranded bods. Once you've managed to free all the prisoners in the level, make your way back to where you started from and you'll be whisked away to the next challenge.
Before you rush off and begin to blast things willy-nilly, it's worth mentioning that you cannot fire unless the joystick is pointing in one of the eight directions, so you either have to run towards the alien scumbag weakling no-brained slime-buckets whilst firing or centre the joystick, push FIRE and then move the joystick in whichever direction you wish to shoot.
There are simply loads of power-ups (revealed by destroying the funny looking shapes) to collect along the way, which vary from triple shot to super-hard death-inducing missiles which wipeout aliens with one hit. Brilliant! Also, there's a nifty invincibility token which renders you... yeah, you should know the routine by now.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Bash II is a top-down shooter similar to The Chaos Engine (in contrast to the predecessor which is more like Alien Breed). After a planet was attacked by aliens and enslaved their inhabitants, the player takes the role of an escaped prisoner who tries clean up the mess.

While moving through the maze-like environments, the player shoots a lot of aliens and has to solve a few basic puzzles (usually switch puzzles or finding keys) in order to open up the way to proceed. Some of those are optional and open up bonus areas with power-ups (e.g. additional life-energy or extra weapons like grenades) and money. The latter can be also earned by killing enemies and is used between levels to buy the mentioned extras in a shop. The goal of each of the eight levels is to first free all hostages (a radar shows the general way) and then kill the end boss who always the same with different attacks. There are three control options to choose from which determine how the player character behaves while shooting, e.g. it allows to shoot while moving or while spinning on the spot.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Breed is a top-down science fiction shooter somewhat inspired by the movie Alien in terms of plot and atmosphere. Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.

Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Breed 3D II: The Killing Grounds is a first-person 3D shooter with full-screen graphics. The story is directly connected to the ending of the predecessor: after a hard day's work the protagonist gets rescued by a space cruiser. But unfortunately shortly after an alien ship crosses their path and kidnaps the crew - now the player has 16 new levels to progress through in one-player mode. The action offers the usual DOOM-inspired gameplay: shooting everything in sight by using the ten weapons with limited ammo and searching for key cards. The enemies are working together and trying to adjust their approach depending on which of the many weapons the player is armed with.

There is no music within the levels, just ambient sounds. A level editor is provided, which is especially useful for the two-player game.</desc>

		<desc>A scientific outpost on a far off planet has been attacked. Nothing is known about the attackers, since all communications have been destroyed. A team of marines is dispatched to investigate and destroy the unknown invaders. As their dropships enter the atmosphere and approach the base, the defence lasers, damaged in the onslaught, move into action. They launch wild bursts of laser fire at the approaching marines, who are not prepared and take heavy losses. Rookies Nash and Jordan crash-land, and must fight off the alien force.

As with the previous Alien Breed, the gameplay is viewed from above. Your soldier shoots his way through the levels, collecting keys, ammunition and credits along the way. Computers can be logged into to buy new weapons. A new 'retreat' mode allows you to fire while moving backwards.

The game is largely non-linear, as most levels have multiple exits, and the game can be moved through in different ways. There is a variety of indoor and outdoor levels, although you spend most time inside some of the multi-level towers. After activating a self-destruct mechanism, you must escape the building quickly.</desc>

		<desc>Alien Legion is a side scrolling platform shooter similar to Hewson's Exolon which was released a few years earlier. Earth has been attacked and overrun by the evil forces of Marania. All the planet's soldiers were taken as prisoners, all except one, Captain Cosmose who happens to be the player. Now it's up to him and his laser gun Sycho to save the world. Gameplay involves walking from left to right, shooting at the various enemies that appear in the player's path and jumping between platforms to find the right route and avoid falling into a pit. Enemies range from regular aliens, armoured ones, aliens riding strange vehicles to more abstract flying things. Sometimes potions appear from killed aliens, which can be either green or red. If the player touches a green potion he regains some health but if he touches a red one he loses some. When all out of health, one of three lives is lost.</desc>

		<desc>You, Kai are about to marry your sweetheart Medb, but Slough Feg and his minions have kidnapped her and taken her to the far side of The Cave of Dreams. Swearing a bit too loud about rescuing her, Slough Feg has heard you and turned you into an insect. With the help of magic from the Druid Lords though, you set off on your quest.

To help you, some minions leave behind either a power-up for your weapon or Zen, the currency of The Cave of Dreams. Zen can be spent in the shops that litter the landscape. Here you can buy health or extra weapons. Kai has three lives which are lost when his two energy dots turn from white, cycle through various colours before turning black.

Alien World is a scrolling shoot-em-up. Various levels scroll horizontally while others scroll vertically. The screen will only scroll when you move so far across the screen. You cannot re-trace your steps. As well as the main playing area you can also see your score, amount of Zen, Energy dots, lives and various weapons. The joystick moves Kai, but not touching the joystick lets gravity kick in. The fire button fires your weapon.</desc>

		<desc>In Aliex, the player takes the role of a space pilot who was shot down over a planet. The good news is that the crash-landing was not instantly deadly. The bad news is that the enemy sends in their whole force to kill the player for good.

The game requires a lightgun which is used to shoot the numerous enemies appearing on the screen. There are a few enemy types which need more or less hits to be defeated; some of them unleash powerful attacks when they are not disposed of within a certain time frame. Of course the other enemies are also able to damage the player's life energy and running out causes death. Along with ammo, it can be refilled by shooting packages which drop in after a certain amount of points are earned. The background (first desert, then jungle) automatically scrolls from left to right and than back; the goal is to survive this ordeal often enough.</desc>

		<desc>One of the few computer games recreating cricket, the traditional summer pastime in many English-speaking countries. The game had different licenses with well-known cricketers in different countries. It was Audiogenic's second cricket game, 8 years after Graham Gooch's Test Match.

All the international sides are present, with the chance to change the player data and choose the team yourself. Test match and limited-overs matches are available, with 1 or 2 innings per team, and you can turn the Leg-before-wicket dismissal off, which makes the game easier to understand.

There are 3 skill levels - Amateur, Professional and World Class. The bowling involves positioning a cursor to place the bowl, then controlling the speed/spin (depending on the type of bowler selected). Batting involves timing one of the many available shots, and fielding is largely automated.</desc>

		<desc>Alpha Waves is a 3D game viewed from third-person perspective. The player pilots a "Mobile", a craft which bounces off of the platforms that fill the rooms. The player can rotate the craft left and right, thrust it forward, and move the camera up and down for optimal viewing. The game contains 256 rooms, which the player explores while in search of 16 crystals and 16 cubes. The Mobile bounces from platform to platform, making its way around the room to the doors that lead into other rooms. On the way, the player encounters many other creatures and vehicles, as well as surprises, such as rooms with reversed gravity.

There are two modes of play: Emotion and Action.

    In Action, players start in the central room, and work their way around with a time limit. Players gain time when going into a room they haven't been in before, and when crystal or cube power-ups are picked up. When time runs out, the Mobile explodes and the game ends.
    In Emotion, players can choose to start in any of the 12 regions into which the 256 rooms are grouped. The regions are arranged in the context of different areas of the human brain. While there is no timer, players also can't explore beyond the region that is chosen.</desc>

		<desc>You are a hero raised from the dead by the god Zeus to rescue his daughter Athena. With scenery inspired by Ancient Greece, you have to fight hordes of undead and demons, with a boss at the end of each level until you meet the god Neff, who holds the girl captive.

The Altered Beast title refers to your shapeshifting abilities. In this platformer, you can collect spirit balls by defeating two-headed wolves, allowing you to mutate into different beasts such as a werewolf, a dragon, a tiger, a bear and others depending on the version. Each form, tied to a level, comes with special abilities such as flight and powerful attacks, easily superseding the basic set of punches and kicks in your human form.

The game can be played in single player mode, or in same-screen multiplayer co-op mode.</desc>

		<desc>One fine day P. J. Barrett, an ordinary human being from the planet Earth, goes to a repair shop to fix his TV set. When he comes back for it, he accidentally picks up a wrong one. No big deal? Quite on the contrary. When the unsuspecting Mr. Barrett returns home and turns the TV on, he is sucked into a portal! One moment later he finds himself on the strange planet of Daltere. Naturally, this planet needs a savior: the evil alien Helmar has stolen an artifact known as the Jewel of Light, thus endangering the entire galaxy. Now our unlikely hero has to overcome various obstacles and to save the world.

Altered Destiny is a puzzle-solving adventure game. The interface is very similar to the one used in Les Manley games by the same company. The navigation can be done with the mouse (point-and-click), but the game still requires text input to issue commands to the hero and to interact with the world.</desc>

		<desc>Ambermoon is the second game in Thalion's never-finished Amber trilogy that was started out by Amberstar. The sequel is set more than half a century after the first game, the world of Lyramion just starting to recover from the destruction caused by the collapse of the red moon. The original protagonist is an old, dying man as the game starts out. He summons his grandchild and tells him about a vision he had, of an old friend who supposedly died more than forty years ago and warned him of a great evil rising again. He sends the youth on a quest to seek that old friend and find out what is behind that vision.

Concerning gameplay, Ambermoon is similar to its predecessor. The player initially controls only the main character, having the choice between a male and a female protagonist with several portraits each, but otherwise unable to customize them at that point. During the course of the game, additional characters may be recruited in various places in Lyramion; up to six form an active party that participates in combat. All characters can train physical attributes by specific NPCs in various towns, while some can also buy, learn, and cast offensive, supportive, and healing magic spells.</desc>

		<desc>Amberstar is a role-playing game which uses a top-down view for overworld travel and most indoor locations, and switches to a first-person pseudo-3D perspective when exploring cities and dungeons. Initially the player creates a single protagonist with randomly assigned attributes and no class designation. During the course of the game, additional characters (up to six active party members) can be found in different cities and other locations and recruited. Some of these characters already belong to established classes and come with their own abilities. Guilds of various classes (fighter, paladin, ranger, mage, monk, and thief) can be visited, where the protagonist and his class-less companions (if any) can be promoted. Choice of classes affects attributes, character growth, imposes equipment restrictions, etc. When leveling up, characters can train in specific locations, increasing attributes of the player's choice.</desc>

		<desc>Amegas is a clone of Arkanoid written by Guido Bartels for the Amiga and published by reLINE Software in 1987.

The player controls a paddle, situated at the bottom of the screen. The paddle can only be moved horizontally, and is used to stop the ball leaving the bottom of the screen. Should the ball leave the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life, and the ball is reset on the paddle. Every time the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears. When the player has destroyed all the bricks in a round, he or she will progress to the next round, and a new wall of bricks will be produced. The patterns the bricks are laid out in varies from round to round. Sometimes, upon the ball colliding with a brick, the brick will fall and can be collected by the paddle to produce a bonus for the player. The bonus the player receives depends upon the color of the brick which has fallen.

The game varies from its inspiration, Arkanoid, in a couple of ways. Firstly, the screen is much larger, and on most levels, there are a significantly increased number of bricks to destroy. Secondly, the bricks do not fall randomly; a small black dot on any one given brick denotes that it will fall if hit by the ball. (Although the color of the falling brick may vary)</desc>

		<desc>Released at a budget price around the peak of the WWF's original popularity, the twist in this wrestling game is the tag-team nature of competition. Each player selects two wrestlers from those on offer, and when the one in the ring is weakened he can go to the edge of the ring and tag his team-mate, who then enters the ring and allows the other to recover.

You can either play individual matches (for one or two players) or a full tournament, with three rounds of variable length. There is no joystick-waggling in the control system, with a variety of kicks, throws and punches on offer using simple joystick motions. Once the players are close together they grapple - this gives you a chance to lift and then piledrive your opponent.</desc>

		<desc>Amiga Karate (Karate/ST Karate) is a 2D one-on-one fighting game similar to World Karate Championship. The player controls a karate fighter through different stages that become more difficult over time. Fights take place against a single opponent and the health bars of the two are shown near the top of the screen. The character starts with three lives and additional ones can be gained by reaching certain scores.

When holding a button or key pressed the controls include moving backwards and forwards, jump, duck, high punch and mid punch, front somersault and block. When that button or key is released the controls offer turning, high kick, mid kick, low kick, high back kick, jump kick, foot kick and back somersault. Fights are fast-paced and require a lot of hit and run tactics.</desc>

		<desc>Amnios is a multi-directionally scrolling top down shoot 'em up set across ten levels, each representing a planet whose eco-system has been infected. The controls involved thrusting and rotating, similarly to Asteroids.

There are two ways to successfully complete the level - destroy enough of the infection to allow the planet to survive, or rescue enough of the citizens, Defender-style. For each of the organs to be destroyed, a specific weapon can be created to cleanse it easier - blueprints must be collected and taken back to your ship for this.</desc>

		<desc>As a Defender variant, Anarchy is a side-scrolling parallax shooter, in which you take on the evil Anarchists and their destructive behaviour. Your ship moves left or right on a looping level, shooting the enemies and finally the bosses. You have a single life with gradually draining energy. No less than 50 High Scores are recorded.

There are no surprises in gameplay, except the usual upgrades for your ship - X-shaped pods reveal circles, which can be collected to produce multiple fire beams, multi-directional shots, and drones with advanced cannons</desc>

		<desc>After naval combat, the second sequel to The Ancient Art of War is all about aircraft combat in World War I. It is a real-time strategy game in nature, and most of the time is spent on the overhead map. Here players plan their strategy and set the goals and routes for their aircraft. There are various statistics which are affected by the happenings on the battle field, e.g. destroying factories lengthen the time the enemy can get new aircraft. Overall the game features many real and fictional campaigns, as well as an editor to create more, with the winning condition to either destroy the enemy's flight force, his capital city or wearing him out.

When a flight battle or bombing occurs, the game switches to a side-scrolling combat screen. Here players actively participate in the combat; during dog fights the goal is to destroy the enemy and bombings are a matter of releasing the bomb at the right time while avoiding flak fire. Those sequences can be automatically calculated by the computer; then the pilot's skills affect his changes of success.</desc>

		<desc>A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.

Another World combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.

Typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.

Each level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>Another World, also known as Out of This World in North America and Outer World (&#x30A2;&#x30A6;&#x30BF;&#x30FC;&#x30EF;&#x30FC;&#x30EB;&#x30C9; Aut&#x101; W&#x101;rudo?) in Japan, is a 1991 cinematic platformer action-adventure game designed by &#xC9;ric Chahi for Delphine Software. The game tells a story of Lester, a young scientist who, as a result of an experiment gone wrong, finds himself in a dangerous alien world where he is forced to fight for his survival.

Originally developed for the Amiga and Atari ST and later released for the Apple IIGS and DOS platforms, the game was widely ported to other contemporary systems. Later efforts resulted in several game engine recreations for the game that permitted it to run on modern computers, consoles and mobile phones. In 2006, Chahi independently released a 15th Anniversary Edition for Windows which allowed the game to be played on modern computers with original or enhanced visuals; following up in 2011 for its 20th anniversary, ports of the game were prepared for iOS and Android based devices.

Another World was highly innovative in its use of cinematic effects in both real-time and cutscenes, which granted the game praise amongst critics and commercial success. It also influenced a number of other video games and designers.

Another World is a platform game, featuring a control scheme wherin the player uses either the keyboard, joystick or gamepad to make the protagonist run, jump, attack and perform other, situation specific actions such as rocking a cage back and forth. In the initial part of the game, Lester is unarmed, as he is able to kick at small creatures but is otherwise defenseless.

Later in the game, the player acquires a laser pistol from a fallen foe. The pistol has three capabilities: a standard fire mode, the ability to create force fields to block enemy fire, and a powerful charged shot that can break through force fields and some walls.[3] Eventually, Lester also gains a plasma ball that can be used like a grenade to defeat foes (not featured in the original Amiga release). Enemies also have the same capabilities, requiring the player to take advantage of the three gun modes and the environment to overcome them.

Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and the game ends immediately if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard.[4] However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep restarting at the last point indefinitely.

		<desc>Antago is a puzzle game played on a 5x5 square board. It can be played either against the computer, with a choice of up to 10 levels of difficulty, or against another human player. Other options allow you to play a match or start a training session, as well as select between "plain" (empty board) and "prepared" (pre-arranged balls on the board) game modes. A demo mode is also available, where the computer plays against itself.

An angel and a devil compete against each other, with the goal of aligning five "balls" in a row on the board, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They are moved around the board with the joystick, pushing each other as their paths cross, and strategically placing balls on the edge of the board to both disrupt their opponent's lines and try to create a line of 5 of their own balls.

Each level features different background and board graphics. There is no background music playing during the game, and only basic sound effects when the two characters push each other, place a ball on the board and win.</desc>

		<desc>1992, the year Apache Flight was released on Amiga, as well as Atari ST. Made by Minds I and published by Atlantis Software Limited. 

Good news: the Cold War is over and the world is at peace! Bad news: Terrorists stole a few leftover atomic bombs. Now the player has to use the new Apache attack helicopter in order to destroy the four terrorist hideouts.

Apache Flight is a vertically scrolling shooter in which the player spends the most time shooting enemies by using the two available weapons: the unlimited standard ammo (released by tapping the fire button) and limited missiles (released by holding the fire button) which are required to hit ground targets, e.g. cannons and tanks. Those missiles are also available in the heat-seeking variety which are automatically used up first. Fuel is limited and is constantly drained every second, but it can be refilled by hovering over fuel depots which are regularly encountered during the levels. However, when shooting them with a missile instead, the depot releases additional missiles to collect. Of course it is also important to dodge enemies and their bullets because every hit causes the loss of a life. When that happens, a new helicopter with reset fuel and missiles appears with a brief invincibility period at the point of death. The game is lost when all lives are gone.</desc>

Bonuses are awarded for a "perfect day" and each arrest over the quota. Picking up donuts extends the time limit for a day. Driving through filling stations refuels the patrol car. Driving through the garage daily upgrades the patrol car with brakes, guns, armor, radar, etc.</desc>

Gameplay scrolls sideways and is platform based, with a very cutesy and consolesque look, and 17 levels, each containing an extra hidden section. Each level has its own elemental setting, taking in the fires of Hell and the clouds and light of Heaven. The levels are full of boxes, which can be used as weapons by kicking them at enemies.

As you go you can also collect money, which can be spent in shops to buy useful extras. Many collectibles and other items exist, such as leaves (which change the effects of gravity, allowing you to jump higher and stay hanging in the air for longer), extra lives, fruit for bonus points, and balloons allowing a degree of vertical movement.</desc>

Most of the danger comes from wall mountings or static obstacles rather than actual sentient opposition. The levels are large and multi-directional, with a map feature to help you progress through each one. Power up weapons can be collected. The gameplay is quite systematic, with a measured approach working better than a gung-ho &#x2018;shoot first, ask questions later&#x2019; mentality.</desc>

		<desc>The Aquatic Games was conceived partly as an Olympics tie-in, and partly as a stop-gap for James Pond fans (the third platform title in the series (Operation Starfish) was in the process of being heavily delayed, eventually being released in 1994). This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics.



The events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the James Pond series (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.</desc>

		<desc>After a nuclear war, Earth's population is mostly wiped out. The survivors have build eight underwater colonies - that's all what left from humanity. Unfortunately, the nuclear war was just the beginning. An alien race, the Spurcians, made advantage from this situation. So they've conquered Earth and have taken those eight cities. Now the only survivors are inside the freight vessel Genesite, which is in orbit. On a last attempt to free the underwater colonies, the pilot Josh Aldrin (you) is send back. Meanwhile, the Spurcians destroyed the freight vessel, making you the last human on Earth. So, you are now on revenge...

Your job is now to flight with your craft above the water surface. Destroying enemy alien crafts and energy generators. When you destroyed enough generators, the energy shield from the main pyramid fails, and you can attack the level guardian. Once he is destroyed, you use the tunnel, which connects the underwater colonies, to get to the next one. You will play all eight colonies. While in the tunnel, you have the chance to collect power-ups to regenerate your ships energy (health). Inside a level, you have to live with the energy you currently have. Oh, and by the way, you have, like in reality, only a single life.

Now the only survivors are inside the freight vessel Genesite, which is in orbit. On a last attempt to free the underwater colonies, the pilot Josh Aldrin (you) is send back. Meanwhile, the Spurcians destroyed the freight vessel, making you the last human on Earth. So, you are now on revenge...

Your job is now to flight with your craft above the water surface. Destroying enemy alien crafts and energy generators. When you destroyed enough generators, the energy shield from the main pyramid fails, and you can attack the level guardian. Once he is destroyed, you use the tunnel, which connects the underwater colonies, to get to the next one. You will play all eight colonies. While in the tunnel, you have the chance to collect power-ups to regenerate your ships energy (health). Inside a level, you have to live with the energy you currently have. Oh, and by the way, you have, like in reality, only a single life.

		<desc>Arcade Snooker is a Sports game, developed by Team17 and published by CU Amiga, which was released in Europe in 1995.

Using the game engine from Arcade Pool, Team17 recreate the more complex game of snooker. The viewpoint is still from above, although the balls remain the same size on screen, eliminating any feeling of the table being larger than a pool table. The control system is identical to Arcade Pool, involving setting the speed before using the left button to position the shot and the right to shoot. The rules of snooker are fully recreated, other than the precise complicated miss rule. There are lots of computer opponents available, as well as a two-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>Arcade Trivia Quiz is a quiz game for 1, 2 or 3 players.

There are four blocks of questions. Each block contains questions in six categories;

    Art &amp; Literature
    Science
    Music
    Film and Television
    Sport
    History &amp; Geography

Icons representing these categories are displayed in a pyramid arrangement. The icons of available questions flash in sequence and the players must press FIRE at the correct time to select the icon of their choice. All questions are multiple choice with four answers, one correct &amp; three incorrect, being available.
Both question selection and answering are timed and must be completed in eight seconds.

Scoring is cash based. All players start with &amp;#163;1.00 and each player stakes 20p per attempt. If, by answering questions successfully, a player makes it to the top of the pyramid then they trigger a 'Cash Run' feature which can earn extra money - up to &amp;#163;5.00.

The game also has a random Jackpot feature in which a player can choose to either to bank the cash they have earned so far or double the money but risk losing it on an incorrect answer.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Archon, Archon II: Adept features a more complex board and enhanced gameplay.

Each side plays as an Adept - a powerful wizard with the ability to cast spells against other Adepts and his summonings - and must defeat the other side, either Chaos or Order, by attacking him/her with summoned Elementals or Demons. Each side can summon 4 unique elementals at a time or choose from 4 demons, common to both.

Gameplay is similar to the original, reminiscent of a chess-like board game, requiring strategy, but with arcade elements, especially when two adepts confront each other face-to-face. The board also shifts from time to time, making the strategy less predictable.</desc>

		<desc>Archon: The Light and the Dark is a strategic board game with some similarities to chess. Two sides, a light one and a dark one, consisting of 18 pieces each compete on a board divided into (9 by 9) squares. You win the game by having one of your units on each of the five powerpoint squares, by removing all opposing pieces from the board or by imprisoning the last remaining creature of the opposing side.

However, you can't just remove a piece from the board by landing on it. When two pieces clash, the outcome is decided in the battle arena during one-on-one real-time combat. If the real-time combat takes place on a dark square, the dark monster gets a health bonus (longer life bar). On a light square the light side gains an advantage. There are also some squares whose color changes over time (from afternoon, to dusk, to night, to dawn etc.), which adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.

Unlike chess the two sides are not identical. Both sides consist of mythological creatures. For example the light side has among others unicorns, valkyries and a djinni while the dark side features basilisks, banshees and manticores. The differences are not just cosmetic. Two special pieces are the light wizard &amp; the dark sorceress, they can both cast magical spells like: imprison a unit on the board, shift the flow of time (change day/night cycle to your advantage), bring one unit back from the dead etc.

The different pieces have their own movement restrictions regarding the number of squares they're allowed to travel on the board and whether or not they can jump over other units (like the knight in chess). Units also behave different in combat; some units are faster than others, some use melee attacks while others fire projectiles.

Archon can be played with either one or two players. The NES version, which was released a few years after the other versions, has improved graphics for the real-time combat part. Each type of square has it's own colored background and the unit sprites are larger.</desc>

		<desc>Arena is a sports game which features six disciplines, including Long Jump, High Jump, Javelin, Shot Put, Pole Vault and the Hundred Meter run. Up to four players can compete in the events, but not playing at the same time, but in a hot-seat mode. Control is like in other sports games: you have to gain speed pushing the joystick in a perfect rhythm, and pushing the trigger at the right time, i.e. to start jumping in the Long Jump and High Jump discipline.
Unlike other games of the genre, humor is not getting short, as a referee is constantly pestering at you, making sarcastic comments if you fail to reach very good results. Most events are visually presented on several screens which are flipped (not scrolled).</desc>

		<desc>Armageddon Man casts you as the Supreme Commander of a future barely balanced Earth. The Earth has been split into 16 separate nuclear capable countries, such as the Black African Republic, Japan and European Unite, and it's your job to make sure it doesn't become lifeless.

The game is controlled by a point and click interface where you can check messages, deploy satellites and troops, send food to the regions which need it, and spy on nations. You will regularly get messages that a country is deploying forces or increasing its diplomatic presence in another nation, and can show support or criticism for these. Be aware that these decisions have consequences - the 16 nations all have feelings of importance and would not want to be sidelined.</desc>

		<desc>Armalyte: The Final Run, like its C64 namesake, is a traditional side-scrolling shoot'em up heavily inspired by R-Type, giving the player's spaceship the task of traversing five levels. The starting setup is a simple forward-facing shot as well as a power shot that must be charged by holding on to the fire button. Upgrades are a forward-facing three-way, a vertical two-way, or the addition of a single backwards shot (only one of the three at time). Also available are pods that attach to the ship and fire a forwards laser, and, only in the final level, self-homing missiles.

The levels not only feature many enemy formations, but also environmental hazards, like drops of acid or falling stalactites. On one occasion, the scrolling speeds up, making the level a hazard course. Each stage ends with the customary end boss.</desc>

		<desc>Sequel to the previous 3D combat/strategy game from Psygnosis, in Armour-Geddon 2 your challenge is to defend the survivors of an apocalyptic disaster on earth, by destroying a satellite which aims to destroy the planet.

The game involves lots of resource management, as the neccessities to build equipment must be mined, new designs must be researched, and factory facilities are required to build them. Pre-defined missions are also handed out, including capturing strategic points and delivering resources.

The actual battles take place manually 3D, with multiple units under your control at a time, although you switch between them rather than controlling them all at once as in the Team Yankee series. The vehicles on offer include tanks, planes, hovercrafts and helicopters, all handling in considerable depth. If you have a spare Amiga, a null-modem cable and a friend, he/she can control units at the same time to help you out.</desc>

		<desc>Army Moves is a one-player game which is divided into two parts. In part one, you drive a jeep and must avoid collision with other jeeps and being shot at by helicopters. Then, you fly around in a helicopter and the oject is to bring down airplanes without being shot at by the airplanes themselves, submarines, and any other ground fire. Make sure you land on the pad near the end.

In part two, you start out in the jungle and must jump from rock to rock without crashing into toucans (shoot at them to make them fly higher) and being blown to bits. Then you have to make your way to the general's offices shooting soldiers on the way, and finally, locate the secret documents. When you complete the seven sections of Army Moves, you'll receive a higher bonus.

Some versions have a high score table to record your achievements. The second section must be loaded seperately, using a code attained from completing part one, on some versions.</desc>

		<desc>Arnie 2 is an isometric action game. Although it's obvious to which Hollywood actor the game's name alludes, Arnie 2 is not a licensed title and not based on any movie.

It is the sequel to the Amiga / C64 platform game Arnie (1992). Unlike the previous title it has been developed in-house by Zeppelin

Fast reflexes and a lust for violence are required for success here. Your average muscleman shoots and bombs his way through four enemy-infested territories: Shut down a chemical plant by blowing up enough pipeline valves. Clear an airfield from enemy soldiers, tanks and helicopters. Climb from battleship to battleship in a hostile harbor. And finally, rescue as many prisoners as possible from a jungle POW camp.

Naturally, the levels are crawling with enemies: from simple infantry armed with rifles, mortars or rocket launchers to MG teams, missile batteries and tanks. Most of the opponents are stationary and stolidly fire in a single direction; however, foxholes spew out cannon-fodder at a constant rate. To destroy such nests or efficiently dispatch groups of soldiers, Arnie has a (limited) supply of grenades. Some deceased foes drop more powerful weapons as well as invaluable first aid kits and extra lives.</desc>

		<desc>Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur is an illustrated interactive fiction computer game written by Bob Bates and published by Infocom in 1989. Typically for an Infocom title, it was released for many popular computer platforms of the time, such as the Macintosh, PC, and the Apple II series. Quite atypically for an Infocom product, it featured illustrations of locations, characters and objects within the game. It is Infocom's thirty-fourth game and is the second of two Infocom games developed by Challenge, Inc. using Infocom's development tools.

The player assumes the role of a young Arthur, before the legendary days of Camelot. The "sword in the stone" (which in the legends was not Excalibur, but is often confused with Excalibur by people unfamiliar with the legends) that would signify Arthur's destiny to rule, has been stolen by the evil King Lot. In the quest to regain the sword, the player must prove to Merlin that he has the qualities needed to be a great king: chivalry, experience, and wisdom. Merlin assists Arthur by giving him periodic advice as well as the power to transform into animals, but also tells Arthur that unless Excalibur is recovered within three days, Lot will usurp his destiny as a king of legendary stature.</desc>

You will battle numerous horrible creatures such as spiders and bats with your axe and avoid deadly traps while attempting to gain access to Morgause's castle. You will also search for 6 runes, which contain spells, that you must find in order to free Nimue. Artura contains 4 maze-like levels that are so complicated that poster sized map of the levels is included with the game.</desc>

		<desc>The Confederation of Syndicalist Republics is the setting for this strategy and combat game. Much like the similar looking USSR at the time, the society is crumbling, and you are an upstart aiming to take over power for yourself &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#xA6;.. erm, I mean, aiming to bring peace, harmony, prosperity and happiness. 

You start off in a small coastal province, and must progress by meeting people and negotiating to get them on your side &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x201C; sometimes the sword is mightier than the pen, sometimes not. You must ensure that the more militant locals are pacified, and that ethnic minorities are looked after.

While those sections are all strategic, there are also some vector-based combat sections. These ensure that brawns are required along with brains, and give the game some variety.</desc>

The game is in the platform style and you must jump and duck the various obstacles you encounter. The monsters you will meet include giant scorpions, beholders and fire elementals.

You will have to defeat Astaroth's 3 guardians of the soul along the way, firstly a sphinx, secondly a 3 headed hydra and finally a marlith demon. Once you have defeated the guardians you will have to face Astaroth herself in a battle of the minds using the powerups you have collected.</desc>

		<desc>The basic idea behind this one comes from Pengo, with a maze containing various arrangements of blocks as well as several baddies, who are all one square in size. You kill them by firing blocks at them, which carry on moving until they hit a bad guy (in which case both are destroyed and you get some points) or another block (in which case it comes to a stop). The way the level layouts change as you play allows you to potentially box in some enemies, so you can deal with them gradually.

There are also exploding bad guys (drawn as Lemmings), so watch out for the warning as they prepare. Some blocks are icy, meaning that they can't be pushed, and they destroy any block that hits them. Collectible power ups include a short-term baddy-freeze and short-term invincibility. There's a co-operative 2-player mode, in which you can, unusually, harm your team-mate.

An extremely sophisticated editor was tucked away in the game, allowing you to not only design a maze and position the baddies (including regenerating ones, set to come in at any interval), but also change their speed and how frequently they fire hazards out.</desc>

		<desc>Autoduel is a hybrid game based on Steve Jackson Games board game Car Wars. It incorporates elements of role-playing, driving and action-based combat. The game is set in a futuristic version of USA, where gangs and vigilantes rule the wilderness, and people's only protection are armored cars with mounted weaponry. The player is cast in the role of an average person who must at first earn enough money to buy an own car, and then perform courier missions throughout the country.

The game's progression is fairly open-ended: the player is free to visit different cities, explore highways, participate in car Arena battles to earn money, take on gangsters in the wilderness, salvage car parts, etc. A few courier missions must be completed in order to advance the story. The player can construct and customize vehicles using guns, mine-layers, smokescreens, oil slicks, rockets and other accessories, choosing between various body and chassis types for the car. The entire game is viewed from a top-down perspective.</desc>

		<desc>In the sequel to Barbarian / Death Sword, the Wizard Drax is back after your previous defeat of him. But this time, you're not alone. The princess you saved back then has taken up a sword and joined your cause! Now, it's more than a death match. You have to explore the many tunnels in his dungeon, defeat the dangerous monsters that come between you and put cold steel to Drax's throat. The game has similar game play to the original, but with a different challenge. Various monsters will come and attack you, but you'll need to use different approaches in order to defeat each of them. For example, you can't overhead chop a monster that's shorter than your axe. There are 4 dungeon levels to explore before you reach Drax at the final stage.</desc>

		<desc>Aztec Challenge is an Action game and unofficial Amiga conversion of Aztec Challenge by Cosmi. It supports two players simultaneously, developed and published by Bignonia as a shareware, which was released in 1993.

You have to steer your character through seven absolutely different levels. In every level new deadly perils lurk for the hero. The first is probably the most famous level. Left and right are some not exactly friendly meaning Aztecs, which welcome you with spears. You either have to duck under the spear or jump over it (depending on the height the spear is coming at). If you get hit you have to start again. In the later levels you have to avoid stones, poisonous scorpions and snakes and get over a bridge.</desc>

		<desc>B.C. Kid, or Bonk's Adventure is a 2D platform video game developed by Red Company and Atlus that was released in 1989-1990 for the TurboGrafx-16. In Japan it was released as PC Genjin (PC&#x539F;&#x4EBA;?) in 1989, a play on the Japanese name for the system, 'PC Engine'. The game was re-released for the TurboGrafx-16 in the U.S. in 1992 on the Gate of Thunder 4-in-1 game CD-ROM. The game was later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Amiga, arcade systems under different titles (FC Genjin, GB Genjin and BC Genjin). It is also available through Nintendo's Virtual Console service, on the PlayStation Store and there is a version for mobile phones in Japan.

Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.

Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power and a large one takes him to stage three. Eating a small meat while in stage two will also put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. When the third stage effect wears off he returns to the second state and remains there for a while before turning back to the regular Bonk. Eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.

Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.

Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</desc>

		<desc>Buggy Boy is a race game, but not just an ordinary race game. There are five different routes, offroad, north, east, west, south. The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out.

Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points.

There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.</desc>

		<desc>As the eponymous Baby Jo you're trying to make it back home. Can a simple baby get past the four levels while avoiding the bad-tempered animals and machines on the way? 



Baby Jo in: "Going Home" is a side-scrolling platform game. Jo can pick up rattles which can be tossed at enemies (such as bees, lawnmowers or spiders). Apart from watching out for the baby's dropping health (represented as an increasingly tearful face), the baby's diaper gets wetter over time and the thirst increases, too. If the diaper becomes too wet or the baby becomes too thirsty, the player immediately loses a life, so collecting fresh bottles and diapers is important. 



The game is multilingual (you can choose between English, French, German and Spanish)</desc>

		<desc>The plot of "Bad Company" is quickly told: Earth is dying and mankind needs new worlds to colonize, the Nu-Worlds. You and your (optional) companion have the task to clear those worlds from hostile alien insectoids.

"Bad Company" is played in a pseudo-3D view (third person) that very much resembles that of Space Harrier games.
Before you start to play you'll have to choose one of the eight offered troopers as your player character. This decision will influence gameplay later on, e.g. you won't be able to carry a specific weapon or your character is especially fast, and so on. When it comes to the action you'll be confronted with several different alien types including "level bosses".You battle these foes by using one of the four available weapon systems (equipment can be changed in the course of the game). You have full movement control over your character, meaning the screen isn't auto-scrolling like in comparable games. You can also take cover behind certain obstacles or choose to blow them up.</desc>

		<desc>The game starts in Washington D.C., where President Ronnie (based on U.S. President Ronald Reagan) has been abducted by the evil DragonNinja. The game's intro begins with the following introduction: "Rampant ninja related crimes these days... Whitehouse is not the exception...". As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent asks two street-smart brawlers, the "Bad Dudes" named Blade and Striker: "President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?" After hearing that, the Bad Dudes pursue the DragonNinja through the New York City streets, a moving big rig truck, a large storm sewer, a forest, a freight train on an old Southern Pacific line, a cave and into an underground factory in order to save President Ronnie.</desc>

		<desc>Badlands is effectively the spiritual successor to Atari's previous racing games Super Sprint and Championship Sprint. Similarly to the Sprint titles, Badlands pits three cars against each other in a three lap race around a small, single-screen circuit. Bonuses are present in the form of wrenches which can be traded for goods such as extra speed, extra acceleration or better tires

Unlike the Sprint games, Badlands expands upon the formula, taking place in a post-apocalyptic environment and equipping each of the players with cannons. In reality, the cannons do little except to slow cars down by repeatedly shooting at them, but the shop between levels offers the possibility of arming the car with missiles which will destroy the target car, placing it at a severe disadvantage as a replacement is brought onto the track, taking a few seconds.

The tracks also featured a number of new obstacles, including mines and retractable barricades.</desc>

		<desc>Bagitman is an arcade platformer. The player controls the name-giving Bagitman through several mine shaft levels composed of three screens each, his goal is to pick up money bags and put them into a wheelbarrow at the surface of the mine. Obstacles are pursuing guards, ore carts, and elevators. The only means of defence is a pickaxe, which stuns a guard temporarily. The same happens when the player manages to drop a money bag on top of a guard.</desc>

		<desc>Balance of Power is a computer strategy game of geopolitics during the Cold War, created by Chris Crawford and published in 1985. The game is notable for engaging the player in brinkmanship.

The goal of the game is simple: the player may choose to be either the President of the United States or the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and must lead the chosen superpower for eight years, seeking to maximize "prestige" and avoiding a nuclear war. Each turn is one year long; at the beginning of each year, the player is presented with a set of incidents and crises in various countries around the globe, and must choose a response to each one. Responses may range from no action, to diplomatic notes to the other superpower, to military maneuvers. Each response is then met with a counter-response, which may vary from backing down to escalation. The player then gets a chance to initiate actions, and deal with the opponent's responses.

This core mechanic is similar to that of Bruce Ketchledge's 1983 game Geopolitique 1990, published by SSI. One difference from the earlier game is how negotiations are resolved. In both games, backing down in a negotiation results in a loss of prestige, which will reverberate politically. Likewise, in both games brinkmanship may result in a global war. In Geopolitique, such wars were actually fought in-game, after which the game continued. In Balance of Power, such a war ends the game instantly, with the following message: "You have ignited a nuclear war. And no, there is no animated display of a mushroom cloud with parts of bodies flying through the air. We do not reward failure."</desc>

		<desc>The objective is the same as in the original Balance of Power: use your military, covert, and industrial forces to make your country the most prestigious in the world while avoiding nuclear war. However, it is now 1989, and the Communist Block is crumbling...

Chris Crawford, who rarely ever made a sequel to a computer game, was besieged by mails asking him to update his classic from a few years before to reflect the new state of the world. Russia was falling, the Iron Curtain was shattering, and smaller countries were beginning to assert their own regional power with more freedom from the bipolar world of the Cold War.

The result was the 1990 Edition. This game featured an updated database, but the most significant new features were:

1. The multipolar level, where small countries could go to war with their neighbors on their own. Of course, you could help them out (or encourage them!) by sending in military aid.

2. 18 more countries, bringing the total to 80.

3. A "Crisis Advisory Board" of four people, who would give you advice during international crises. The nice thing about being a Superpower is that the little countries do whatever you tell them, but you still have to watch out for your main rivals (USSR or the US).</desc>

		<desc>The Ball Game is a fun isometric puzzle game that is best played against your friends (or foes). The goal in The Ball Game is to be the player with the most points when all the players have teleported out (i.e. there are no empty squares left). Since different squares reward different number of points, the fun is to plan your moves so that you can create or capture balls on cream-colored squares (which award the most points). The player with the most number of balls therefore isn't necessarily the winner, and the limited number of teleports and its randomness adds an exciting random element to the game. This is the game best played with friends, as the computer AI is none too bright and will often teleport out even though it could still capture your balls. Unique concept, charming graphics, and great gameplay makes this a winner.</desc>

To do this, you will control an arrow that defines a direction, and pressing the fire key will launch a ball from this arrow in the direction the arrow points to; by launching balls at correct angles, you will manipulate the main ball and control the way it moves. Ballistix also keeps certain physics laws (namely gravity and friction), and will present you with varying obstacles in either one or two player mode.</desc>

		<desc>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu. The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler. You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.

The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China. You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</desc>

		<desc>It's a fairly interesting Commando-like shoot'em-up game that looks and feels very much like an 8-bit game. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, because I was referring to those good and enjoyable games that populated the C64 and Spectrum (Commando, Ikari Warriors, etc), the MSX (Knightmare, Hinotori, etc) or the NES (Ai Senshi Nicol, Gaiapolis, etc), so Banzai is refreshingly simple and playable. Having the chance of playing the japanese in a seemingly WW2 themed game is a rare treat (of this guise, I only recall Front Line on the NES). Having said that, though, the game could have used some better graphics...</desc>

However, Hegor was never very good with numbers, and before long he soon finds himself broke again and looking for ways to pay for his wine and women. Whilst in the busy hamlet of Thelston he encounters a woman thief who claims she saw the barbarian seemingly defeat his brother, except after Hegor left Necron's remaining minions came along, retrieved their master's body and set about resurrecting him.

		<desc>After a group of brave heroes defeated the wizard Mangar the Dark and freed Skara Brae from eternal winter, all seemed well in the world. However, the evil Archmage Lagoth Zanta shows up and splits the Destiny Wand into seven pieces, scattering them all over the land. The Destiny Wand has protected the lands for seven hundred years, and without it the realm will fall into chaos. Thus it falls upon the heroes to reforge it. One of them also has to ascend to the position of Archmage and use the wand to defeat Lagoth Zanta.

The Destiny Knight is the second installment in the Bard's Tale series, and a sequel to Tales of the Unknown. Like its predecessor, it is a fantasy role-playing game with first-person exploration of a pseudo-3D world and turn-based battles against randomly appearing enemies. The sequel features six towns as opposed to the predecessor's only one, and a larger overworld area. Dungeons contain more traps and puzzles than before.

The player can create a party of up to seven active characters, as well as create additional characters and store them at the Adventurer's Guild in every city. Available races are human, elf, dwarf, hobbit, half-elf, half-orc, and gnome. In addition, some monsters can join the party and be summoned during combat. It is also possible to store money and banks and gamble in the casino, though the latter feature has been removed from the PC version.</desc>

		<desc>Bargon Attack is one of the less known adventures from Coktel Vision, though it was one of the first that introduced the unique interface that was used in many Coktel games that followed.  It was also one of the first of Coktel's games to use FMV technology in cut-scenes.

The gameplay is a mix of science fiction, cyberpunk and comedy elements. It takes place in the near future when an alien race named Bargon conquered the Earth and enslaved its people. You take a role of the young programmer who decides to put an end to the cruel aliens. You'll travel through 20 or so locations. Each one consists of 1 to 3 screens, similar to other Coktel games.

Along your travels, you'll face dangerous creatures and some strange alien technology. There are some occasions when you can die (though the option to replay the level is always available), plus the game also features several arcade sequences.

		<desc>Base Jumpers was the second release by Aaron and Adam Fothergill's Shadow Software outfit for publisher Rasputin and was very simple in concept. In a 2D platform gaming style, players run up to the top of towers, trying to combine 3 letter pickups to collect plain daft bonuses (there were something like 500 different 3 letter combinations) and then jump off the building and base jump down the outside. The last player to avoid the sticky out bits of the building and successfully open their parachute before becoming pavement art wins the round.</desc>

		<desc>Batman: The Caped Crusader is an action adventure game developed by Special FX Software (Jonathan Smith, Zach Townsend, Charles Davies, and Keith Tinman) and published by Ocean Software in 1988. It was licensed by Data East and Erbe Software for release in North American and Spain. It was the second of three unrelated Batman games released by Ocean, after Batman in 1986 and preceding Batman: The Movie in 1989.

Batman: The Caped Crusader is an arcade adventure which uses a unique style, innovated by Jonathan Smith and Charles Davies, to display the action as though it takes place in a comic book.

The game consists of two plots involving The Penguin and The Joker. The Penguin plans to take over the world using an army of robotic penguins! In The Joker riddle, he has kidnapped Robin and has plans to blow him up.</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;BATMAN is a shadow in the darkness, as elusive as a dream. High above 
&amp;gt;the seamy streets of GOTHAM, he is a criminal's nightmare. The only hope 
&amp;gt;for a desperate city...
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;
















***Batman*** is an action video game developed by Ocean Software based on the 
1989 film of the same name. It was released in 1989 for the Amiga, 
Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Atari ST, Commodore 64, MS-DOS, ZX Spectrum.
The game is also know as ***Batman: The Movie***.
















***Gameplay***
















The game consists of five stages based on events from the movie. Each 
stage has a time limit and a health gauge (represented by Batman's 
face turning into the Joker's), with Batman losing a life if he runs 
out of either. The first stage sees players controlling Batman as he 
navigates the Axis Chemical Plant to confront Jack Napier, leading 
to the incident in which he becomes The Joker. In this level, the 
game features side-scrolling gameplay, in which Batman can use his 
Batarangs to defeat enemies or and his grapple gun to reach higher 
platforms and swing across gaps. In the second level, Batman rides 
in his Batmobile where he must dodge traffic and use a grapple to 
swing around corners to avoid running into the police. The third 
level is a puzzle section in which Batman must identify various 
components for Smilex, the deadly chemical Joker has put into the 
market. The fourth level takes place during Joker's parade, in which 
Batman must use the Batwing to cut away balloons filled with poisonous 
gas without hitting the balloons themselves. Finally, the fifth level, 
which reprises the gameplay of the first level, sees Batman make his 
way to the top of Gotham Cathedral to finally confront Joker.




***Reception***




The game was number 1 in the Spectrum charts for February 1990 and was awarded Game of the Year in Crash magazine. 
Computer Gaming World recommended the Amiga version to action fans, but reported that the Commodore 64 version was too buggy.

		<desc>Battle Chess is a video game version of chess in which the chess pieces come to life and battle one another when capturing. It was originally developed and released by Interplay Entertainment for the Amiga in 1988 and subsequently on many other systems, including 3DO, Acorn Archimedes, Amiga CD32, Amiga CDTV, Apple IIGS, Apple IIe, Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, FM Towns, NES, Mac OS, PC-98, Sharp X68000 and Windows 3.x. In 1991, Battle Chess Enhanced was released by Interplay for the PC, featuring improved VGA graphics and a symphonic musical score that played from the CD-ROM.

Battle Chess was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, resulting in two official follow-ups as well as several inspired games. Its remake, Battle Chess: Game of Kings, was released on Steam on March 16, 2014.</desc>

		<desc>Battle Chess is a quite typical chess game, but it comes with a twist: all pieces are represented by small, realistic figures that walk around on the chessboard, and when one piece takes another, they both take part in an animated battle. There is a different animation for each permutation, depending on which pieces are capturing or being captured. You can also play in 2D without animation. 

The game's opening library includes 30,000 different moves, ensuring a variety of games will unfold across the 10 skill levels. 

Multi-player support can be extended to modem and/or serial port play</desc>

		<desc>A sequel to the original Battle Chess, this game takes on a more Chinese approach, both in the rules of the game and in the presentation. 

Using a Chinese variation of the game of Chess, pieces like the Queen and Bishop are replaced by Counsellors, Ministers, and Cannon. Pieces behave differently than their European counterparts and even the board is set up differently. Two things remain the same: the ultimate goal of checkmating the opposing player's king and the Battlechess style animated battles that occur when two pieces contend for the same spot on the board.</desc>

		<desc>This side-view shoot 'em up involves trying to retrieve two nuclear weapons which have been stolen by terrorists. These are located at opposite ends of the playing area, so you can pursue them in either order. Needless to say, the terrorists have plenty of forces out to prevent you getting too far.

Unusually, the game features both a helicopter and a tank - you choose either from the base, and can fly/drive back there to change. The best strategy is to use the helicopter to shoot out air-based enemies and repair the various bridges, then return for the tank. You get 4000 seconds in which to complete all this, and losing a life costs you 500 of these.</desc>

		<desc>A top-down space shooter that was different from most others at the time in that it did not just scroll continuously in one direction, but could scroll at different speeds in all possible directions on the X and Y axis, on the player's whim.

The game takes place above the surface of a ruined, devastated planet: each level starts within a large area, in which your ship has free movement. Avoiding surface hazards, such as auto-aiming turrets, the goal is to destroy enemy spacecraft that hover around the large area in groups. Each wave of attacks is followed by a bomb-dropping mothership, which you must hurry up and destroy before it moves off the playfield, in order to proceed to the next wave; the last mothership gives way to the boss - a gigantic spacecraft that will chase you around the playfield. Beaten it? you are transported to a short section of standard shooter fare, where the screen auto-scrolls vertically, at the end of which you face a final monstrosity. This ends the level - on to the next one.</desc>

		<desc>Beast Busters is a rail shooter similar to Operation Wolf. The players take on the role of Johnny Justice or Sammy Stately (Paul Patriot only featured in arcade version) and must shoot their way out of the city. The arcade version had 3 mounted guns, allowing for three player simultaneous action. The home conversions support a maximum of two players.

The player must shoot everything that moves, while conserving ammo and grenades. Your machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, and you can use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets or just to clear the screen of zombie scum. Grenades you can pick up along the way include standard grenades, electro grenade and napalm bombs. Onscreen zombies explode in a splatter of blood and gore.

The screen scrolls in a variety of directions, sometimes in pseudo 3D. You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, throwing Molotov cocktails and knifes and other will simply jump right at you. You can shoot knifes out of the air if you aim well enough.

The bosses include a zombie punk who mutates into a dog, a freaky blob-snake-head that comes at the screen and a jeep which comes to life.</desc>

		<desc>Beastlord is an action game with puzzle-solving elements. The Lord of Darkness managed to trick the three guardians of the world (a unicorn, a hawk and a beam of light) into imprisonment and now overruns everything with his orc hordes. The player takes the role of a young man, who is called the Beastlord because he can interact with animals, and has to explore three levels with the goal to free the guardians. The levels are side-scrolling in nature, but there are many branches to map out.</desc>

		<desc>You take the role of Jethro. The aim of the game is to make your way through each level of the game, overcoming the various Rabbits allies you will encounter. For every six levels of the game that you complete, you will be given a code so that he can continue his struggle at a later date. However, the Rabbits don't take too kindly to this, so they send their biggest and most dangerous followers to attack you just prior to him being given the code. To defeat these large beasts, use your spin attack to propel the missiles back at them. Watch out, as rocks are too heavy to bat with your tail and you will use an energy point in trying.</desc>

		<desc>In futuristic Australia, there are giant cities owned solely by corporations, separated by a giant wasteland known as The Gap. When Robert Foster's Gap-dwelling tribe is killed by soldiers from Union City who capture him, everything changes for him. After a narrow escape from the helicopter bringing him there as it inexplicably crashes, Robert and his droid Joey must search the decaying city, attempting to befriend both the snobby rich and the frustrated poor as the two attempt to get out of the city, but in the middle of everything they uncover the dark truth about LINC, the bizarre computer which makes the city tick.

The game uses the Virtual Theatre engine from Lure of the Temptress, which allows its characters to move freely independent of the player's input, making the game world more dynamic than it is usually the case in comparable games. Otherwise, the engine provides traditional point-and-click adventure gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>As Ben E Factor himself, you must travel through the six moons of Minniat, on which the peaceful and good-natured people of Lullyat have been kidnapped. These Merry Men each have their own potential skill once rescued, so releasing them in the right order is often essential for completing a level. Some Merry Men have grey suits - this marks them out as joyless and awkward characters which must be guided through a coloring machine.

The Miniation people have loaded the 60 levels with various nasties, ranging from slugs (slow, but must be jumped), Rock Men (those with sharp backs are more dangerous, but both are quite nippy), spiked teeth emerging from manholes, and so on. A large map is provided, and at any point you can pause the game and scroll around the map, which makes the forward planning easier.</desc>

This is one of the early examples of a 3rd person perspective point &amp; click adventure, the interface being slightly more complicated than the famous SCUMM system.</desc>

		<desc>Brad Zoom takes on the Brain Eaters from the Purple Planet, in this homage to vintage action games, primarily Galaxians. There are 75 levels, accessed via passcodes.

You control a spaceship at the bottom of the screen facing upwards, firing at arrangements of aliens. You can move up and down as well as left and right as you shoot them. At set intervals an alien will emerge from the main pack and sweep down towards you.

Other levels feature Asteroids which split when shot, or a single &#x2018;boss&#x2019; alien. Aliens with green eyeballs release power-ups, such as improved weapons, shields and bombs. You have a single life with which to survive the carnage. You get points for surviving as well as scoring, so slow but cautious play is more rewarding.</desc>

		<desc>Eddie Murphy became a star in the police film Beverly Hills Cop, and it was this license that Tynesoft used to create a game featuring four distinct sub-games, each of which can be practiced from the main screen in some versions. First Axel Foley visits a warehouse to shoot out some bad guys in a Green Beret-influenced sequence.

The second level (first on the C64 version) involves driving after 3 lorries full of weapons, and shooting them out one by one, Chase HQ-style. Avoid contact and stay on the road to complete this. Next you must cross the grounds of a mansion, shooting anyone who gets in your way.

The final section is set within the mansion, and is first-person 3D, although with few movement angles and only one enemy on screen at a time.</desc>

		<desc>This sequel to Dark Castle has our formerly nameless hero now known as Prince Duncan continuing his adventures after he toppled the Black Knight's throne and was dropped by a gargoyle in Trouble 3. With Merlin's help, Prince Duncan finds his way behind the Black Knight's throne where there is a fireplace and mantle. At the start of each new game, Duncan tries to take a torch on the wall beside the fireplace, and the entire wall spins around to reveal a large Ante Room containing 5 pedestals for holding orbs. Your mission is to collect all 5 orbs to open a gate to lead you to a final duel with The Black Knight. 

This game has similar gameplay and 15 new levels - five of which scroll as opposed to the static screens of the past. These 5 are: Swamp, Black Forest, East Labyrinth, West Labyrinth, and Black Knight's Showdown &amp; The Final Battle. There are different enemies and items such as multiple keys and a helicopter pack which lets you fly in the Swamp and Black Forest levels. You must pick up Gas to use it also. The game map is larger with longer levels. Different elements present include weapons-based fighting, mazes, bombs which are used to destroy enemies or walls, and a health system. 

Some enemies will decrease your health when hitting you instead of killing you outright. Elixirs will protect your health but it will also deplete slowly over time and can be restored by picking up food or leaving the level. There is now the option to save your game but it must be done from one of the computers in the castle's Computer Room. There's also a new practice mode to try out levels. When playing in Advanced mode, there's a different ending to the game than normal.</desc>

		<desc>Long, long time ago (but not necessarily in a galaxy far, far away), there was a caveman named Big Nose. One day he went out of his cave and saw a pterodactyl flying around. "That will be my dinner", - thought Big Nose, took out his trusty club and ran after the winged reptile. Naturally, his quest for nutrition became much longer and more dangerous than he had ever imagined...

In this platform action game, you guide Big Nose through prehistoric levels, fighting prehistoric animals of various kinds. Big Nose starts out with his club, but will gain other, more powerful weapons. During your quest you can collect bones, which are the currency of the game. There are shops in which you can buy weapons and various spells that you'll be able to cast.</desc>

The player is required to select one side 'A' or 'B' in the conflict, and keep the save game for each pilot on a separate floppy.
Each pilot you can fly different missions and aircraft, but only those from your own side.

The player character flies from three land bases and two aircraft carriers on each side, and these bases can be damaged in several ways by enemy action, making them unavailable until repaired and reducing the available aircraft in the campaign.
Mission types are:
air intercept
air superiority
long range bombing
bomber escort
close support and ground attack
border or sea patrol
reconnaissance
troop drop
supply drop
stealth bombing
stealth reconnaissance
test pilot
An autopilot mode is available for longer cruises, if the enemies are far off. The 'test pilot' mission involves flying the X-15/X-29 and is not a part of the campaign.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Disney movie of the same name, The Black Cauldron focuses on the story of Taran, who is an assistant Pig-keeper in the land of Caer Dalben. One day Taran notices that one of his pigs, Hen Wen has magical powers. The Evil Horned King wants the pig so that he can locate the Black Cauldron and ultimately rule the world. Taran must now embark on a mission to rescue Hen Wen and defeat the Evil Horned King before his can discover the Cauldron's location.

The Black Cauldron is a side-view adventure game. Gameplay is similar to other Sierra adventure games of its day (such as Space Quest II or King's Quest III) but does not use a text parser. Instead the function keys are used to initiate actions. Players control Taran and can make him walk, run, swim and interact (talk) with other characters in the game. Puzzle-solving and advancement in the plot requires item manipulation of using the right item at the right time or at the right location.</desc>

		<desc>You pilot the Black Hornet, an advanced stealth fighter that can nip in and out without any sound to destroy any enemy. Once again the world is under threat from a madman so it's decided to send in you with the Black Hornet. You will encounter various enemies and ground installations who are hell bent to destroy you. As well as destroying these, buildings and various vehicles can be destroyed as well. Desert, valleys and mountains, sea and space will need to be flown through to complete your mission.

Black Hornet is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up viewed from above. The joystick is used to control your plane while the fire button fires one of various weapons. To select a weapon you press the space bar. You need also to keep an eye on your fuel gauge which slowly empties the further you progress.

Along the way you will see an airfield or an aircraft carrier. Pressing forward and fire on the edge of these will allow you to land on them. Be careful though because the enemy can still hurt you. Here you can buy more weapons and even re-fuel. These items cost you points so make sure you blast every thing in sight to boost your score.

As well as the main playing area you can also see your lives, score, damage gauge, fuel gauge and weapon selected.</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;Long ago, when the world was a dark and evil place, out of a black and 
&amp;gt;troubled sky emerged three fearsome dragons - creatures from hell, 
&amp;gt;bearers of destruction, flame, fire and torment. The world was plunged 
&amp;gt;into an age of devastation and misery. Only one man had the courage, 
&amp;gt;power and skill to challenge these servants of Lucifer. He was known 
&amp;gt;only as Black Tiger. Take on the role of Black Tiger, and, armed only 
&amp;gt;with your trusty mace, go forth and do battle - the restoration of 
&amp;gt;civilisation is in your hands alone!
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;
















***Black Tiger***, known in Japan as Black Dragon, is a 1987 platform 
game released for the arcades by Capcom.
















A barbarian hero jumps and fights his way through a variety of 
colourful, enemy-packed levels. The sprawling, eight-way scrolling, 
two-dimensional levels are packed with hidden bonuses to encourage 
and reward exploration. Though a percentage of these bonuses consist 
of dubious and often self-evident "advice", most come in the form of 
"Zenny coins", currency that allows the player to buy such items as an 
upgrade to their weapons and armour, keys for treasure chests, and 
anti-poisoning potions. Special items that reveal coins, upgraded 
armour, full vitality, extra lives, extra time, or simply bonus 
points may be found by attacking certain walls. The player's vitality 
bar will also increase up to three times as a reward for reaching 
score benchmarks.
















The Japanese version has a few changes that makes it more challenging 
than its American counterpart. Several of the "falling rock" obstacles 
were added in this version. Additionally, the prices of many of the 
items are higher and more points are needed to increase maximum 
vitality. But perhaps the biggest difference is related to fighting 
the later bosses (the three dragons and the dual sword-wielding foes 
at the end of stages 5 and 7). In the American version, it is possible 
to duck and avoid taking damage when the bosses touch the player's 
character as long as one of their projectiles does not hit him. 
In the Japanese version, the player is not able to do this.
















Europe-based U.S. Gold released versions of Black Tiger for 
Amstrad CPC, Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and ZX Spectrum in 1989. 
















A version for the Commodore 64 was released in 1990, developed 
by Softworx.

		<desc>Black Viper takes inspiration from games such as Fire and Forget and Chase H.Q., replacing the fast car with an armed motorcycle. As usual, this game takes place after a terrible nuclear war, with you playing as the son of a lost freedom fighter. 

The freedom fighters try to recapture the remaining cities from the mercenaries acting on behalf of the underground people who instigated the war in the first place. To do this, you must travel from city to city on the open roads, arriving within a given time frame. This is difficult due to the crowded roads, but luckily you can blow up most other vehicles with your gun. As the game progresses, enemy vehicles become harder, requiring more shots to be taken out. Luckily, your bike may be upgraded in the shop between levels.

Black Viper has a certain arcade-ish look to its graphics, a jukebox for choosing soundtracks, and comes in both OCS and AGA versions.</desc>

		<desc>Black Viper takes inspiration from games such as Fire and Forget and Chase H.Q., replacing the fast car with an armed motorcycle. As usual, this game takes place after a terrible nuclear war, with you playing as the son of a lost freedom fighter. 

The freedom fighters try to recapture the remaining cities from the mercenaries acting on behalf of the underground people who instigated the war in the first place. To do this, you must travel from city to city on the open roads, arriving within a given time frame. This is difficult due to the crowded roads, but luckily you can blow up most other vehicles with your gun. As the game progresses, enemy vehicles become harder, requiring more shots to be taken out. Luckily, your bike may be upgraded in the shop between levels.

Black Viper has a certain arcade-ish look to its graphics, a jukebox for choosing soundtracks, and comes in both OCS and AGA versions.</desc>

		<desc>The world has been enslaved by Murk, and you've got to free it by collecting the seven fragments of a tablet which are in the possession of seven wizards who inhabit seven towers.

Blade Warrior is a unique game in two ways, the most obvious being the graphics. Everything in this game is seen in silhouette - as you wander around looking for magical items and killing baddies, all you see is your silhouette and the silhouette of everything around you. The background is made up of a night sky, with clouds and hills.

Secondly, the game is an unusual mix of adventuring and battling. On your way to collecting magical items and exploring the huge ingame map, you're assaulted by baddies. Then, once you have collected certain artifacts, you can conjure up spells (so long as you have the recipe) back in your tower, trade with wizards for those all important tablet pieces and get clues to the next important artifacts.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the arcade game, Blades Of Steel is a hockey arcade action game (gameplay doesn't require the need to worry about statistics or provide the ability to customize teams.) Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer. In one player mode there are single game and tournament mode options. From time to time a fight may break out, which will provide a close up view of the two players. The player has control during the miniature fight game sequence, with the loser having to spend time in the penalty box. The referee will break up fights that go on too long, and calls a few penalties such as icing. Several short clips of digitized voices are also featured.</desc>

		<desc>The main character in this old fashioned no frills shoot 'em up is a Rambo doppelganger, which the developers may have been lucky not to be sued over. The main player is surrounded by a large tank which moves around as if you are walking it Flintstones style.

Gameplay follows the usual pattern for Ikari Warriors-style games - kill off the bazooka-toting baddies, which emerge from hiding places or enter the screen in waves. You can do this by either shooting them or running them over with your tank. Parts of the scenery often block your path and need destroying. Once you clear the level you are confronted by a boss, which in the first level is an enormous tank which you have to disable the guns of.</desc>

		<desc>Not the most inspiring name for a game, but then look at Worms and how successful that title was. Blobz steals its gameplay style directly from Lemmings, replacing the suicidal rodents with green nondescript things decked out with tiny eyes.

While Lemmings' motivation for suicide is biological, blobs just don't know any better. If they walk into spikes or water they die, but there's no stopping them. A walking they will go, straight into trouble. The puzzles themselves are satisfying, if frustrating and they have been well thought out using the various 'skills' which you can assign each Blob. Smooth horizontal scrolling and the neat moving water effects and special touches are very nice. While the platforms themselves might look basic, there is a good reason for this: a level designer has been included so you can make as many as you like, and it's simple to use. The game is based on six worlds each mapped out like a maze and there are 60 levels in total.

The amount of levels and the increasing difficulty means that this is not a fast game to finish. Add the possibility of infinite custom levels and you have a lot of game. A well recommended download.</desc>

The playing field is filled with different blocks and your aim is to fill them in so they form complete rectangles or squares. Only when you succeed in this mission, the concerned blocks will disappear. New 'unformed' blocks appear while the playing field scrolls down making you play into full action at all times. As soon as a line of blocks reaches the bottom line, it is game over.</desc>

		<desc>The speech in the introductory sequence probably sums things up best - "the biggest unanswered question is 'where is the money?"

The player has 4 missions to take on, in each case trying to kill baddies for the money they have, which can be spent in the shop rooms to upgrade their craft. Energy is depleted by contact with enemies and the walls, although there are some baddies who simply hover on your ship and steal, rather than physically doing damage.

The game is a shoot 'em up which scrolls both horizontally and vertically, while being viewed from an R-Type style sideways perspective. Navigating the levels sometimes requires the player to duck through gaps in scenery.</desc>

		<desc>A mix of future tech and gothic vampire story, in the cyberpunk style, BloodNet puts the player into the role of a man named Ransom Stark, who must battle a vampire named Abraham Van Helsing who is attempting world domination and save both humanity and the cybernet. Ransom Stark was bitten by the aforementioned vampire, but is able to fight off the infection with the help of a computer grafted onto his brain stem. He must then embark on a journey to defeat the head vampire, Dracula, to stop the infection.

The interface in BloodNet was standard point and click with some icon-based commands available from a drop down menu. The game featured a great deal of written dialog and puzzles, in addition to an open-ended travel system and random encounters. An alternate 'cyberspace universe' was also part of the gameplay, where codewords are needed to travel to different 'wells' (cyberspace locations). Role-playing elements were also present in Bloodnet: the player character and other recruitable characters for the player's party had number-based stats (such as Perception, Hacking, etc.), and combat was based on the player character's attributes and stats.</desc>

		<desc>The land of Trazere was once ruled by the powerful and benevolent organization of mages known as Bloodwych. Governed by the Grand Dragon, the Bloodwych supervised over the balance in the land, protecting it from evil and driving it to prosperity. However, the second-in-command of Bloodwych, named Zendick, turned against his group, banished his opponents to the astral plane, and began working on a mad plan - summon the ultimate evil, the Lord of Entropy. The player controls the champion of Trazere, whose ultimate goal is to stop Zendick and restore peace in the country.

Bloodwych is an RPG in the style of Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder, being a 3D first-person maze-like game. This game's distinguishing feature is the two-player split screen support, allowing simultaneous playing on one computer.

Each player controls a party of four characters. The four basic classes are warrior, mage, adventurer, and thief; however, each class also has sub-classes, which are represented by four different colors. These colors come into play also when the characters learn and combine spells.</desc>

		<desc>Blue Angels: Formation Flight Squadron is an F/A-18 flight simulator, with a focus on Air Shows. The Blue Angels are the United States' Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, known for tight maneuvers and precision flying. The game attempts to replicate this by offering formation flying, having to react and coordinate with other Blue Angels in the air.

The player can practice any maneuver in the simulator: dozens of high, low and flat maneuvers, Diamond 360 passes, left rolls and 4-point rolls or an entire air show for example. Other than practice events, the player can perform an air show or just go for a free flight. In the air, players fly from a 1st person perspective inside the plane or a 3rd person perspective from a chase plane behind the player. Additionally there are 4 different camera views and 3 different gameplay speeds. After the flight, an analysis is displayed of the flight and the player's performance graded.</desc>

Missions involve shooting down enemy planes, while others focus on specific targets. The game includes a very unique feature for those who chose to use it: the ability to convert the dogfights to turn-based battles fought on a hexagonal map but still maintaining the 3D view in a frozen window.</desc>

		<desc>This is an overhead-viewed racing game similar in style to Super Sprint. There are 7 courses of increasing difficulty, incorporating ramps and bumps which significantly affect the bike's handling. Each course has a time limit you must complete 3 laps of the course within, or it's game over. The further inside the time limit you are, the more points you score.

There's a computer opponent, but the scoring isn't affected by whether you beat him just so long as you qualify. There is a two-player mode. A unique feature at the time is the action replay, which can be viewed in slow motion.</desc>

		<desc>After ridding the neighbourhood of aliens from the planet Graaf Pooky, Bob was looking forward to some relaxation time. Bob was enjoying himself. He was sat in a deckchair, sipping some strawberry cordial through a straw with a knotted hankerchief on his head, protecting his small bald spot.

Suddenly, Bob heard a noise and saw a group of aliens from the planet Mord attacking his prized garden. They were attempting to steal all of his fruit! Back on their home planet, the aliens are running out of food, so they are attempting to borrow a cup of cherries off Bob, unfortunately they forgot to ask Bob first! This was too much for Bob, so he ran immediately to action, forgetting his flamethrower, Bazooka and even his bicycle pump. All he had was a machine for producing special balls, which he had invented yesterday. The balls are special, as they never lose momentum. You drop it from a high height, and it will bounce back to that same height, overcoming air friction in the process. The only problem was that the more the ball bounces, the colder it gets, and contact with a warm surface causes the ball to violently explode. Bob isn't worried, as he was wearing Asbestos gloves while sunbathing (His hands are very sensitive to sunlight).</desc>

		<desc>BoBo is a cartoon style arcade game. The main character is Bobo, an inmate who has been sentenced for seventeen years. He must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates. It is possible to play through the events in a sequence or one at a time. Up to six players (alternating, not simultaneously) can play this game. Each event can be played with joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. It is also possible to pick things up and toss them.

The game includes the following events:

    Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out.
    Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back.
    In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall.
    Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires.
    In the last event Bobo has been captured by the police and returned to his cell. He can't sleep because his cell mates are snoring and to stop it he has to sing lullabies to them. He has to climb the beds and not wake his cell mates by stumbling around his cell. When all cell</desc>

		<desc>Body Blows Galactic is a fighting game developed and published by Team17 in 1993 for the Amiga computers. It is a sequel to 1992's Body Blows. Opponents and background graphics from both games were later merged into the compilation release Ultimate Body Blows.

Gameplay
The gameplay system is the same as in the original Body Blows game. The game features single- and two-player modes, as well as an eight-player tournament mode.

Plot
After winning the global martial arts tournament, Danny and Junior decide to take the universe further and challenge the meanest and toughest in an interplanetary competition to become the ultimate galactic warrior.

Characters
There are 12 different playable fighters from six worlds, and no bosses:

Earth: Represented by Junior, a fast British boxer, and Danny, a gangland rebel (the Earth fighters are named after the Team17 game designer Daniel "Danny" J. Burke and programmer Junior McMillian). The arena is on the top of a rocket-propelled platform.
Eclipse: Does not rotate but still revolve around its sun, therefore on one side of the planet it is very hot and the other side is freezing. Inferno is a pure existence of fire, while Warra is the fighting king in white amour of the ice world.
Feminon: An Earth-type planet ruled by women, where men are only accepted as lesser beings. Represented by Azona, a blonde warrior who fights on her hover board, and Kai-Ti, a Psylocke-like brunette with the ability to focus her mind to shoot energy orbs. Fights are taking place in a water pit with waterfalls in the background.
Miasma: After a moon-sized comet hit the planet, the inhabitants of Miasma survived as an individual energy mass (which is illustrated as blue energy orbs). Puppet chooses an appearances with yellow cones bound together with blue energy orbs and a Venetian mask as face. The ghost-like Phantom wears a brown robe and is able to disappear and appear on different places in the fight area.
Gellorn-5: Consisting mainly of rainforest, dinosaurs are the dominant race of this planet. Dragon is a massive green creature using his brute strength to win the competition, while Dino is a Velociraptor-like creature with a small green rider on his back.
Titanica: Is the most technologic advanced planet of all the others. Lazer wears a visor and is able to shoot laser triangles; Tekno, a full metal robot which is able to shoot rockets to his opponents.</desc>

		<desc>Terrorists have planted bombs all over the Sellerscale Nuclear Processing Plant and will destroy the Northern Hemisphere if they aren't defused. You play the hero selected for this dangerous mission in this single screen platform game spread over various levels. On each level is a various amount of bombs and when one is nine seconds from exploding then you have to reach it and touch it to reset it before it explodes. If it explodes it will increase a radiation meter on the left of the screen and when it is full you lose one of three lives.

As you defuse the bombs, fuel capsules are sprayed out by a pipe and a certain number also need collecting and put in a box and you can carry as many capsules as you want. To reach higher platforms you can either use pipes that make you bounce higher or you can fall of the bottom of the screen to appear at the top. Moving about the screen is a ball and if you touch it carrying capsules then you lose them and you also increase the radiation meter. Once you have collected enough capsules and defused a certain amount of bombs then you move to the next level.</desc>

		<desc>Hypothesizing what sorts of adventures might be got up to in Bomberman's pants, this game provides some similar gameplay in a cartoony "adult" style -- mobile phalluses hobble around on their stubbly little testicles, collecting sex-themed bonuses (condoms for protection against STDs, jockey shorts to boost speed) and avoiding environmental hazards (viruses, AIDS, and the dreaded snapping-teeth-of-inexpertly-performed-fellation).

The player's "shot" can be used to temporarily neutralise enemies, open gaps in walls (revealing in the background a picture of a naked lady), or stun competitors in the multiplayer (up to 4 players) game. Once enough bonuses have been collected, doff a condom and hop into the sack with the blonde in the middle of the screen. Level layouts vary, but basic gameplay (and even the cheesecake in the background) remains much the same through 50 levels.</desc>

		<desc>Bomber Bob is a vertically scrolling shooter by Italian studio Idea. The player controls a dog flying a World War 1 plane, able to shoot both other aircrafts in the air (controlled by humorous caricatures of dogs, pigs wearing WW1 helmets and other animals) and bomb targets on the ground for coins, via a fixed crosshairs like in Xevious or Twinbee. These coins can be spent in between levels to purchase weapon upgrade and extra lives from a vending machine. Also in between levels the game offers a few false-3D flying stages where we see the plane from behind and have to fly through a tunnel while trying to avoid the walls. There also are a few end level bosses, mostly farm animals. The game is imbued with humor: destroyed enemies plummet to the ground like Wile E. Coyote from the Road Runner cartoons, accompanied by funny voices and sound effects, matching the cartoony feel of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Little Bombuzal has to blow up bombs on little islands in this puzzle game. In order to advance to the next level, all bombs need to detonate. There are various sizes of bombs. Bigger ones have such a huge blast radius that Bombuzal cannot trigger them directly - instead, he has to explode smaller bombs first and cause a chain reaction. So as one might imagine, later levels turn into loud blastfests that need to be carefully planned.

Besides, later levels introduce all kinds of additional hazards and gimmicks, like ice floors, movable bombs, disappearing ground tiles, and much more. Nobody said being a pyromaniac is easy.</desc>

		<desc>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.

As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</desc>

		<desc>Booly is a puzzle game with a similar concept to Gem'X in some ways. You are presented with a top-down view of an array of inter-connected blocks, which are shown in a variety of colours. The aim is to turn them all to grey, but clicking on them (using the pointer you are in control of) will often cause a pattern of other squares to change to the next colour in the sequence as well. You are doing all this with a time limit for each of the 300 levels. A level designer allows you to create your own sequence of up to 1000 levels.</desc>

		<desc>Botics is a Pong variant set in the future. It is disguised as futuristic sports event in which the player fights against five opponents. The basic idea is that each playfield has a large opening on two sides which are guarded by remote-controlled robots. Each of the opponents controls a robot with the goal to reflect a bouncing ball so it enters the opposite opening. If that happens, the screen switches to the next of five areas, e.g. if the players were in the second chamber, they either switch to area one or three depending on who scored. A player needs to score a certain amount of times to win a match.

Variations to the areas (which are the same for each opponent) consist of obstacles covering the middle of the room. There is also the possibility to charge up the robot which results in a more powerful and fast returning of the ball, but when overdone it causes the robot to explode.</desc>

All of the elements and hazards from the previous Boulder Dash outings are back: The fireflies, butterflies, growing amoebas, enchanted walls, and of course, the boulders. New features include titanium (indestructible) walls, growing walls, and slime that allows boulders and diamonds to drop through it at a varying rate.</desc>

		<desc>The wizards are revolting (and it's not just their personal habits). Whichever one passes the test of IOZU will become the grand master and dominate the rest. To pass this test the wizard has to defeat the dark side of his spirit by completing a series of memory puzzles. A pattern is displayed at the start of each level, which then has to reproduced by you. Unlike most games you don't control the pieces. Instead you operate a little wizard who has to scurry around collecting the pieces of the pattern as they fall from the heavens and then place them on board. The presentation is very slick. There's a good intro with sampled sound and a snazzy picture. The menu screen has a couple of finely animated dragons and there's an option that lets you trade gold (points) for tips which is another nice touch. 

Brain Blasters is fun to begin with, but after the fifth level, or so, the novelty value begins to pale. There's a two-player mode where a couple of wizards can battle it out for the pieces but even this becomes boring. Devotees of memory puzzles in The Express will probably like this, otherwise you'd be well-advised to try before you buy.</desc>

		<desc>Brat is an isometric action puzzle in which the player guides Nathan, the brat of the title, through a series of twelve levels. The isometric landscape scrolls up-screen, imposing a time limit on each level. Whilst Nathan automatically walks forwards at the same rate, if he is diverted he will begin to lag behind. If the screen catches up with him, the player loses one of three lives and must restart the level. Nathan is not controlled directly: the player must place icons onto the level to guide his movement. There are a variety of items that can be collected by Nathan, then later placed by the player to bypass certain obstacles: deadly spring toys can be suppressed with a lead weight, and building blocks can bridge gaps, for example.</desc>

		<desc>Brataccas is a video game released in 1986 for the Amiga, Atari ST, and Macintosh, and was the first game published by Psygnosis. It is a science fiction action-adventure game, with role-playing game elements.

The player controls Kyne, a genetic engineer who has developed technology for creating supermen. The oppressive government of the day desires this research to create a breed of supersoldier, but Kyne refuses to assist. In retaliation, the government frames him for treason, claiming that he is seeking to sell his work to the underworld. At the same time, the government secretly offers a reward to anyone in the underworld who turns Kyne over to them. With both the forces of law and lawlessness aligned against him, Kyne is forced to flee Earth.

During his escape, Kyne learns that evidence needed to clear his name can be found on the distant asteroid of Brataccas. Brataccas, first of the asteroids to be colonized, is a backwater mining colony with a "wild west" feel of lawlessness and corruption. Kyne has to find the evidence in order to win the game, obtaining it from the in-game characters.</desc>

		<desc>An early squad-level tactical combat game, much like the X-Com series of games and the more contemporary Laser Squad. Breach 2 features turn-based combat from an isometric point of view set in the far future. As one of the more unique aspects the squad leaders gain experience from successful missions should they survive.

Breach 2 is set in the same sci-fi universe as Omnitrend's Universe and Rules of Engagement series and shares the same backstory with those games. Breach 2 is a part of the IGS (Interlocking Game System) and compatible with the two Rules of Engagement games. This means you can use Breach 2 to resolve the tactical combat situations, boarding an enemy ship for example, you run into in the starship command simulation, which is the heart and soul of the Rules of Engagement series.</desc>

		<desc>Breach is a turn-based tactical squad combat game. It introduces team-oriented missions, RPG-style squad leader development and a scenario builder.

In the ten missions supplied with the retail version (and potentially infinitely more created with the included scenario builder), a squad of usually five space marines under the command of a squad leader embarks on sci-fi missions that involve hostage rescue, data retrieval or simply elimination of opponents. Squad members advance and act in turn on basis of a movement point system. 

The multi-level maps consist of outside terrain and structures with several stories, connected by lifts, filled with enemies and objects. Squad members can find and use weapons such as grenades, rockets or detonation packs and tools such as Medikits, scanners or shields.

In an unique twist, the squad leader advances from mission to mission (while the rest of the team is always new), improving his basic stats with each successfully completed assignment, based on his performance. Only experienced leaders may attempt STAR-rated scenarios. If the squad leader gets killed, he is lost forever: the game deletes the corresponding leader file.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you play Brian, the lion that closely resembles the Paddle Pop mascot. You must carry out the task of rescuing your friend Chris the Crystal, who has been kidnapped by Geeza the Dragon. His other warped jungle animal friends, Barry the Bear and Graeme the Gorilla, prevent you from getting to him and rescuing your friend.

Your job is to run through each level, destroying enemies that get in your way by either "clawing" them or jumping on their heads. Along the way, collect as many crystals as you can so that you can use them at the shop to buy extra lives, credits, heavenly hit points, jinormous jumps, really raj roars (which also kills enemies), and splendid speed. There are many secret areas in a level, some will take you on a different route other than the one you take when you reach the level exit. However, you must complete certain levels in order to progress further in the game, but you can return to a level that you have completed. You are given enough time to complete the level. If you run out of time before you reach the exit, you will receive no bonus. Furthermore, you do not get to access one of the three bonus levels that you can choose from if you do.</desc>

		<desc>Brides of Dracula is a two-player split-screen game similar to Spy vs. Spy in gameplay. Each player (human or CPU) controls either the vampire hunter Van Helsing or Count Dracula. Van Helsing is summoned to the Bistritz village to kill Dracula and his brides. His goal is to find thirteen tools to kill Dracula, bring them back to Helsing's home and store them in the cupboard. For Dracula, the objective is to create thirteen brides by finding women, biting and leading them back to the crypt, where thirteen coffins are lined up waiting for their recipients.

Both characters can be killed by certain hazardous environments and non-player characters (NPCs). Some of these dangers may effect only one of the characters (ghouls only attack Van Helsing, while priests and villagers only harm Dracula). Each player starts with three lives. Collected objects and women are displayed at the bottom of the character window, along with the health bar. The game takes place in the church cemetery and the adjacent village.</desc>

		<desc>Similar to Speedball 2, Brutal Sports Football is an ultra-violent sports game. Matches last 7 minutes, and the aim is to get the ball into the goal, kept by a net-minder. The oval ball can be thrown or kicked, this resulting in frequent up-and-under type kicks. 

Violence is the pivotal element of gameplay: rather than rare occurrency, punching, stomping, use of weapons, and even decapitations are what the game action is rife with, and key to victory. Bonus and non-bonus items appear on the pitch, such as bombs to throw at opponents, rabbits to speed up the current player, or tortoises which slow him down. 

Teams are a total of eleven and consist of seven humans and aliens, some of whom have unique skills. There's a lot of blood and flailing limbs, giving things a gruesomely humorous edge. Victory is achieved not only by scoring more goals than the opponent team but also decapitating all the players of it but one. The player is offered choice among a single match, knockout cup, and leagues to advance trough (for a total of four of them).</desc>

		<desc>Bubba is a happy-go-lucky animal delivery guy for the local Zoo here on Earth. One day, while going about his daily routine, Bubba is abducted by an alien that plans on delivering him along with several other aliens into his zoo. On the way back to his home planet, the alien spacecraft loses control and crashes and it gives the opportunity for Bubba, the other aliens and Stix (a sentient twig like alien) to escape. Bubba and Stix become friends and start on their journey home, They're now on an alien planet where things are a little bit different than they are on Earth. Take control of Bubba as he wields Stix as various puzzle solving tool (including a weapon), as they try to find a way back home. You'll have to solve mind-boggling puzzles and fight all kinds of wacky aliens. If you're planning to return to Earth, you'll have to have fast reflexes and be able to think fast and sometimes sideways.

The game consists of five levels that vary in terms of graphics, music and type of puzzles that need to be solved. On his way Bubba will find little blobs and other aliens that after each level are summed up and according to how many of them have been collected, the player is awarded additional seconds in the bonus level.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.

Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble and Squeak starts off similarly to many other platform games. Controlling a bald child, you move through a scrolling array of ledges, avoiding contact with nasties who release coins when shot. There are hidden areas to find as well.

Halfway through the first of the 30 levels, you meet Squeak and the full nature of the game starts. Squeak is a blue alien, who must also be guided through the levels. As he can't jump as high as you, he must sometimes be instructed to wait while you flick a switch or otherwise solve the puzzle of how to guide him through. If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.</desc>

If you stand on top of Squeak you can be launched into an extra-high jump.

Bubble Mode is an equivalent of Super Mario mode - it allows you to jump higher, run faster and shoot more lethal weaponry (bubbles in this case). It is activated by placing a coin into a Bubblegum machine, and then jumping on Squeak's back.

In between the main platform levels there are side-view shoot 'em up sections taking place underwater &#x2013; completing these earns bonuses.</desc>

		<desc>The story behind Bubble Gun is a simple one. You are a small crocodile with a gun that can fire bubbles (hence the inspired name) who is trapped in a castle and has to find their way to freedom. Quite why they are trapped in a castle, or why they are carrying a large gun, or indeed why they are trying to escape isn't made clear at any point, but then who really takes any notice of game plots these days?

What you are left wit is a very basic platform game, where you begin somewhere in the middle of a four-way scrolling maze. Dotted around the maze are a variety of objects, such as points bonuses, energy bonuses and time bonuses, but the most important things to look out for are sections of keys. You can carry three items at once, and there are three sections to each coloured key, so it isn't too much trouble to build up a complete key. Once you have the key built, all you need to do is find the chest with a coloured lock that matches it. Open the lock and fruit and gems fall out. If you're really lucky, a block with Exit written on it will appear. This is the key that opens the level exit, and is the one thing you are looking for.</desc>

		<desc>Budokan is a martial arts game covering Karate (unarmed combat), Kendo (using a wooden sword), Nunchaku (using piercing chain weapons) and Bo (using a staff). The player has a realistic range of moves and must use them wisely, as Ki (life-force) is drained for every move made, whether successful or not, and both this and your stamina level must be kept high.

You can practice your skills alone, or spar against the instructors or your friends. Finally, when you feel you are ready, you can travel to the martial arts world championship tournament at Budokan.</desc>

		<desc>The time is early morning; the place a usually tidy black garden, well cared for by the humans. But to your dismay you notice that your domain has become very untidy overnight. As you look up you see swarms of insects and bugs flying about mindlessly; with no apparent intentions of helping you clear up the mess. It would pear that the 'Evil-Slug' has been up to his old tricks again, and brain-washed the insects and bugs with a wicked spell. It soon dawns of you that it is going to take several days rather than hours to clean up and restore order in the garden. Quickly arming yourself with an insecticide spray gun you begin your quest.

Your task is to clear up all the trash in the garden by placing it in the trash can. When a piece of trash is picked up, it may be dropped by flying directly above the trash-can. You will see and hear the falling piece of trash. You can only pick up one piece of rubbish at a time, and you cannot drop fruits or other pick-ups into the trash can. Keep clear of the menacing bugs or blast them with your spray-gun. You cannot shoot the caterpillars which eat away at the magic mushroom. This is fair enough as they won't hurt you either. However, given enough time, they will eat up all your energy supply. Various other pick-ups may appear throughout the game. These may be worth points or help you out of a tricky situation. After tidying up each garden, and ridding it of bugs, you will be faced by a large end-of-day guardian. It is up to you to work out the best strategy to kill it or get past it.</desc>

		<desc>A computer's mazelike circuitry is infected with bugs, and you have been sent in to destroy them. You are armed with bombs, mines, blockades, and various types of hatchlings, which when released will track the bugs and hopefully stop them.

The basic gameplay is inspired by Dynablaster, but it differs because there is more than one way to kill the foes off. Depending on which way you push the joystick as you press fire, you will either release a quick-exploding bomb, a proximity mine, or a hatchling. Collecting EN' symbols will restore your energy, and IQ' symbols increase the ability of your hatchlings to track and hit your foes. Be careful when placing blocks; it is possible to shut yourself in.

The single-player game gives you three lives, plus another when you complete each of the 50 levels. The multi-player game can be played in 2 different ways - co-operative (work together to clear the computer of bugs) or competitive (Dynablaster-style free-for-all destruction).</desc>

		<desc>Buggy Boy is a race game, but not just an ordinary race game. There are five different routes, offroad, north, east, west, south. The offroad course loops around back to the start, the others are long runs with a distinct beginning and ending. You must complete each leg before the time runs out.

Along the way you can pick up all kinds of bonuses. The colored flags are 30 points each, collect all colors in the order as indicated at the top of the screen to get 1000 bonus points. There are several gates the give you 100, 250 or 500 points, and a time gate. Drive through a time gate to collect it, you receive two seconds extra time upon completing a leg. Occasionally there will be a soccer ball on the road, hit it and it will fly away and you get 2000 points.

There are bridges and tunnels, be careful not to fall off the bridge into the water or crash into the tunnel wall. There also are obstacles like boulders, logs and fences. If you hit them it will cost you valuable seconds off your leg time. But if you hit a log or small stone just right, the buggy will ride on two wheels until you hit something again.</desc>

		<desc>The story of this game is quite simple, presented during the intro as a series of short scenes without words. Melba is an easy-going guitar player who is having a picnic with his girlfriend; suddenly, an ultra-strong, evil-looking character appears and kidnaps the poor girl, sailing away on his ship. The brave Melba swims after the ship, and finds a bottle with a map inside. Knowing now the way to the evil kidnapper's lair, Melba embarks on a journey without further hesitation!

The premise, the map with the "stages", and the side-scrolling view indicate a platform-type action game; in reality, however, Builderland is a puzzle game, somewhat similar to the famous Lemmings. As in Lemmings, the player has no control over the protagonist himself (except on a few occasions, when "boss" enemies must be defeated by throwing certain objects at them). Instead, the player must manipulate the environment in order to build a path for Melba, deal with the enemies, etc. Melba is for the most part entirely helpless and simply walks forward automatically. Various items such as boxes, weapons, platforms, etc., must be collected and placed properly in order to save the hero from premature death.</desc>

		<desc>The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, based on the three stages of every civilized society &#x2013; its ascent, heyday and downfall. Burntime starts at the end of a flourishing civilization. The main goal of the game is to conquer the remaining habitable areas, as well as to survive.
To progress through this game the player must establish sources of food and water. The player must then clear out hostiles and hire mercenaries to guard the location. Armor can be found in the form of protective suits, and all elements of a suit must be collected for full protection.
There are three classes of mercenaries: doctors, technicians, and fighters. Fighters are good at defending areas and killing monsters. Technicians are needed to combine scrap items to produce working items (for example, wire, plus screws, plus a woodpile will produce a rat trap, a great source of food and income). Finally, doctors will heal the player and his men if he keps them over a period of time.</desc>

		<desc>Intelligence reports suggest that POWs have been captured and are being held hostage at the guerilla outpost on Butcher Hill. The game is divided into three sections.

In the first section, players steer their dinghy along a river while avoiding mines and other obstacles. If the dinghy comes into contact with any mine, it explodes. However, when the player has collected ammo, the mines can be destroyed. Coming into contact with rocks causes the dinghy to bounce out of the water for a short distance. When a jetty appears, pressing the fire button allows the player to land and start the next section.

The second section has the player finding their way through dense jungle whose path lead to the enemy camp at the base of Butcher Hill. Stopping you from proceeding are soldiers that have orders to shoot you on sight. Mines are also scattered around the jungle floor and must be avoided. If players were able to obtain a compass in the first section, their current direction will be displayed at the right of the control panel. Shooting all the soldiers in the jungle gives the player extra ammunition and stamina.

In the final section, players need to destroy the enemy camp by blowing up huts with bullets or grenades. While they are doing that, they must also be on the lookout for any soldiers that tries to leave the camp to bring back more soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Cabal is a shooter where the protagonist runs back and forth along the bottom of the screen, ducking and dodging bullets and grenades from the enemy. The roll maneuver from the arcade was not implemented in the PC version. The player returns fire by moving a target around the screen which also moves the player character and may expose him to enemy fire.</desc>

		<desc>For those of you who have not had the pleasure of Asteroids here is a description: The game is displayed in high contrast black and white, that's just black and white, there are no shades of grey in this game. Your ship is a small white triangle, in the centre of a black screen. When the game starts, asteroids, large irregular rock shapes, drift gently into view from the outer edges of the screen. Your ship can rotate in either direction, and fire, so this is what you must do, in
order to prevent your ship from being destroyed. As your shots hit the asteroids they break into smaller and smaller fragments, and the directions and speeds imparted to them seem to be highly convincing.

Cabaret Asteroids is a near perfect conversion of Asteroids for the Amiga. Its not in technicolor, there is no music, and the sounds are simple but effective. The playability of the original has not been surpassed though. I really can't fault the Cabaret Asteroids conversion, you can play by keyboard or joystick and it feels just like 1980, but without Sting and the guys in the background.</desc>

		<desc>The first in the strategy series set in the Roman Empire's peak era starts off with you as ruler of a small province, although if you're successful you will get tougher assignments.

You must build the city, placing crucial features such as housing estates, roads, policing, water supply, social events and the like. You're not restricted to one city - you can build another area, linked by roads, once you've got the first one running smoothly. You have slaves at your disposal to build and maintain everything.

All this would be easy if you had an infinite supply of money, the civilians didn't complain about anything, there was no threat of combat, and you didn't have to keep the people above you happy. Needless to say, all of these problems crop up.

Via the forums, you will get public opinions, which are affected by how high taxes are, and whether people feel they're getting value for money. If they don't they could riot;- what will you tell the Emperor if that happens?

Barbarian threats are commonplace, so you need to maintain an army, and at times send it into battle. If you own Cohort II, you can fight the battles using that, but otherwise you just issue the orders then learn of the result.</desc>

		<desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<desc>Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action game with strategy and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad of up to four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets</desc>

		<desc>Captain Blood (L&#x2019;Arche du Captain Blood in France) is the name of a French video game from 1988 made by ERE Informatique (soon relabeled with their short-lived Exxos label) and released by Infogrames. It was later re-released in the UK by Players Premier Software. The title tune is a stripped down version of "Ethnicolor" by Jean Michel Jarre.

The titular character of the game is a 1980s video game designer, Bob Morlock, who had picked "Captain Blood" as a nickname in tribute to the film starring Errol Flynn of the same name. Morlock develops a new video game about aliens and space travel. While testing for the first time his new project, he becomes warped inside the spaceship of the very game he had designed. Soon after, Blood is forced to go into hyperspace mode and, due to an incident, gets accidentally cloned 30 times. For 800 years, Blood tracks down every clone, as each one took a portion of his vital fluid. When the game begins, Blood successfully disintegrated 25 clones but he needs to kill the last five clones who turned out to be the most difficult to track down or he will lose his last connections with the human species.</desc>

		<desc>Captain Planet and the Planeteers was a video game released for various platforms in the early 1990s, loosely based on the environmentalist animated series, Captain Planet and the Planeteers and produced by the third party developer Mindscape Inc.

The Amiga/Atari version has five stages, one for each planeteer, and a final stage in which Captain Planet could be controlled. Each planeteer stage has at least one objective, while some had two: to clean up pollution using the planeteer's magic ring power, and/or to rescue a particular type of animal with the aid of one of the planeteer vehicles. Completing the objectives opens the exit gate for the level; touching environmental hazards or the unusual monsters in the level will lose the player a life, while failing the objective by killing any of the animals will crack the planeteer's ring depicted at the bottom of the screen (in the Amiga version), opening the level's exit gate early. The final level allows the player to control Captain Planet, who must navigate to the end of the stage by using and swapping powers held in bubbles throughout the level, before defeating one of the ecovillans, which is either Hoggish Greedly, Dr. Blight and her computer MAL, Looten Plunder and his assistant Argos Bleak, or Duke Nukem.</desc>

		<desc>Captive is a science fiction role-playing video game released by Mindscape in 1990. A Dungeon Master "clone", it featured pseudo 3D realtime graphics from a first-person perspective.

The player characters are androids (termed "droids" in the game) operated remotely by a prisoner trying to free himself. The player assumes the role of the prisoner, and the game involves visiting and destroying a series of bases on different planets.

It was released on Amiga, Atari ST and PC (1992) platforms.</desc>

		<desc>The Cardinal of the Kremlin is a global management simulation.

It is the time of the Cold War. An American ground reconnaissance satellite discovers a strange structure near the northern border to Afghanistan. It is identified as project "Bright Star" - the Soviet laser ICBM defense system, capable of destroying satellites and airplanes with a beam of energy. At the same time, the USA is busy developing their own SDI project, code name "Tea Clipper". And as the race for the deployment of a space-based laser defense system begins, KGB and CIA agents swarm out to infiltrate the laboratories. Among them: The United States' top spy in Moscow, the Cardinal of the Kremlin.

Based on the popular novel of the same name by US author Tom Clancy, The Cardinal of the Kremlin puts you in the position of US project leader. Your task is to build, test and deploy a network of laser defense satellites before the Russians manage to do so. In this time of crisis, however, all your actions are overshadowed by the threat of espionage and treachery. The scientists that you hire may be geniuses, but are they trustworthy? The more technology tests you schedule, the easier it is for Russian spies to steal your knowledge. If you tighten up security on the other hand, the overprotection will throttle research efficiency. As you race against time and an invisible enemy, the word "paranoia" gains a whole new quality.

Luckily, the counter-intelligence department is at your command, too. CIA agents in Moscow not only supply you with information on the Soviet project's progress, but also on KGB operations in the USA. How accurate the reports are, however, is for you to judge. You must also supply the Afghan warlords Archer with weapons and equipment, as only he can launch a desperate attack on the Bright Star base that will hopefully throw back the Soviet project for months. You conduct battles in a simple top-down action sequence.</desc>

During the game you should jump your way through 5 different levels full of different inhabitants (such as clowns, rats, monkeys, golf-players, etc.), climbing the ladders, entering the passageways to teleport to another locations, using the supporting devices (such as powder kegs to jump higher), collecting the different kinds of useful items from the chests, killing the enemies jumping over them, blowing them away summoning the limited amount of whirlwinds in the visible area, or morphing to the bull for limited amount of times. The parrot is flying over you and helping you to eliminate the flying enemies. On each level you have to gather the keys to open the gates, push some switches or levers, and collect certain items for some kind of picture.</desc>

		<desc>Defending the ancient Carthagean Empire from Roman invasion is your challenge in this arcade-strategy fusion.

Your armies can be supported by catapult and elephant-mounted units, but only if these are already available and you find them first (building doesn't really come into play). Guarding the hills also gives you an advantage in combat.

Each unit becomes more skilled and happy if they win battles, but fatigue comes into play if they fight too frequently. You need to pay for the soldiers, which is done by producing goods to trade.

Actually distributing the cash appropriately involves transporting it via Chariots, which improbably leads to an arcade racing-type sequence in which you must avoid not only rocks and trees, but also Roman chariots (why they are heading in the same direction as you every single time needs explanation) - contact loses you money.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay involves controlling a cartoon-like car called Arnie, jumping from platform to platform and avoiding enemies. If the time limit of level was reached a demon like creature called Turbo was released which homed in on the play within 15 seconds and this would cost the player a life.
The objective of the game was to drive over every platform in the level which changed the platform in some way (for example, in the construction zone the platforms are girders with holes for rivets. A rivet would appear in the hole once it was driven over), once every platform was run over Arnie would be picked up by a helicopter and taken to the next level. At the end of three levels, Arnie would rescue an animal friend and continue on to the next themed level.
Themed levels include: construction site, Halloween, garden and other various themes.</desc>

		<desc>Initially the player chooses between playing as the prince or princess. The character not chosen is then taken away by a dragon to Castle Eternity. (The location of keys and some other items differ slightly between the two characters.)

The game requires the player, through a first person view, to explore Castle Eternity. There are riddles on many of the castle walls, which give gameplay hints. There are also keys and pentacles hidden in various locations for the player to collect. Many rooms contain spirits which attack the player and reduce his or her health. The player's health (represented by a barbell where weights indicate the amount) is also the player's strength which is important for some puzzles. The player's only weapon is an unlimited supply of rocks to throw, but a single hit is sufficient to exorcise most of the spirits. The ultimate goal is to kill the boss spirit Magister (who can only be killed when all other spirits in the castle are destroyed) and thereby rescue the character's opposite number.

There are no lives for the player; if health is reduced to nothing the game is restarted from the beginning unless the player loads a saved game.

The game was ranked the 39th best game for the Commodore Amiga in Issue 0 of Amiga Power (May 1991). It did not feature in any further Top 100 listings. A budget re-release was reviewed by Linda Barker in Issue 17 (September 1992) receiving a 70% score.</desc>

		<desc>Castles II expands on the original by changing the interface and adding video cutscenes on the CD-based versions.

You choose to be one of five feuding lords vying for the Crown. Conquering, spying, sabotage, diplomacy, whatever it takes--as long as you keep the Pope and your people happy. You have to reach 7,000 points to petition the Pope for the throne, and then you have to maintain those points for 4-5 game months to win the game. However, your rivals will attack you as soon as the Pope declares his support, so be sure you have a strong military before applying for the Papal backing.

Castle building is more efficient and easier to deal with. You can also set up pre-made castles on file so that you can place them quickly. Battles are set in a full alternate screen with the ability to place and command each unit.</desc>

Blast your way past a myriad of alien guardians and natural hazards in your desperate rescue mission.

An interesting characteristic of Cavitas is that the caverns are dark but illuminated by two beams on the ship and other light sources throughout the levels. Progress is made by exploring, finding keys, destroying enemies, and locating parts of a spaceship.</desc>

		<desc>Eskel and Sogrom are the greatest magicians in the land, and both are hungry for power. The long war between them is beginning to enter Endgame, in the Rochebrume cluster of 23 islands, each with their own special range of magic on offer.

The game is highly strategic, with icon-based controls and a turn-based structure similar to Battle Isle. You will need to destroy the rival wizard's forces on each island. It's important to hold as many castles as possible, so as to generate the maximum amount of magic. Magic is used to move and create your forces, and to weaken your opposition.</desc>

		<desc>"Wow, what a weird plot and if that wasn't surreal enough the wonderfully detailed graphics add even more to the superb atmosphere as do the creaking sound effects and simulated speech (and no, it isn't Welsh!). Some of the characters encountered are truly bizarre - ever tried making love to a spider woman? The puzzles themselves are very cryptic indeed but there is much more to the game with underground caverns to explore and your girlfriend to rescue while you avoid being chopped up on the sacrificial altar! The icon system is extremely easy to use and an extra tactical element is introduced in using the useful psi powers. A brilliantly implemented science-fiction adventure with wide-ranging appeal." - Zzap! (Sep, 1989)</desc>

		<desc>In the first part of this game, you will have to train your character in the various chambers of Shaolin. Each exercise, which includes balancing on trees, kicking a pendulum and dodging objects coming towards you, will improve your skills like stamina and strength. The better you do in the chambers, the easier it will be for you in part two.

Part two is a more traditional 2D fighting game where you have to advance from level to level by beating your opponents up.</desc>

		<desc>Boxing causes brain damage? I dunno what you mean 'Arry. It's an art, a sort of ballet with knockouts. At least you won't get hurt playing Linel's version of the 'gentlemanly' sport. You are a young fighter on being WBC champion. To achieve this you'll need to beat the existing champion. But he won't fight you straight away, so you must defeat a number of lesser opponents before you get a title shot. After a couple of backstreet fights you're spotted by a manager who will train you in the gym with the sandbag, punchbag and skipping rope. How well you do here determines your 'condition' for the next fight.

During a bout the boxer is controlled in typical beat-'em up style and can win either by a knockout (reducing the opponent's energy level to zero) or on points.</desc>

		<desc>At the end of The Chaos Engine you managed to put a stop to Baron Fortesque's out of control machine, only to free the Baron himself from its clutches. Unfortunately not everything went to plan after that. During the confusion the Baron snuck away back into his own contraption and into another time period. Our two heroes decide the only way to stop him is follow him, but unfortunately luck isn't on their side...

Both players (either two human or one human and one computer controlled) are trapped within the Chaos Engine and can only escape by helping the Baron rebuild the engine. He will reward the character who helps him the most by granting him freedom, thus pitching our two heroes against each other.

Whereas The Chaos Engine was a two-player co-operative game, The Chaos Engine 2 is a two-player competitive game!</desc>

		<desc>A time traveler from the future was stranded in Victorian England, and his knowledge of yet unknown technological inventions was passed to the Royal Society, headed by Baron Fortesque. With the help of this knowledge, Fortesque managed to construct an immensely complex artificial intelligence known as the Chaos Engine. However, creation rebelled against its creator, assimilated its mind, and turned Britain into a war zone populated by mad machines. Mercenaries are willing to enter this dangerous place and put an end to the chaos, hoping for an appropriate reward.

Chaos Engine (Soldiers of Fortune in the US) is a run-and-gun overhead shooter. Sixteen levels (in four groups of four) await the players in the game. The basic gameplay is similar to Gauntlet, but in an open air setting, with bridges across rivers and other features in the maps. The visuals are in the 'metallic and blue' style Bitmap Brothers appeared to favor.

There are six characters available in the game, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and different starting prices. In two-player mode each player chooses a character and plays co-operatively, but in one-player games the player also chooses a character for the computer to control, with its artificial intelligence allowing it to open doors, pick up power-ups and take on enemies away from the ones occupying the player-controlled character.

		<desc>The Chaos Engine is a top-down run and gun video game developed by The Bitmap Brothers and published by Renegade Software in 1993. The game is set in a steampunk Victorian age in which one or two players must battle the hostile creations of the titular Chaos Engine across four landscapes and ultimately defeat the Chaos Engine and its deranged inventor.

It was first released for the Commodore Amiga, a version available for AGA Amigas, and later ported to MS-DOS, and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Atari ST, Amiga CD32, Amiga 500, RISC OS and Sega Mega Drive platforms. In the SNES and Sega versions, the character The Preacher had his clerical collar removed and was renamed The Scientist. The U.S. versions of these two ports were retitled Soldiers of Fortune. A sequel to the game, The Chaos Engine 2, was released in 1996.

The setting is a steampunk Victorian era England. The backstory of the game has some similarities to William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's novel, The Difference Engine, also set in an alternate history Victorian age.

A time traveller on a reconnaissance mission from the distant future became stranded in England of the late 1800s, and his technology came into the hands of the Royal Society led by Baron Fortesque (based upon Charles Babbage), a grand inventor. Fortesque then retro engineered many of the futuristic contraptions, creating an entirely different, alternate timeline.

Baron Fortesque then succeeded in his greatest creation yet - the Chaos Engine - which was able to experiment with matter, and the very nature of space and time. Unfortunately for the rest of the proud kingdom, the Engine then proceeded to become sentient and captured and assimilated its creator, then began to change the countryside for the worse. Vile monsters and destructive automata appeared everywhere, and even prehistoric beasts were resurrected. Telegram wires connecting the British Isles to the European mainland are cut, and any ship attempting to enter a British port is attacked. The British Royal Family, along with members of Parliament and a large number of refugees manage to escape across the sea, bringing with them many tales of horror. The British Empire is left in tatters, and the world in economic and political chaos. This lures a number of mercenaries on a potentially rewarding quest to infiltrate the quarantined Britain, find the root of the problem and swiftly bring a full stop to it.

You are given a mission briefing before you start which gives information on the suspect and what car they drive. Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again.</desc>

		<desc>The Chronicles of Omega is a side-scrolling platformer in which demons took control over the village Omega. The player takes control over one of the twins Alwin and Irma in their quest to drive those evil beasts out. Most of the time is spent with jumping, dodging enemies or killing them with the magic wand which shoots fire balls. The player character has a bar of life energy which decreases when hit by an enemy and when it runs out, a life is lost. Killed enemies leave money behind which can be used to purchase power-ups in shops.</desc>

		<desc>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game. As you may remember, Chuck Rock had to rescue his girl, Ophelia from the bad dude Gary Gritter. Well, he was successful in his efforts, and now Chuck and Ophelia are married. Eventually, they have a son, named Junior. Chuck works in a factory, where he develops great skill at carving automobiles out of stone. A rival manufacturer becomes jealous of Chuck's abilities and kidnaps him. Now it is up to Junior to rescue his dad!

The gameplay in this sequel is similar to the first game, but with some minor differences since you are playing as Junior, rather than Chuck. This is a side-scrolling platform game with occasional rock-moving puzzles thrown in. Unlike Chuck, Junior carries a club that gives his attacks further reach.</desc>

		<desc>Chuckie Egg II is a sequel to platformer game Chuckie Egg, but is very different from the original game. Whereas the original game features eight levels of one screen each, this features many more screens arranged into a maze for you to explore.

In the game, Hen House Harry must build a giant chocolate egg, with the ingredients (cocoa, milk and sugar), that are found in the factory. Eight of each must be included. Also, the eight parts of a toy kit must be found, to place inside the egg.

In order to get all the items you must find your way around the factory, avoiding many types of enemy, and solving puzzles using various items that you can carry. There are a number of ways to get around the factory, including the platforms of the original, but also ropes and pipes, among other things.

Despite the drastic changes from the original, the game still retains the sound effects from the original.</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;Take the wheel of a high powered police car in this race around the 
&amp;gt;famous area of San Francisco.
&amp;gt;The Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's Wharf, China Town, Twin Peaks all 
&amp;gt;flash by with exciting realism.
&amp;gt;Blast the horn to shift other cars out of the way, as you tackle 5 
&amp;gt;levels of non stop action, but only the best can make it - ***so hit 
&amp;gt;the gas pedal and race for glory.***
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;




***Cisco Heat*** is a 1990 arcade racing game developed and published by 
Jaleco.
















***Gameplay***
















The player takes on the role of an officer who must race his squad car 
through San Francisco in an attempt to win the first ever 
'National Championship Police Car Steeplechase'. The gameplay is similar 
to that of other contemporary racing games, with a two-speed shifter 
and a chase view. It includes sights such as the famous trams and the 
Golden Gate Bridge. The player can pick from two cars, a Ford LTD Crown 
Victoria-lookalike police car and a Nissan 300ZX turbo-lookalike police 
car.
















***Ports***
















In late 1991, versions for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, 
ZX Spectrum and PC were developed by ICE Software and released by Image 
Works, shortly before the Robert Maxwell-owned company folded. Stuart 
Campbell suggested that the Amiga version he played had little in 
common with the arcade game, but was a good game in its own right.

		<desc>Cliffhanger is based on the 1993 Sylvester Stallone movie. The lead character, Gabe Walker, is an expert in high mountain search and rescue and receives a distress signal from a plane that has crashed nearby. However, the plane is actually loaded with terrorists who hijacked a large shipment of cash. The game consists of side-scrolling action. The hero can walk, run, jump, punch, and kick while jumping. Further, he can perform special feats as the situation requires, such as crossing a rope suspended from two cliffs. One of the biggest threats in this game is nature as Gabe must defend against wolves and birds, snow falling off cliffs and structures, and falling rocks.</desc>

		<desc>On each of Clockwiser's levels, you are presented with a level layout, and a target layout, with the aim being to transform the former to match the target. The levels consist of a collection of cogs, which can be rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise to achieve this goal. There are lots of special blocks to help out, including bombs, diamond-producers and anti-gravity blocks. Each level has its own time limit, ranging from seconds to minutes - this doesn't start until you make your first move, and you can look around the level at your leisure before making a stab at it. Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.</desc>

		<desc>In 1945, a solicitors' clerk from Birmingham, England, paid a visit to Waddingtons Games Ltd. in Leeds.  Anthony E. Pratt, his wife and a couple of game inventing friends came to present their prototype of a mystery detection game to the game manufacturers.  The people at Waddingtons liked what they saw and agreed to produce the game.  Three years later, Parker Brothers brought the game to American mystery lovers - and it's been a family favorite ever since.  The very latest version of that original game is "CLUE MASTER DETECTIVE".  And now you can play it on your computer.  Play the role of your favorite hero or heroine from Detective literature.  Pretend you're Sherlock Holmes, Nancy Drew, Charlie Chan and Miss Marple, all rolled into one.  There are so many possibilities of Who, Where and With What Weapon that the mystery to solve is different for every game you play.  Choose to play against your friends, the computer opponents, or a mixture of the two.  use your logic and deductive skills to discover 'whodunit' by a process of elimination.                           "The game is afoot!"</desc>

		<desc>Despite the name conjuring up images of a cutesy platform creature, your charge in this game is in fact a helicopter armed to the teeth. The game requires at least a 68020 processor, which is understandable considering the amount of action going on at times, and the speed and visual detail this is conveyed in. It was one of the few Amiga games to include a Virtual Cockpit mode, and this can be controlled using the mouse with a quick button press.

The game&#x2019;s missions are set up in such a way that you are not necessarily the lead man. The two sides fight each other irrespective of your placement, and act on instinct with unusually complex AI, meaning that the exact nature of the missions vary each time you play. The missions all involve shooting at the enemy planes, helicopters and tanks though, and there is no particular war structure in terms of the mission orders</desc>

		<desc>Cobra is not quite as bad as in this horror scenario - but almost! In the first stage you can see an old man standing on a bridge and throwing like a boomerang thing at you. Every touch with the thing costs energy. However, the fact that it is almost impossible to avoid them gives the game the very special charm that can even rip the eyes out of the most intrepid black belt carrier...

If you can beat the rabid pensioner, you land again on a bridge, but in a bonus level. This is not a fight. Instead, the hero must bend hard and capture as many flying fish as possible. This sounds so simple and is (again) so incredibly difficult, that one could become a vegetarian. You have to catch a certain number of raft fishies within a short period of time, otherwise you can start again from the beginning!

The remaining sections offer other opponents, like punks and a domino with whip, but in terms of playability they are all in agreement. We were also in agreement: Despite satisfactory graphics, solid sound, a lot of striking techniques (fist blow, foot sweep, gauntlet, etc.), Cobra is not a winner!</desc>

He fights against various robots, but has limited ammo. The main aspect of the game is using teleporters, elevators and switches on the walls in order to unlock certain paths and go further.</desc>

		<desc>CAP is an accurate flight simulation based around the F-14 Tomcat and the F/A-18 Hornet. Both launched from a carrier during Operation Desert Storm, you receive your missions and carry them out.

The usual options apply, like configuring your aircraft, and choosing a pilot, but there are some more unusual options, like calling in sick for a mission. This causes you to skip a mission if you don't like the sound of it, but if you use it too much command may get suspicious.

The flight model is realistic, and there are some animations. One feature missing from the PC version is the strategic side - you control the ground operations while flying to support them on the Amiga version.

		<desc>Several levels await your super-tough Commando in this arcade conversion. Armed with only a standard rifle and a few grenades you must take on hordes of Nazis. Some are wandering around in the open, while others have picked out hiding places, which you must approach from certain angles. Trees, rivers and bridges create a varied combat-like terrain and must be incorporated into your thinking. Extra grenades can be collected, and will definitely be required, as they allow you to kill form distance and thus avoid some enemy shots.</desc>

		<desc>Computer Scrabble is the earliest official computer version of the popular word game. The game has a 8500-20000 word dictionary depending on the computer, containing the most frequently-used words in Scrabble. As a result, some very obscure words (mostly of 2 and 3 letters - keen Scrabble players will know that these are often the most profitable scoring method) are included, but common words such as 'bigot' and 'sheen' are queried by the game - simply tell it that your move is a word and it will move on trustingly.</desc>

		<desc>Essentially an update of 8-bit game Theatre Europe, your task is again to play World War 3 scenarios fighting as NATO vs the Warsaw Pact.

The game uses pretty basic handling. While you can access some menus as the bottom of the screen you can see the map on the main part of the screen where each unit is indicated as small square. Your aim, of course, is to eliminate all the enemy units.

Some special actions can be selected, like deploying special units, attack with chemical weapons or even nuclear ones.</desc>

		<desc>Conflict is a political/strategy simulator, inspired by a prediction of how events in the Middle East could unfold in the 1990s. In this 1997, the Israeli prime minister dies (either by assassination or by bomb blast), and you're appointed as the new prime minister.

In the game you have to make and follow political policies regarding other countries in the Middle East, control intelligence and purchase arms, try to beat the other countries in the nuclear race and keep peace with the Palestinians and, of course, conduct battles with other countries.</desc>

		<desc>It is the ninth century, and Camelot, the legendary castle ruled by King Arthur, has fallen under a curse. Famine and drought plague the kingdom because of the love triangle between the king, his wife Gwenhyver, and the knight Launcelot. It appears that only the mysterious Holy Grail can restore Camelot, and three knights - Launcelot, Gawaine, and Galahad - embark on a journey to find it, and soon disappear without trace. King Arthur leaves his castle in search of the missing knights, hoping to locate the Grail as well. His quest takes him to real and mythical locations in England, and later to Jerusalem and other areas of the Holy Land.</desc>

		<desc>Corruption is one of Magnetic Scrolls' interactive fiction games. The player takes control of a stockbroker on the fast track to riches. Suddenly, there are attempts on his life, with the words 'insider dealings' floating around. The hero is framed for a crime he didn't commit, and must prove his innocence before it is too late.

The game is a text adventure with graphics; the player inputs verb commands to interact with the environment and advance the story. The gameplay focuses on realistic investigation and information-gathering rather than puzzle-solving.</desc>

		<desc>It's obviously very easy to ruin a simple and addictive game by over complicating matters, and that's exactly what Starbyte have done. OK, so it's technically impressive, and it looks exciting, but the simplistic gameplay doesn't lend itself to such an over-polished production. The computer opponent is the final nail in the coffin. He's not offensively intelligent, so he rarely attempts top trap you, but once you've got him in a corner, he prcisely covers every single square available to him which takes an age. It's immposible for a human player to act with such accuracy at ridiculous speeds, so the computer player invariably wins.

So, if you're still gaggin' for a decent version of Tron, check out the public domain market. I'm quite sure you'll find a more enjoyable and much cheaper version than this feeble offering.</desc>

		<desc>Cosmic Bouncer is an action game similar to Bounder in which the player takes the role of a tennis ball which was made alive by a space beam caused by a computer mishap. Not only that, but it also finds itself at some distant place in the universe.

Now it has to travel through 22 automatically scrolling levels to find the way home. Movement consists of bouncing, and there are many obstacles like holes, disappearing floors or death tiles to avoid. Most platforms disappear after a touch and the player can use a limited function which creates a platform under the tennis ball. Failing a level, e.g. by falling in a hole, causes a life loss in the 11 main levels. After every level there is a shorter bonus level. It is still possible to fail the level, but instead of losing a life the player just gets teleported to the beginning.</desc>

		<desc>In Cosmic Pirate the player takes the role of a criminal who works for The Council, a space pirate organization. It offers several missions to the player, all with the goal to hijack a space truck. During the course of the game the player will undertake increasingly more dangerous and difficult missions.

This game is a multi-directional shooter. For each mission the player gets transported to the estimated destination of the truck. However, the correct space sector has to be found first through the means of elimination. The player uses warp beacons to go to the next sector and when the correct one is found, the radar shows the way to the truck. 

However, every usage of a beacon costs money which is earned by shooting alien ships in the current sector, which can be freely explored in all directions. Every killed enemy gives credits and probably leaves an extra behind which gives advantages if picked up, e.g. bonus credits, a protection shield or a smart bomb. Money left after finishing a mission can be reinvested into ship upgrades.</desc>

		<desc>This multi-level action/adventure takes players back 40 years to find Professor K.K. Renegade, who predicts that a catastrophic asteroid is heading straight for earth. You're in charge of finding Professor Renegade.

Select one of the five most intrepid Adventurers from England, France, Germany, Japan, and the U.S. to spearhead the search. Professor Renegade was last seen in the unexplored region of the highest Tibetan ranges; an area populated by creatures and conditions of the professor's own design: venomous stone snakes, reptilian birds, and acid storms. Not only must your Adventurer survive these tests of courage, but he must and properly use such curious objects as spurs, a vacuum cleaner, and a unicycle. Once you locate the professor and convince him to help, you'll need to help him construct an anti-asteroid deflector to prevent the destruction of earth. You must now search for high-tech tools such as an atomic pile, a 9-volt battery, and a bent coat hanger!

Use the joystick and the appropriate keys to maneuver the Adventurer across the landscape. You have 30 days to complete the mission. During the mission, the Adventurer collects various items (points are awarded for each). Some items serve little purpose; others are vital; and others only work in certain places. Only one item can be held at a time and it must be held to be used. Native bearers carry the items collected.

To look at what each bearer has, type 1 or 2 to scroll through the bearers. The Adventurer can exchange the item held (press S) with a bearer that is closest to him. Its trial and error time. Good luck. The game comes with cheats and a map for those that require a little help.</desc>

		<desc>Linus had crash landed on a distant planet called Earth, and made his way back home again. Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion). To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location. Whenever you wish you can receive a password allowing you to continue the game later from the same point.</desc>

Due to technical limitations, the ZX and CPC versions were presented in gray - however, the Commodore 64 and Amiga versions are presented in full colour (and the latter also incorporates an extra "snap" game, reminiscent of the Spade Panels in Super Mario Bros. 3).</desc>

		<desc>At the beginning of the 21st century, a mad scientist by the name of Mr. K has created an army of artificial soldiers. He conquered the industrial city of Atlantis, and is now preparing to take over the world. The United Nations decided to retaliate by sending two of their top class Special Forces officers, Ben and Andy, infiltrate the city and destroy the enemy base using a newly developed time bomb--Sigma.

Crack Down is a time-limited action game. The two heroes, Ben and Andy, have to get through the levels as quickly as possible placing bombs on X marks scattered around the levels. Although the levels are heavily defended, the player has an array of weaponry including a cannon, machine gun, and superbombs.

The game may be played as either a one or two-player game.</desc>

		<desc>Starting Titus' racing series of third-person perspective racing games, Crazy Cars encompasses the American Cross Country Prestige Cars Race. This takes in several parts of the USA, in several powerful cars. Initially you have a Porsche 911 Turbo in your hands, but this can later be upgraded to a Lamborghini and then a Ferrari. There are other cars on the road, which you must avoid contact with. Bumps and divots in the road throws the car off course, as does contact with any of the roadside barriers. Each race must be completed within the time limit.</desc>

		<desc>Crazy Cars 2 is a crazy racing game. You're at the wheel of the fabulous Ferrari F40 and in a race against time in a bid to smash a stolen car racket - the only problem is the guys involved in the racket are corrupt policemen! You go tearing through the states of America in search of the corrupt police, you will also have problems with the honest road cops who don't appreciate the sight of a Ferrari F40 crossing their state at 200 miles per hour...But, it aint that easy! You must plan your route carefully from the maps of each state which are displayed on your screen and which show the actual American freeways that you will travel on. 

Be careful, the shortest routes aren't always the easiest as the sight and sound of a blue flashing light will soon make you realize. Your Ferrari is furnished with the latest radar which will enable you to detect Police road blocks which may have been set up to catch you, therefore keep an eye on the freeway junctions as you may be forced to change your route!</desc>

		<desc>Distress calls received from deep space report hostile alien life forms, and you are the only space security captain within range. Responding to the distress call, you hurry to save a spaceship, a space station which has had its reactor put on self-destruct to prevent the station from falling into the enemies hands, and the lunar base that have become infested with Creatures.

The spaceship, although seemingly abandoned by the Creature, has inside, guard dogs and beastoids that fire weapons. They were left behind by their master. You must survive their attack to find life-sustaining supplies and the key to disarm the reactor. Upon receiving these, you must safely return to your ship to start your journey to the terror-filled space station. The space station has much greater danger. You must gather more essential supplies, but more importantly, you must disarm the reactor before it self-destructs. You have the key, but where is the reactor? Once this step of your mission has been done, you must make your way back out while trying to get past the alien attack droids, acid leaks, and more vicious beastoids.</desc>

		<desc>The inhabitants of the pretty but insignificant planet Blot decided to leave to find a trendier planet, and escape being called the Blotians, a most unhip name. Until they such a planet, they call themselves the Fuzzy Wuzzies.

Their colony ship collides with an asteroid, and crash lands in the Pacific Ocean, near an unchartered island, which they colonise, calling it "The Hippest Place in The Known Universe". Unfortunately the island is also home to rather nasty demons, who can't stand the commotion caused by the happy Fuzzies, or their silly name for the island.

The demons kidnap the Fuzzy Wuzzies by hosting a massive party, then capturing them in a net, and dragging them off to the torture chambers. The only Fuzzy not caught is Clyde Radcliff, who was already being sick in the bushes. He wakes up in the morning with a really bad headache, and fiery halitosis, and sets out to destroy the demons, and rescue his friends.

The game consists of 3 levels, each made up of 3 of stages. The first two stages of each level are side scrolling platformers, where Clyde must destroy the enemies by firing at them, presumably using his halitosis. At the end of each of these stages, Clyde meets a witch, who can provide him with extra firing patterns, or upgrade those he has, in exchange for 'magic potion creatures' found during the stages.</desc>

		<desc>Crime City is a classical point-and-click adventure. You play Mr. White, a poor chap who writes detective stories but wants nothing more than to be a real private investigator. It's a pretty classical story: one day, he can't really write a thing, but then, a mysterious blonde stands before his door, telling him his Father, Henry White, was arrested for murder. It's up to you to prove the police wrong.

A difference to the classical adventure exists: you need money to travel, get information or training. To get money, you can trade at the stock market. What's also different is that the time of the day really matters and that the protagonist becomes sleepy after staying up too long.</desc>

		<desc>This it an Amiga conversion of the classic Frogger that saw its birth in 1981. Croak 2 attempts to simulate, as accurately as possible, one of the most fascinating stages in the lifecycle of the Australian Cane Toad. As everyone knows (I didn't), the eggs of the Cane Toad are laid within the carcasses of dead sheep. The tadpoles quickly mature in this nutrient-rich environment, and soon there's a multitude of young toads, ready to begin their famous migration to the nearest creek or river bed. This journey frequently takes them across busy roads and rivers, whose erratic currents and high toxicity defy the bulky toad's best attempts at swimming.

If you can't remember, or if you have never played the game before (where have you been?), the basic idea of the game is to get your frog from one side of the road (at the bottom of the screen), over the river and into your home (at the top of the screen). To complete a level you must dodge cars and jump on logs, while avoiding snakes, alligators and otters. Bonuses are awarded for getting the bugs that momentarily appear, escorting lady frogs to their home and getting five frogs safely home.</desc>

The basic gameplay involves guiding a frog into one of 7 home-bases at the top of the screen, which have hard barriers either side of them (avoid these). This involves first guiding him across a road, avoiding the vehicles, then over a river using moving logs.

In this version the road has a variety of machinery to dodge, ranging from standard cars to lorries - hitting one kills your frog and leaves a red splodge in that part of the screen - a nice touch. The rivers also have families of turtles appearing intermittently - these can be used to cross a level, but they don't stay up for long. There's also a 2-player mode in which both players compete to get into the same slots - player 2 using a yellow frog.

You have a 60 second time limit for each frog on the first level, and 5 lives at the start. Once all 7 slots are filled, you get a 50-point bonus for each one, and move on to the next level. Progressively you have less and less time, more traffic, less logs, and a few other difficulty elements - the part in between the road and river has a chicken marching across to avoid, and a crow swoops overhead ready to grab your frog.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of William Tell is based on the TV series Crossbow which in turn is based on the Swiss national hero William Tell. The player takes the role of Tell who tries to end the reign of the evil duke Gessler.

This is an action game with puzzle elements in which Tell explores the environment, talks to people and collects everything he finds. The objects are either used to solve puzzles, are a good bribe or go into Tell's equipment. This is because the forest is no friendly environment: wild animals and Gessler's black knights want to eat/arrest him. In this case Tell has to fight his way out without losing too much life energy. It can be restored by using found provisions.

Controls are almost completely icon driven. So for example for walking right, the player needs to click the "go right" icon, to pick something up the "pick up" icon needs to be pressed and so on. This includes the fights in which first the used weapon is chosen and the combat moves are performed when clicking on the appropriate icon. The only exception is the crossbow: when using it, a first-person view replaces the icon bar in which the crossbow is aimed.</desc>

		<desc>1927. When Inspector Raoul Dusentier is invited to a cruise upon a mighty sailing ship by the wealthy businessman Niklos Karaboudjan, he looks forward to nothing but a relaxing week on the sea. Instead, his host manages to get himself killed on the second day. Murdered, to be exact. Too convenient that a policeman is aboard -- Dusentier sets out to search for suspects. He doesn't need to search long. Why is it that none of the family members seem awfully sad about the demise of the old man? Is the mysterious Father Fabiani really as pious as he says? In the tradition of Agatha Christie, each and every person on board has a motive for the murder.

Cruise for a Corpse is a graphic adventure game with a point-and-click interface.You advance in the plot not so much by solving common object-based puzzles, but by talking to the right persons about the right subjects at the right time, thus collecting clues. You will also find pieces of evidence scattered throughout the ship. However, most items suddenly appear in cupboards and drawers that were previously empty. The clock advances in ten-minute-steps whenever you discover an interesting clue, which conveniently informs you of your progress. The protagonists move around the ship; so whenever time passes, different persons to talk to might appear at certain locations.

With this game, Delphine Software's Cinematique interface reached "Evolution 2". Instead of containing a fixed number of verbs, the command menu is now context-sensitive. The mouse cursor will change its appearance when moved over an interesting object; a left-click brings up a set of appropriate verbs. For example, a cupboard may be opened and searched, whereas a key can be picked up and turned. A right-click accesses the inventory. The game features polygonal characters.</desc>

		<desc>Cruncher Factory is a Pac-Man variant. The player commands a cruncher (which looks exactly like Pac-Man) and steers him through non-scrolling labyrinths shown from the side. On every place not occupied with a wall are pills which have to be eaten by rolling over the field they are on. There are also ghosts which cause the player to lose a life when touched - at least until the cruncher eats a special ball which causes him to eat the ghosts. A level is won when all balls are eaten.

The game features 100 levels, a level editor (can be also used to change the existing levels) and a two-player mode.</desc>

		<desc>One of the Amiga's many Arkanoid clones, Crystal Hammer is perhaps best remembered by its intro tune, which has been remixed and covered by many.

The game is all about reflecting a ball against a wall of bricks. Behind the wall of bricks live some worm-like creatures that will come out to disturb you when you've opened a hole in the wall. Prolonged contact with the creatures will kill your bat. Destroying bricks will often cause a coloured brick to come spinning down slowly. These spinning bricks are power-ups, altering your ball or bat according to their colour. You can have a sticky bat (green), a wide bat (blue), a slower ball (yellow), multiple balls (cyan), and the decidedly Arkanoid-inspired shooting bat (red). Whatever you do, don't pick up the grey brick, or you will be destroyed.</desc>

A large number of different starting arrangements are offered, grouped by difficulty. Rather than having a level-based progression, you can choose any of these from the start. A number of different tunes are provided, written by Team 17 cohort Bjrn Lynne.</desc>

		<desc>Little Brad didn't believe in witches until he met one. The evil hag torments the fantasy land of Enchantia, and has just summoned Brad from the Earth as an ingredient to her potion of eternal youth. Brad doesn't like this plan. And who would be better suited to rid Enchantia of the sorceress than a tender teen?

Curse of Enchantia is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based interface. The game contains almost no text: there are no object descriptions, and the purpose of most items is apparent. In the rare occasions of interaction with other characters, symbols in balloons substitute words. If there is text on the screen, it usually consists of either signs or comic phrases.

Starting in a prison cell, Brad will have to free himself and find his way on the ocean floor, through a medieval city, a junkyard and an ice castle. The player commands Brad via an icon bar that pops up if the right mouse button is pressed. The hero can perform a variety of actions, e.g. wearing, inserting, combining or fighting. Apart from steering Brad around, there is no need to click on the screen. Brad has to stand next to the object he wants to interact with, which will then appear as an icon in the command bar. It is impossible to die in the game: in fact, doing potentially deadly things is often rewarded with funny animations.</desc>

		<desc>Four levels, no bosses, gameplay consists of monotonous trekking as many as seven screens back and forth through a barrage of respawning enemies that follow you to other screens, lasers, mines, spikes, swinging maces and mine carts to get the ever increasing amount of pods. I have no idea how anyone can survive this without an invincibility cheat, which is probably what they did to make up for the fact the game is so short. There isn't even a final boss, or any in game ending. Graphics are nothing special, but when enemies start to appear on the screen the action immediately slows down. All in all a terrible game, period!</desc>

		<desc>Predecessor to the highly succesful (and more complex) Fantasy Empires. A tactical and strategic turn-based game of robotic combat, land conquest, and city siege. This game was released by Silicon Knights in March 1992. It was voted the best multi-player game in 1992 by Computer Game Review.

Five empires descend upon the neutral and strategic planet of Orion in an attempt to claim it as their own. The days of conventional warfare are over and the age of the cybernetic warrior is at hand. The game is a mix of strategy and battle action. First it has a strategic part where you build factories, cyborgs, gain control over new countries, plan your next moves, schedule attacks and build defences. Once you and the computer have completed your turns, its time for action - attack, defence or occupation. To win the game you need to defeat the enemies with your armies of cyborgs. Size of the cyborgs varies from the smallest type called Mercury to TITAN which is the largest one available. Each of the cyborgs carry various weapons in their arsenal. The cyborgs can be controlled either by keyboard or joystick. You can issue various orders to your cyborgs before the battle begins, and set how strictly they will follow them.</desc>

		<desc>The Paranoia Complex takes place in a city controlled by a rogue computer which has its dictatorial grasp over it. The player takes the role of a citizen who has the dirty job to hunt down terrorist rebels. This simply plays out that the computer gives instructions, the player walks to the terrorist in the top-down city and shoots him. After collecting a disk from the body and bringing it to a special terminal, money and promotions wait as reward.

Money is essential because it is used to buy things like weapons, ammo or food. In regular intervals, the player has to take a personality test with yes/no answers and questions like "Are you a fascist pig?". Failing to answer correctly causes the player to become the hunted instead of the hunter.</desc>

The game is similar to Gaunlet, and levels must be completed within a time limit which changes based on level complexity. In order to complete levels, the player has to locate and collect the five crystals and then find and use the exit. Walls, enemies, and other obstacles will impede the player throughout the game and players much maintain a supply of energy units or their game will come to an end. Players can select between two characters at the start of each level. The two characters have different qualities and limitations which make them more or less adept to each different level.</desc>

The player takes on the role of one of the few survivors, with the goal of destroying the Cybercon III computer.

The gameplay of Cybercon III revolves around exploration and puzzle-solving as the player works their way through complex where the computer is stored, with the player tasked with destroying or disabling the computer and its defenses and bypassing the computer's notice, made easier by way of a secret entrance into the complex.</desc>

		<desc>You will face different opponents ranging in skills from mediocre to very tough to beat.  There are 35 opponents and six locations in the complete game. Since this is a fighting game, the object obviously is to smash the other guy. You can either beat him with your weapon until he has lost all of his energy,
or you can make it short by separating his head from the body (A Swedish shave).

Decent graphics, much better than in many commercial releases, but unfortunately animation is weak and control over the fighters is horrible. You can get used to it, but after some time it becomes tiresome. Nevertheless, if the game was a bit polished, it could have been quite good.</desc>

		<desc>Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is a shoot 'em up developed and published in 1987 by Hewson Consultants for the ZX Spectrum, and was then ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, NES, and Amiga. It was programmed by Raffaele Cecco. The Sinclair ZX Spectrum and Atari ST versions featured a main theme by Dave Rogers, while the Commodore C64 version (later released on the Wii's Virtual Console service) featured a completely different theme by Jeroen Tel.

		<desc>The follow-up to Cybernoid: The Fighting Machine is again a flip-screen shoot 'em up. In control of the deadly Cybernoid craft, your job is to rescue the cargo which has been stolen by a wave of pirate ships.

Using the range of weapon systems correctly is again a key factor. These include sideways aiming guns, bouncing bombs, 'seeker' smart bombs, bombs which move around th edge of the screen before finding a target, and time-sensitive bombs which explode a few seconds after you drop them. Shot pirate ships release cargo, and you must collect at least 1500 points of this, but on many screens it is more prudent to make an escape ASAP, as some screens have more hazards than others, and not all aliens on each screen act in the same way.</desc>

		<desc>Cyberzerk is a top-down shooter in which the player has to cleanse a big space ship from all inhabitants. This is accomplished by using either the standard gun or a limited supply of grenades. The ship consists of various levels which in itself are divided into non-scrolling rooms which are navigated by using one of the exits of the current screen. The death of every enemy - which mostly move on a set path without actively hunting the player - within a time limit is the requirement for finishing a level.

Getting hit by an enemy causes the life energy to go down and running out results in an instant game over. To counter this, energy refreshments are sometimes left behind by killed enemies. Other extras are grenades and a map which shows the layout of the current level but can be used only once. The co-operative two-player mode features friendly fire.</desc>

		<desc>Cygnus 8 is an updated version of the C64 game Star Trader (released in 1984 by Bug Byte). It's essentially a space trading game where the goal is to become rich and famous by buying and selling a variety of commodities, but it's different from most games in the genre in that your main character has a life outside his spaceship as well. He needs food and sleep, and he can do various things while visiting any of the planets in the game.

Cygnus 8 is a game which promises much but delivers little. It's not a really bad game, but it's not particularly good either, and while the first hour or so is quite entertaining, the game never really progress anywhere after that and most players will quickly lose interest.</desc>

		<desc>Viewed from above, Cytron is inspired by Paradroid and Alien Breed. The robot Cytron has been sent into a research facility in which robots have gone berserk, and it must safeguard the area and rescue the trapped scientists.

The character control is skittish, meaning that the droid is hard to stop instantly, which makes progression through the levels harder. One unusual feature is that the droid can be split into two components, Cyt and Ron, in a manner similar to Head Over Heels. This comes in useful when switches must be activated in a part of the level away from the force-field they unlock, as Cyt can be sent to flick the switch so that Ron can progress through the level as soon as it is flicked.</desc>

		<desc>The pivotal battle of World War 2 is recreated using Impressions' Micro Miniatures wargaming system. You take an overall command of the units by directing them, and can play out the individual battles yourself if you wish. The screen display uses letters to indicate the unit type, with only functional use of graphics and sound throughout.

The gameplay is turn-based, with you selecting each move for your units before activating them and letting the computer do the same. The strategic considerations include the surrounding terrain, whether the enemy forces are fortified and ready for your attack, unit morale, unit fatigue and remaining movement points. At higher difficulty levels your orders may not be followed to the letter, as the more ambitious or arrogant generals attempt their own plans.</desc>

You take control of Michael Modelcitizen and start the game with only a simple baseball bat inside his flat. Once outside you can walk around the huge city killing people (including old ladies and children), stealing better weapons and narcotics. By using different narcotics it is possible to enhance the strength of Michael's body.

Watch out for the police and the military, they will try to stop you and don't expect your baseball bat to make any impact on their equipment. If you are good enough maybe you will make it to the atom bomb in the end.</desc>

		<desc>In this sequel to the game Mercenary, the planet Eris is in danger: A comet, fittingly named "Damocles", is on a straight collision course with the planet. Within only a few hours, the comet will obliterate Eris.

It is your job to prevent this. In the maddeningly short time frame, you will have to explore the galaxy (which contains 9 planets and 19 moons) and try to find a way to stop the comet.

Just like Mercenary, you play this game in the first person perspective, this time however with detailed filled polygon graphics. You can walk on the planets, drive vehicles and fly spaceships. It is very non-linear, you can go to any planet and any moon at any time and do whatever you like. You'll have to find and use objects and examine buildings and places... and stay away from Eris if you can't destroy Damocles in time!</desc>

He is taken to their scientific satellite orbiting Venus, but it doesn't take long for Dan to break free and go down into their ship. While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an attempt to find some.

The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that get in his way using a variety of weapons, bought by using a computer terminal. Along the way, the Mekon can be seen sitting around, and destroying him will more often than not reward Dan with a pod that he needs to access the teleporter. Dan can use his jet-pack to navigate the satellite, but this will eventually run out of fuel.</desc>

		<desc>The Black Knight has brought misery to the land, and the end way to end this is to enter his haunted house to slay him. You are the brave adventurer taking on this quest through 14 increasingly-tough zones.

The bulk of the game is side-viewed, involving single screens to pass through, which incorporate ropes, cages and trapdoor. There are enemies walking, flying and hovering through this, and many of them respawn. Unusually your weapon to take them on (rocks) can be thrown through 360 degrees, which aims to make the gameplay more realistic and methodical. The screens were linked by hub screens, which the player passes through simply by clicking on a door.</desc>

		<desc>You control a squad of high-tech tanks and you have to destroy the enemy squad. The tanks can move quickly, make sharp turns or fire in all the directions.

The graphics in 3D are very well done for a 1990 game. Even if the game has a rather simplistic plot it can get quickly very addictive.</desc>

		<desc>Dark Seed is an adventure game which capitalizes on the drawings of famous horror designer H. R. Giger as a source of background artwork and inspiration.

You play Mike Dawson, an ad company manager who, in pursuit of his goal in life to become a writer, purchases a solitary mansion in a small town called Woodland Hills. Although the low cost and hush-hush transactions when purchasing the house do raise your suspicion, the solitary environment and sheer beauty of the house crush common sense and you decide to buy the house. That's when trouble begin. Upon reaching the house, you suddenly feel tired. You find a bed and fall asleep...

... and wake up from a terrible dream, only to find out that your life has just become a worse nightmare: an unknown source has implanted a seed of darkness in your mind, and you only have three days to find a way to stop it.</desc>

		<desc>Darkman was developed by Ocean Software and published by Ocean Software in 1991. 

In this side-scrolling platformer, the player controls Darkman, a superhero who can jump, kick and punch, as well as swing from a rope during action sequences between levels. In each level, Darkman disguises himself as the boss of the level, whom he must defeat before the time limit elapses. Tying into the plot of the film, Darkman wears masks of various gangsters who are responsible for his disfigurement, but his disguise dissolves after being exposed to sunlight for too long. The character changes into a different member of the evil gang in each level, taking on their attack moves as well as their face.

In-between levels, Darkman must photograph his quarry before he can make a mask of them. These scenes involve moving the cursor to take a picture of the gangster. The better the photo accuracy, the more time Darkman is granted to complete the subsequent level. The final level is the most faithful to the film, and takes place on a skyscraper under construction.</desc>

		<desc>The Gods of War, Intelligence, and Magic have created DarkSpyre, and intimidating tower full of riddles and monsters. The player takes control of an aspiring champion, whose goal is to explore the maze-like levels of the tower, retrieve five powerful runes hidden there, and ultimately save the world from destruction.

DarkSpyre a top-down "dungeon-crawling" role-playing game. The player creates the protagonist, choosing gender and magic specialization (healing or offensive), as well as customizing his/her combat parameters. The game consists of navigating the tower's complex levels (39 of them must be traversed to complete the game, though there are 50 altogether), fighting monsters in action-based combat. The protagonist can equip a variety of weapons and armor; weapons can break after excessive usage, and armor will deteriorate in quality if worn for a long time. Spells are learned from scrolls found in the tower. The hero gains weapon and magic proficiency by repeatedly using the same weapon and/or spell.</desc>

		<desc>The Sun League has been trying to fight back against the corrupted and oppressive Gar computer for many years. Now they have attacked a defense base. The only hope is for a Viper V droid to be sent in under your control to reactivate the planet's defenses.

To do this, you must find floppy disks that are everywhere in the station to reboot that evil computer! To complete this task, you must fight 33 types of little robots who attack you. The action is viewed in first-person 3D, with directional arrows on screen for movement and rotation.

There are 25 levels, each of which is automatically mapped as you explore it. Use turbolifts to get to them. Each object is managed by the game, and a notepad feature is provided to allow you to keep track of vital information.</desc>

		<desc>Death Knights of Krynn is the 2nd volume of the Dragonlance epic and is the sequel to Champions of Krynn. Characters from that game may be imported to this game.

This time the party faces an undead threat that turns former friends into fierce enemies and infests Krynn with hordes of decaying monsters. The party must find the origin of these nightmarish undead creatures and eliminate it in order to save Krynn from turning into a land of undead.

Like Champions of Krynn, Death Knights of Krynn introduces a different and unique character selection with the availability of the "Knight" class, unavailable in AD&amp;D non-Dragonlance RPGs. Characters in this game may level-up to higher levels and obtain new skills as well as more powerful spells. Experienced Knights may ultimately choose one out of 3 "clans" to focus more on a different type of fighting style.

Adventuring consists of either overland map travel or the standard 1st person town adventure. The player's party consists of 6 characters (of which one must be a Knight) as well as possible NPC characters joining your party. Wandering monsters will of course attack the party on occasion so gear up and prepare for undead monster-bashing combat!</desc>

		<desc>Doom on the 7Mhz, 16-colour, 1Mb Amiga 500 might sound unrealistic, but this is one of a handful of games that managed it, and the first full Doom-style game for the Amiga.

Unusually the multiplayer game was split-screen, which didn't really work because you could sneak a look into the other window to see where your opponent was - it's not exactly full of suspense.

The major compromises in getting the game onto the A500 are the graphics, which lack texture-mapping, and the trick-3D used where the characters don't rotate smoothly in 360 degrees, but jerk through a small range of viewpoints, a la Dungeon Master. Only half the screen is used for the actual motion as well, with the rest reserved for RPG-style artwork - which is obviously superfluous because the 2-player game doesn't have it. It's a throwback to the first Lotus game of all things. You can even turn the animation off.

In one-player mode there are 34 levels, accessed via passwords, 3 lives, and lots of powerup weapons. If one player completes the level, both advance to the next one (like Lotus 2, funnily enough. I guess I ought to think of a similarity to Lotus 3, just to complete the set). There's also the standard Death Match mode.</desc>

This is a very nice program and an excellent attempt by a Defender fan to replicate the exact arcade game on an Amiga. It is a nice addition to the Amiga arcade library, much better then Defender II, just excellent!</desc>

		<desc>Defender of the Crown puts the player in the role of one of four Saxon knights in medieval England, in a time where the land is in turmoil as the King is dead and his crown was stolen. The Saxons and the Normans blame each other and fight for control of England.

After a short introduction by Robin of Locksley himself, the game starts with a single castle and 10 soldiers at your command. From there, you have to build your army, take control of additional territories and fight and defeat the three Norman lords - and sometimes your Saxon friends as well.

In addition to the basic ' build your army and conquer your opponents' the game offers several events and options that can be used to fine tune your play style: You may engage in a jousting contest where you have to knock your opponent off his horse, gaining either fame or land, or you can go raid a castle for loot or the hand of a princess, joining your houses and territories.</desc>

		<desc>King Richard has been imprisoned on his way back from the crusades. In order to free him 20,000 pounds worth of ransom money must be gathered. Of course the nobles of the land aren't willing to give up their wealth, so this money must be obtained through tournaments, raids and outright battle against individual provinces. All of the nobles have castles, so at times siege equipment must be used.

Defender of the Crown II is the sequel to Defender of the Crown. It improves over the game by upgrading the arcade sequences. Here, unlike the original game; sword fighting is about method and is not just wild clicking of the mouse button. The siege sequence is also enhanced with different types of ammo (such as Greek fire) to toss into the castle. The jousting is now easier to control and the lance no longer bounces around wildly.

Ming the Merciless has kidnapped their children, and they set off to rescue them in this action game. As Flash you journey through the side-scrolling areas of Ming's castle, shooting your way out of trouble. You can call on the assistance of the other Defenders, who can open doors and set diversions of enemies. Quick progress through the levels is needed, as Ming's security cameras are set to detect your presence.</desc>

		<desc>The plot is also different than in the 8-bit game, as Stormlord has succeeded in his mission to free The Realm's fairies but failed to slay the wicked Queen Bahd, who managed to escape and vanished. Eventually, after many years of peace and harmony, Bahd has returned, this time in league with the Satan himself. With his help, she has again kidnapped the fairies and so Stormlord has to return and finish the job he originally set out to do. His task is to locate, free and then deliver the imprisoned fairies from Satan's Palace, through the Pits of Hell and the Enchanted Forest, to the devil-ridden skies of Heaven, where he can use the amassed power of the rescued fairy-folk to defeat the forces of evil once and for all.</desc>

		<desc>Demon's Tomb: The Awakening is a text adventure set on England on modern times. The game starts with a prologue to the rest of the game, where the player controls the main character's father while he is fighting for his life. After this brief prelude, the story jumps to 16 years-old Richard and his search for his father in Britain's moors.

The parser is on par with the one developed by Infocom. It supports chain commands and adverb recognition, and goes beyond by adding support of mouse input and interface customization. These features are enabled on a menu that pops up when right-clicking on the screen.

The optional verb menu allows complete sentence construction with the mouse. The interface can be changed to several different ways of displaying text, from a Zorkish traditional full screen output to a scrolling window.</desc>

		<desc>This game brings the US cartoon character Dennis the Menace's menacing treatment of poor old Mr. Wilson to the computer screen, around the time of the film also released in 1993. 

Dennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson&#x2019;s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. 

Some of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.

		<desc>Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf, commonly known as Desert Strike, is a shoot 'em up video game released by Electronic Arts (EA) in February 1992 for Sega's Mega Drive. The game was later released on several other formats such as the SNES, including a much upgraded version for the Amiga home computer. The game was inspired by the Gulf War and depicts a conflict between an insane Middle Eastern dictator, General Kilbaba, and the United States. The player controls a lone Apache helicopter and attempts to destroy enemy weapons and installations, rescue hostages and capture enemy personnel, while managing supplies of fuel and ammunition. The lead designer, Mike Posehn, had no video game experience prior to developing Desert Strike. Inspired by Choplifter, he aimed to create a nonlinear game with smoothly animated vehicles. Posehn, a PhD in Mechanical Engineering, developed a camera system with momentum to mimic realistic helicopter movements. Three-dimensional (3D) modeling was used to generate the vehicle sprites, which were later touched up on the pixel level with color. Desert Strike was a strong commercial success: it was a chart-topping best seller and at the time Electronics Arts' highest ever selling game. The game also received a favourable critical response, with several magazines awarding scores of over 90%. Reviewers praised the game's enjoyability, mix of action and strategy, graphics and sound. There was some controversy regarding the game's subject matter, with commentators criticising it as in poor taste due the proximity of its release to the recently ended Gulf War.</desc>

		<desc>Deuteros: The Next Millennium is the sequel to the sci-fi strategy video game Millennium 2.2, published by Activision for the Amiga and Atari ST.

While the game shares themes of space exploration and resource gathering - plus some elements of its interface - with its predecessor, the two are different in gameplay.

The object of Deuteros is to mine and manage resources, explore the Solar System and beyond. For this, 3 categories of civilians are trained: Producers, Researchers and Marines, out of a pool of 6000 population. The longer these teams are used, they are advanced in three levels, required for some later action (some inventions can be manufactured only by a producer who is at "Expert" level while Pilots with the rank of "Admiral" will be more effective in battles).

New bases built on other planets must be manned with new teams of Producers in order to construct the shuttles and derricks needed for supply. Some of these events are "milestones" which will trigger new technology to be researched by the scientists.

The player has to take care mostly of the transaction between the planets and the factories and distribute their supply with shuttles and long-range spacecraft. New technology (such as automatisation computers or teleport) will replace some of the player's involvement, as the player must later concentrate on war.</desc>

While an action/adventure hybrid using this license was released by Disney for the PC and Amiga, Titus also held a license to the movie. This is a side scrolling action game, where you control Dick Tracy as he moves through five stages, shooting gangsters with an assortment of weapons. Each stage leads to one of the mob bosses, until you ultimately capture the big man himself.</desc>

In the early 90's, two things just wouldn't die: Bruce Willis in the Die Hard trilogy of movies, and, well, 2D point-and-click shooters. Renowned software undertaker Grandslam was happily ready to dig the grave several inches deeper for both. The spade: a game called Die Hard 2: Die Harder.

Based on the 1990 movie Die Hard 2, the program sends you through five stages modelled after key scenes of the film. As N.Y. cop John McClane, you have to shoot terrorists invading Washington's Dulles airport by quickly aiming a crosshair at them. You'll successively clear the luggage center, airport annexe and runway, then chase after the bad guys on a snowmobile and finally shoot it out on the wing of the terrorist's plane. Each stage consists of three screens; on the last one, several tougher bosses will appear. Occasionally, civilians cross the room and pray that you don't kill them. Most dying terrorists drop power-ups, namely med-kits, armour, grenades and weapons that are more powerful or fire faster. You collect these items by shooting them in time. If you do not aim fast enough, the terrorist's bullets will drain your health; you may die three times, but after that, John McClane bites the dust once and for all. Until you restart, that is.</desc>

Each clan has different characteristics and stats: for example the Grablins clan resembles fantasy dwarfs and has the fastest diggers. The Quarriors clan has the strongest miners, less likely to die in a fight with enemy diggers.</desc>

		<desc>Discovery: In The Steps Of Columbus is a Strategy game, developed by Golden Sector and published by Impressions Games, which was released in Europe in 1992.

Following in the steps of Columbus? Well he didn't walk across the Atlantic did he? This game places you as a European power trying to rip off the New World as economically as possible. You go broke, game over. Quite an innovative theme.

You have four opponents who make life tough, and there's five extra scenarios for those who want to discover real new worlds. Cutesie but blocky graphics of settlements, soldiers and ships help add life to what is a management game. The map is just a wall of fog at the beginning of the game. Sending out ships to found colonies (preferably with lots of local resources) is just the start of a quite engrossing little game.

The controls are fiddly and buggy. The manual is flash but useless for learning how to play the game. For the patient, it can be absorbing, but it lacks pace. Not a patch on Pirates for playability.</desc>

The game's power-up system is worthy of note. Rather than simply picking up new weapons, or all-purpose tokens which can be traded in at the press of a button, you collect blueprints for a total of 32 different weapons as well as upgrades to the maximum amount of power your ship can unleash at a time. Once you reach a power-up bay (which are depicted as blue domes at the base of the level), you can add or remove weapons so as to maximize your attack capabilities.</desc>

		<desc>Ditris is a straight Tetris variant without gameplay additions besides a split-screen multiplayer mode. Differently shaped blocks fall from the top of the screen and can be turned and moved left and right on the way to the bottom. The goal is to create full horizontal lines which vaporize after completion: more lines at once reward more points for the high score. The next block is shown in a preview screen and the game is over when a block can't fall far enough to leave the top of the screen.</desc>

		<desc>You must control Mr. Do! as he runs and runs around each level where he is attacked by monsters.  His only weapon is his trusty crystal ball which re-bounds off any solid object such as walls or logs.  Once the ball has been used the fire power can only be restored by the collection of dots, cherries, apples, lemons or pineapples. Wherever he goes, Mr. Do! leaves a trail behind him which is indicated in the game by a line.  Occasionally in his travels Mr. Do! will cross over his own tracks and consequently the lines which indicate his trail will surround an area.  When this happens all dots and fruit inside the area will change into more valuable fruit and a higher score will be obtained when the dots and fruit are collected.  This enables Mr. Do! to re-charge his firepower more rapidly.

To complete each screen, Mr. Do! must destroy all the monsters or collect all the dots. Mr. Do! does have an advantage over many of the monsters.  He can travel up and down the slopes linking the levels much more quickly than some of the monsters.  The advantage gained might well give Mr. Do! all the seconds he needs.</desc>

		<desc>Dominator is a classic shooter game. You're in control of a small spaceship and have once again to save the earth from alien attack. You have to maneuver your craft through small passages while under permanent attack.

The first level is a vertical shooter level with your ship only in its basic configuration. The later levels are horizontal scrolling and there you get your chance to improve your efficiency by collecting various power up ranging from speed-ups to tail cannons.

Typically, each stage has a final boss who needs a lot of firepower to be beaten.</desc>

		<desc>Donald Duck's Playground won several awards from educational software magazines as best educational game of the year. In it, you are Donald, working to earn money, which you then spend to buy playground equipment for your nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie to enjoy.

The first job is to guide the Amquack Express around a top-down map with 8 stations, setting the junctions to ensure that packages are delivered to the correct stations. His job in produce involves catching fruits as they are thrown at him and placing them in the correct basket. At the toy store he must sort items by shape and colour, and be careful with the security switch. His final job is at an internal US airport, soring products based on their location's delivery code.

The equipment for the playground must then be purchased and arranged, helping young minds get an appreciation of money management and cash-handling.</desc>

Once you collect the target quota of gems, you must escape from each level through one of its many exits, giving the game a similar structure to Alien Breed: Tower Assault. Magical powers can be collected along the way, including the ability to turn into an inflatable toy duck, which makes it possible to float across water. There is a simultaneous split-screen 2-player mode included as well.</desc>

		<desc>Donkey Kong is a Platform game and unofficial Amiga conversion of Donkey Kong by Nintendo. Game is developed and published by Bignonia as a shareware, which was released in 1993.

Back in 1993, a shareware company called Bignonia ported Donkey Kong from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga. The final product closely resembled the arcade original in terms of graphics and levels (it includes the elusive pie factory stage). While the game is missing the between-level &#x201C;How High Can You Go?&#x201D; screens, it did add an extra stage that seemed to make some decent use out of the game physics.

You are Mario, and that big old gorilla, Donkey Kong, has run off with your girlfriend. It's up to you to struggle up those ladders and balance on those beams to rescue your lady fair. She's held captive at the very top. But Donkey Kong is not ready to give her up so easily. He's tossing barrels and fireballs at you at every turn. It's up to you to outmaneuver that wily ape. Good luck, your lady awaits!</desc>

The game unusually scrolls from right to left, with the dog simply following you. The platforms are often on different levels, providing multiple routes through the game. Most hazards in the game can be shot, but others can be avoided by jumping. A number of bonus weapons and other enhancements are on offer.</desc>

		<desc>Double Agent is an enhanced clone of well known 8-bit computers hit Spy vs. Spy. The game features numerous mission where the player competes with another human player or computer in the execution of the assignment. The tasks require carrying out specific actions before opponent, f.e. retrieve documents and escape from the building, find a camera and make photographs, kill other agent. In each location various items (heavy ball, electrical device, lit cigar) can be found that can be used for setting creative booby traps inside plants, desks, file cabinets and other furniture. All traps can be disarmed with objects found in the rooms. Contact with a trap takes some of the energy. Another difficulty is the third agent that appears after some time pledging traps and attacking the other two. Each agent has a shotgun, which can be used against the enemy. Death means the loss of all items and moves the agent to the initial position.</desc>

		<desc>Set in a post-apocalyptic New York, Double Dragon is the story of Billy and Jimmy Lee, twin brothers trained in the fighting style of Sou-Setsu-Ken. Together, they manage a small martial arts training school, teaching their students in self-defense. One day, Billy's girlfriend, Marian, is kidnapped off the street by the "Black Warriors", a savage street gang led by a man named Willy. The Black Warriors demand the Lee brothers disclose their martial arts secrets in exchange for Marian's freedom. The Lee brothers set out on a rescue mission to crush the Black Warriors and save Marian.

Using whatever techniques they have at their disposal, from the basic punches and kicks to the invulnerable elbow strike, as well any weapon that comes into their hands, the Lee brothers must pursue the gang through the city slum, industrial area and the forest before reaching their hideout to confront the big boss, Willy.</desc>

Billy and Jimmy Lee are returning from martial arts training when their paths cross a fortune teller. She tells them of a great evil in Egypt, their strongest adversary yet, and how the Rosetta Stones can aid them.

This game features weapon shops where Billy and Jimmy can buy power-ups, tricks, energy and extra lives to aid them in their quest.

Power-ups make Billy and Jimmy twice their size, increasing their damage done and range of attack.

The character graphics have changed, moving away from cartoon style graphics to more realistic looking characters.</desc>

Gameplay is entirely action, so no time needs to be spent customizing the teams or with statistics. You control each player on the team one at a time (the player with or about to receive the ball will be human controlled, with the computer taking over the other players temporarily.) Some versions feature a small amount of digitized sound effects, and close ups of slam dunks.</desc>

		<desc>Kayus became the King of the Agamen Empire when he was just 15 years old. Those who were dissatisfied with his enthronement conspired to break the seal confining the King of Darkness, Zambaquous, to seize the kingdom with the black power. Thus, wind was filled with miasma and the ground rotted, gradually turning into darkness. Young King Kayus must stop the return of darkness together with the dragon of light, Bahamoot.</desc>

		<desc>Princess Alicia of the kingdom of Mitgult is kidnapped by the monster Zawell. It's now up to the heroic warrior Amul to transform himself into a blue dragon and go and rescue the princess.

Dragon Spirit is a vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which consists of nine stages. Players fly around and destroy everything in their path. Much like in Xevious, action takes place on two planes, both in the sky (where the dragon is flying) and on the ground. The dragon has two different kind of attacks: fire that shoots up the screen, and fire that drops to hit a place on the ground in front of the dragon. Enemies exist both in the air and on the ground, and some can fly up from the ground to the sky.

Players can pick up power-ups, or upgrades, that will help them in their fight. Upgrades can include extra heads on the dragon, health, faster shots, and more. At the end of each stage is a boss that needs to be defeated. Having good upgrades that are not lost from being hit before reaching the bosses will help.

The NES version is unique in that it presents a somewhat altered story and an additional gameplay mode. Technically, it is a sort of sequel, with "A New Legend" being its subtitle. In this version, Zawell is already defeated and King Amul and his now wife Queen Alicia, have two children named Iris (a princess) and Lace (a prince). A new evil named Galda has decided to attack the Earth. Galda also has taken Iris captive and now Lace must go rescue her.

The NES version also adds a new initial stage. If the player survives it, the game continues in a "Blue Dragon" game much like the original arcade game. If the player fails to clear this initial stage in one life, an easy mode called "Gold Dragon" begins, skipping about half the game's stages, giving the player extra hit points, and features a different ending.

Also of note, the TurboGrafx-16 version's seventh and eighth stage are different than the other versions. The underwater and dark themed stages were changed to castle interior themed stages.

		<desc>A variant on Shanghai, the ancient Chinese tile game, released when the official Amiga version was long unavailable.

A number of different types of tile are used, with 4 of each. These are arranged in a particular way, with some on top of others and some next to them. The idea is to remove pairs of tiles progressively so as to leave none remaining. However, a tile can only be moved if it has nothing on top of it, and has free space to either the left or right of it.

This version has 18 different tile layouts, and the tiles have modern pictures on them, ranging from Ghostbusters and Batman logos to computer chips and patterns of atoms, which makes the tiles more disttinct and colourful, and takes the game out of its old-fashioned context.</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Tiles: The Tournament is a sequel to the original Dragon Tiles and like that game it is a mahjong solitaire game like Shanghai. The objective of the game is to remove tiles from a stack by matching tiles with the same emblem. Only tiles that have an empty place at either their left or right side can be removed. The main difference from the original game is that it's not only possible to remove two tiles at a time but also sets of four, six or eight tiles. The more tiles that are removed at a time the more points will the player earn. Another difference from the first game is that the play field is larger than the screen size which means that the display scrolls when the mouse cursor is moved.

The game consists of 75 levels and space for 25 more that can be created with a built-in level editor. The appearance of the game can be customized with different tile types: crystal, stone, wood and copper. There are also different emblem sets to choose from: the ones from the original game, as well as flags, runes, Chinese symbols and cards.</desc>

Due to limitations of the computers at the time, this conversion of the coin-op arcade game, Dragon's Lair only features the first half of the game, which consists of entering Singe's Castle and encountering the dragon. The adventures are continued in a second part which completes the conversion of the arcade game.

Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.</desc>

		<desc>After adapting the original Dragon's Lair into two different games, Readysoft continued with the arcade sequel.

Dirk the Daring is called back into action when his wife Daphne is kidnapped by the evil wizard Mordroc. Encouraged by Daphne's mother (and her rolling pin), Dirk escapes to Singe's old castle, where he finds a time machine, which will take him to different eras and dimensions on the search for his wife.

Dragon's Lair II: Time Warp for home computers adapts parts of stages 1 (escape from Daphne's mother), 2 (prehistoric times), 4 (Garden of Eden), 7 (confrontation with Mordroc) and 8 (final escape) from the arcade game. Gameplay is close to the original - scenes run automatically and the player has to press the right button at the right time (either moving or using Dirk's sword) or die, albeit without the flashing prompts present in the coin-op. All scenes from the original animated film are completely redrawn to fit the limitations of the 16-bit machines.</desc>

The protagonist has to ride a dragon, find 40 artifacts and bring them to the corresponding places. The artifacts can only be dropped at the correct location.

Of course there are enemies which try to stop the player and can be destroyed by using the dragon's fire breath. Besides the artifact collecting, the game plays out as a traditional multi-directional scrolling shooter. There are five levels with eight artifacts each.</desc>

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</desc>

Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</desc>

		<desc>Dream Zone is an adventure video game developed by JAM Software, later known as Naughty Dog, and published by Baudville. The game was released in 1987 for the Apple IIGS and then ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS.
Compute! stated that the game "truly conveys a dream-like feeling". The magazine praised its satire and the IIGS version's graphics, and stated that "it's hard to believe that the program was written by two high school juniors".[3] A later Compute! review praised the graphics, story, and interface.[4] The game was reviewed in 1988 in Dragon #134 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars.[2]

The game sold upwards of 10,000 copies, earning the developers about $15,000.[1]</desc>

		<desc>In the far future, the human race has abandoned Earth for the reaches of outer space, having ruined the planet in the relentless quest for resources and in endless conflict. In a desperate search to find a new home, they found Evath, a life-sustaining planet with two moons, Mitral and Tricuspid. They sent a ship, named "Exodus" to colonize this new planet with explorers, embryos and supplies. Generations passed, and the colony on Evath was formed. Without the rule of law, the oldest members of the Exodus' crew, the Elders, were forced to take control, form an army and bring the rule of law to Evath.

Lesleigh Skerrit aspired to work for the Driller Federation. His grandfather had been a member of the Federation, but he was falsely accused of murder and banished as a Ketar. Only later did the evidence contesting his guilt surface, but it was too late - the law did not allow someone banished as a Ketar to return to Evath. Lesleigh was not bitter and did not seek retribution. He wanted to study law to prevent this kind of mistake happening again.

Called in by his superior, Montigue Yarbro, he is offered a lifetime opportunity - to complete his training and gain a promotion to Elite within the Driller Federation in one fell swoop. His experience on Mitral bore him well - he was to go to Mitral and attempt to avert the coming catastrophe. Mitral, having been abandoned in its unstable state by the Ketars, was going to explode within four hours, and the explosion would take Evath with it. Skerrit's mission was to use the excavation probe "Last Hope" to place eighteen drilling rigs around Mitral to allow the gas to dissipate harmlessly into space and prevent this disaster. Things are not so simple though, with the security systems activated prior to the Ketars' departure.</desc>

		<desc>This game follows the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his three nephews, Huey, Dewey and Louie.

The aim of the game is shown in the introduction. Flintheart Glomgold challenges Scrooge to a competition to see who the richest duck in the world is. They each have 30 days to see who can get the most money together and finally their dispute will be settled.

Scrooge&#x2019;s office is your headquarters. Here you have three options &#x2013; you can go exploring for treasure, play the stock market or dive into your money bin, occasionally finding a rare coin which adds to you treasure total. You need to get some money first before you can play the stock market though.

You main source of income comes from the exploration map which hangs on the wall. From here, you can pick a destination, which you can travel to. There are four different scenarios when travelling to various parts of the world. It&#x2019;s these levels that are the most fun. You can choose to go mountain climbing, jungle bashing, search a cavern, or photograph some rare animals depending on your location. On screen information tells you which scenario it is, how long the trip will take and how much the treasure is worth. There&#x2019;s also an island in the Indian Ocean you can visit to check on who&#x2019;s winning between you and Glomgold.

You have to fly to each location and your transport is LaunchPad McQuack! You have to take off at the airport and fly to the destination. There are obstacles along the way though, watch out for powerlines (these are really funny, you run into them and boing! bounce back); hot air balloons dropping refrigerators, anvils, 10 ton weights and pianos; cumulo nimbus clouds shooting lightening and fluffly clouds; whales blowing water out their spouts; tall mountains, rocky outcrops, fireworks, hay barns among other things. Landing on the other side requires a special skill &#x2026; Launchpads! You have to crash into the airport to land! Crash the plane though and it takes two days of your valuable time limit for Gyro Gearloose to fix it.

Using Huey, Dewey and Louie, each being one of your three lives in the mountain climbing level, you must get from the base of the mountain to the top to get your treasure. Using the boys, you can hop from ledge to ledge, or when the going gets tough, use your grappling hook! This is a lot of fun and requires precision. There are also caves in the side of the mountain, which can transport you up or down the mountain. But watch out for bears in the caves. Other obstacles i</desc>

		<desc>Based on the legendary Frank Herbert novel of the same name and visually inspired by the 1984 David Lynch movie, Dune is a strategy-adventure hybrid where the player takes the role of young Paul Atreides, the son of Duke Leto. The Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV has given the Atreides House the rights to manage the extraction of the most precious substance in the entire universe - the Melange, commonly known as Spice in the desolate desert planet Arrakis (Dune), the only place in the universe capable of producing the substance. While everything indicates the offer is a trap orchestrated by their enemies the Harkonnen, the Atreides family agrees on moving, as he who controls the spice, controls the universe.</desc>

		<desc>Dune II is often considered the first mainstream modern real-time strategy game and established many conventions of the genre. Even though set in Frank Herbert's famous Dune universe, the game is only loosely connected to the plot of any of the books or the films based from them. Controlling either of the three Houses, the player must fight a number of battles against the other Houses. In the early levels, the goal is simply to earn a certain number of credits, while in the later missions, all enemies must be destroyed.

The single resource in the game is the Spice, which must be collected by harvesters. The spice is converted to credits in a refinery, which are then spent to construct additional buildings and units. There are two terrain types: buildings can only be constructed on stone, while the Spice is only found on sand. However, units moving on sand attract the large sandworms of Dune, who are virtually indestructible and can swallow even large units whole. As levels progress, new and more advanced buildings and units are made available, including structures like a radar station, a repair facility or defense turrets and, for units, various ground troops, light vehicles and tanks. Each House can construct one unique special unit, and, after building a palace improvement, can unleash a unique palace effect.</desc>

		<desc>Dungeon Master is a role-playing game where the player selects four adventurers and descend into the depths of the dungeon. The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale. However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.</desc>

		<desc>Dyna Blaster or Dynablaster is a name that has been given to the European releases of the game of the Bomberman. It's a strategic, maze-based video game franchise originally developed by Hudson Soft.

Most games in the Bomberman franchise largely revolve around two modes of play; single player campaigns where the player must defeat enemies and reach an exit to progress through levels, and multiplayer modes where players must attempt to eliminate each other and be the last one standing. Gameplay involves strategically placing down bombs, which explode in multiple directions after a certain amount of time, in order to destroy obstacles and kill enemies and other players. The player can pick up various power-ups, giving them benefits such as larger explosions or the ability to place more bombs down at a time. The player is killed if they touch an enemy or get caught up in a bomb's explosion, including their own, requiring players to be cautious of their own bomb placement.</desc>

		<desc>Side-scrolling beat 'em ups in which you must rescue a trapped female friend are nothing unusual. Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.</desc>

		<desc>Originating in the arcades, Dynasty Wars is a beat-em-up set during the Three Kingdoms Era of the Chinese history, and is, more specifically, based on the Tenchi o Kurau manga adaptation of the story. The player adopts the identity of an ancient Chinese warrior, and riding on horseback has to eliminate all his opponents, mostly infantry and archers.

The game uses a lateral scroll and the player can move in all four directions. A novelty is the attack system: when pressing fire the energy of the attack will load up as the warrior moves his weapon up and backwards, in order to gain momentum. The more the player can keep fire pressed, the more powerful the attack will be. In addition, so-called "tactics" can be used at specific moments; these are powerful area attacks that deplete the protagonist's HP in process and range from summoning an ambush partner and causing rocks slide down slopes.

Stages typically culminate in boss battles. Along the way, various power-ups can be collected. Besides treasure that increases the player's score, and food packs that heal the protagonist, there are also yellow and blue orbs, which represent the game's light RPG elements: yellow orbs count as experience points and increase the character's vitality after a stage is over, and blue orbs increase the power of his weapon.</desc>

		<desc>In Dyter-07, Earth is attacked by alien forces. The player mans the advanced attack chopper Dyter-07 to drive them back and rescue scientists on the way. The game has eight levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. For each of the four tropical islands, the surface has to be cleared at first by flying around in a side-scrolling perspective, reminiscent of Choplifter. Alien opposition can be destroyed by shooting them, but after six hits the helicopter gets destroyed.

The basic goal is to destroy a number of robots which are found by using the radar. However, the chopper is not able to destroy those; that's why it carries the Battledroid, a tank. When the chopper lands, the tank is detached and can be driven over the surface of the island. A side effect of destroying the robots is the rescue of human scientists which are held hostage in said robots. They can be picked up with the helicopter and brought to the base. While this is not required to finish the level, rescued scientists net vital upgrades like better weapons, a better shield or the ability to move underwater. All those upgrades can be either applied to the chopper or the tank.

After all robots are destroyed, a volcano opens up and the player moves right in. In the following section the game transforms into a vertically scrolling shooter. Gameplay in these sections is traditional, save for the fact that the player travels downwards from the upper part of the screen: dodging enemy bullets and shooting as many aliens as possible until the level end boss is reached and defeated. An upgraded chopper is important to survive these levels.</desc>

		<desc>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</desc>

		<desc>Crime is getting out of control in Liberty City, and to combat the problem, the LCPD establishes a new unit, called ESWAT (Enhanced Special Weapons and Tactics). Police officers who are promoted to this unit wear a cyber-suit that contains state-of-the-art military equipment including two Turbo-Booster Thrusters, extra ammunition, and increased protection. In order to become an ESWAT member, all a dedicated police officer has to do is arrest enough criminal masterminds to progress through the ranks, which include Captain, Assistant Chief, and Chief.

ESWAT: Cyber Police is a horizontal-scrolling beat 'em up where you have to make your way from left to right and defeat a mastermind. There are 15 stages to complete, and have you patrolling through Liberty streets, car yards, stadiums, restaurants, the CBD, construction sites, and boat docks. While you're out on patrol, you can pick up ammunition, and the amount you get varies. For example, on some levels, ammo may be worth 10 bullets, while in others, you may get 60 bullets. Once you have obtained the cyber-suit, you wear it for the duration of the game.</desc>

		<desc>E.T's Rugby League is fondly remembered by gamers of the era and for many would still represent the pinnacle of rugby league video games. While at its heart E.T's Rugby League is just World Class Rugby with the six tackle rule, adding a play the ball and removing two players per side takes the experience from good to great. You get more room to throw the ball around, offloading becomes even more deadly, half breaks are more frequent and your joystick lives a longer, happier life for not being violently waggled every ten seconds.</desc>

		<desc>Eco is an action strategy game of sorts, which sets the player in charge initially of a small single-celled organism and challenges the player to guide its evolution.

The initial tasks are to roam around finding food and then find a potential mate. Depending on the organism's status, different predators will be after it - a radar is displayed to indicate where these are at any given time. Once this is done, the player is taken to a screen displaying the species' genes, and has the chance to modify one of them, thus resulting in evolution. Eventually the organism can evolve far enough to become plant, insect, fish, or even human.</desc>

		<desc>Cornelius the Elf was living peacefully in a forest with his sweetheart Elisa. However, an evil creature known as Necrilous the Not-Very-Nice kidnapped Elisa and disappeared with her. Cornelius must embark on a perilous journey to rescue the love of his life.

Elf is a platform action game with light adventure elements. Cornelius is armed with a ring that fires projectiles at enemies. During the course of the game he can collect herbs and animals (called "pets"), which can be traded in shops for upgrades such as stronger attacks, extra speed, magic spells, or devices such as a flying machine. In addition, certain segments require the player to communicate with NPCs populating the game world and fulfill their requests, usually by obtaining specific items for them. 

The game keeps track of the player character's behavior, assigning the player a rating and affecting the ending scene depending on the protagonist's actions, which mainly involve killing or sparing the lives of the game's non-hostile characters. The protagonist's health is measured in hearts and lives, which can be replenished or increased. The player can save the game between stages.</desc>

To buy more expensive and stronger characters, the player collects gold coins as a reward for beating enemies.</desc>

		<desc>Long, long ago, in the dim and distant past when 8 bit machines ruled the Earth, Messers Braben and Bell conceived and coded what was to become one of the greatest computer games of our time - Elite. BBC Micro users everywhere abandoned their chores, hobbies and wives in search of the adrenalin buzz as man and machine became one in the inter-galactic adventure of the decade. Until today, Electronic Art's Interceptor was the only Amiga game to come close to the addictive atmosphere of Elite. Now the ultimate is available on the ultimate home computer - and it's great!

Elite is a trading/combat game of mammoth proportions - the playing area covers eight separate galaxies and more than 2,000 planets, each having its own political and economic structure. Such information is of little consequence when playing a pure zap and blaster like Galactic Conqueror, but for anyone hoping to make a name for himself in the galaxy it is a must.

The ladder to success in Elite is eight rungs long - you begin with a rating of Harmless and progress through the ranks of the Dangerous and Deadly until you finally join the small number of pilots who make it to become Elite.

Your rating increases in relation to the number of kills you notch up on your travels. These may be good guys or bad guys, they all count as kills. The only disadvantage of blasting the goodies is the effect that this has upon your legal status. Following a few indiscretions your status will be adjusted to read Offender or even Fugitive, which has undesirable consequences when wishing to dock at space stations in law abiding systems. It is not uncommon for a fleet of police Vipers to form an unwelcoming committee.

The base model Cobra Mk3 is hardly a ship to put the fear of Zarquon into a battle-hardened space pirate, enter the trading aspect. Data can be called up for any planet in the current galaxy - the two most important items to note are the planet's Tech Level and the Government type.

On a technically advanced planet the price of food and textiles is high, but the cost of computers is low, the reverse being true for a planet with a low Tech Level. All you have to do is find two such planets in close proximity to each other and satisfy their respective economic needs. The planet's political stability determines how much hassle you will get from pirates. Democratic planets have relatively small pirate populations in comparison to the fleets of fighters that you will encounter when visiting an Anarchic</desc>

		<desc>Elvira II: The Jaws of Cerberus is an adventure/RPG first-person game. You begin by choosing one of the four classes for your character (which determines your starting attributes, such as Strength, Intelligence etc.).

For movement, you click the arrows in the bottom-right corner of the screen. Collecting items can be done via clicking on them in the first-person view window and dragging them into your inventory. (You can also click the "room" icon to see all the items that you've found in the room so far.) Should you encounter monsters, you fight by clicking on them. You can choose one of the four tactics (Normal, Defense, Fierce, Berserk) when fighting, and there's a number of different weapons you can find in the game. If you meet someone who doesn't want to murder you (a very rare occurrence) you can talk to him, though conversations are pretty simple and consist mainly of short phrases.

As you defeat monsters, explore the game world and cast spells (see below), you get experience. Once you have enough experience, you gain a level, and your attributes improve.

Thanks to Elvira's spellbook she gave you, you have the ability to create and cast spells. Some spells can be used to heal yourself, protect you in combat or damage your enemies, other are necessary to solve certain puzzles and make progress in the game. Creating a spell requires you to be of high enough level and to have the proper ingredients, different for every spell. The ingredients are usually gone forever once the spell is ready, so beware and don't use up any items vital for completing the game! Casting a spell requires you to use some amount of Power Points (PP), which regenerate automatically but slowly. What's more, you only get a limited number of castings when you prepare a spell, so don't waste them.</desc>

		<desc>Europe 390 A.D. - the Migration Period: As the Western Roman Empire struggles to repel migrating Germanic tribes fleeing from the incursion of the Huns into Eastern Europe, several of its provinces are breaking away seeking independence.

In "Elysium", you rule one of these independent provinces. Your goal is threefold: (1) survive politically until the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 A.D.; (2) make your country the most livable for your people, turning it into an "Elysium", an island of the blessed in those turbulent times; (3) (optionally) build an empire of your own by conquering other provinces.

Your challenges are firstly foreign and secondly domestic: ward off pillaging barbarian tribes such as the Vandals or the Huns and defend against legions of Roman troops sent by the Emperor to forcibly reintegrate you into his failing Empire. This requires building, equipping and maintaining a whole army of militia, career soldiers and mercenaries, financed by a vibrant domestic economy. Thus your tasks at home include the production of agricultural and other goods and building the necessary infrastructure, trade by sea and land, law enforcement and taxation, and most importantly: stay in power by keeping the masses happy with "bread and circuses".</desc>

		<desc>A very long time ago, aliens planted a few offsprings on Earth's ocean grounds until they grow strong. However, humanity wakes them from their sleep with atomic tests and therefore a big war. The player mans a futuristic fighter plane to drive them back during 20 missions. While the cockpit perspective with relatively detailed information prompts and the open locations remind of simulation games, this is a pure shooter.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the classic Boulder Dash game. The player is deep down in a cave and have to collect emeralds and diamonds while evading monsters - and the laws of gravity, which have the annoying habit of squishing him with huge rocks if he happens to stand beneath one as it falls down.

The game also has a two-player mode where two people can rid caves of their valuables at the same time - in addition to the 80 levels, there are 20 exclusive two-player levels.</desc>

		<desc>Emerald Mine II is an Boulder Dash variant and features no gameplay changes in comparison to its predecessor besides the new level editor. The player's goal is to collect diamonds which are surrounded by dirt. When walking over an dirt spot, it is cleared and an stone above it will fall down - with unhealthy results if the player or a monster is hit by it. Other items are dynamite to clear out boulders and keys for certain doors.

The need to plan ahead and find out the required steps to reach the diamonds give the game a puzzle-solving character. Besides the about hundred levels in single-player, there are additional levels for two players.</desc>

		<desc>Empire is a simulation of a global conflict between two to three implacable foes. No compromise is possible, each must strive to annihilate the other. The war is conducted over a large map, with land, sea and cities on it. Each player manipulates his armies, fighters and ships to try and smash the others, to reach the goal of total domination of the world. Empire is not a video arcade-type game. It is a thinking man's game, as it requires strategy and tactics instead of hand-eye coordination.</desc>

		<desc>Enchanted Land is set in the peaceful land of Damiran. But as it is in video games, an evil wizard stops by and takes over. In this case, he broke the heart of wisdom and the only way to bring the story to a good end is to collect the pieces from the five levels of this game. The protagonist is the magician Kurgan who jumps through the multi-directional scrolling platform levels.

A big boss stands at the end of each level, but defeating him is not enough to get access to the next: the hidden parts of the heart need to be found first. Besides platforming, there are are lot of enemies to fight. To do so, the magician has twelve weapons at his disposal which need a certain amount of energy to use. Just like the other two bars (jumping and life energy) it can be refilled by collecting crystals.</desc>

		<desc>Featuring the English national squad in a top-down soccer game, England Championship Special represents British publisher Grand Slam's attempt to cash in on both England's respectable semi-final entry at the 1990 World Cup and the popularity of Anco's acclaimed Kick Off series.

Mimicking Kick Off in style and perspective, European Championship Special is geared towards high-speed play at bottom-level complexity, with only one action key for kicks and slides and heads. No cards and hardly any penalties, primitive AI and straightforward gameplay make for goals galore, and the weather system turns out to be wind velocities only, which turns out don't affect the ball at all.</desc>

		<desc>Eskimo Games takes the winter sports multi-event format and emphasises the winter rather than the sports. Operation Snowball is similar to the arcade game Cabal insofar as it resembles Operation Wolf but adds a roll manoeuvre. You must fire snowballs at people who are trying to make a catapult, and destroy the shots they aim at you.

Eggsterminator places you at the top of a cliff, which has 5 ledges containing a bird's nest. Birds will periodically land on these and lay eggs, which you must collect. Contact with the birds themselves causes you to fall and lose time. Ice N'Igloos involves using your axe to collect ice, and taking it to your incomplete igloo to complete it. Avoid the seals, as contact with these costs you time.

Miami Ice is a clone of Tapper, except that instead of beer you are serving ice cream to people. From one side of the screen you must ensure that each line has enough ice creams sent down it to match the number of people coming. Also ensure that you are ready to collect the empty cones when these are returned. Evidently, the taste of wafers is not popular near the poles.

The final event is not present on the C64. It is Barbearian, a one-on-one fight with a polar bear. The ice melting away sets the time limit in this game.</desc>

		<desc>The 1992 olympic games took place in Barcelona, Spain, and the corresponding computer game came from Ocean: The Games '92 - Espaa. The sports simulation boasts an impressive variety of diciplines, divided into three sections:

Track and Field: running, relay, hurdles, steeplechase, discus, shot putt, hammer throw, javelin, long jump, triple jump, high jump, pole vault;
Water Sports: free style, breast stroke, back stroke, butterfly, relay, diving;
Fighting: boxing, wrestling, judo, fencing.

Eliminating the different distances in single events (such as 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle), though, The Games' "over 30 events" melt down to 22; and counting only those which differ to some degree in their execution, it boils down to six: running, throwing, jumping, swimming, diving and fighting.

The Games '92 is divided in three parts: During preparation time, manage and train twelve athletes by sentencing them to gym time and daily practice. Game time advances with each action until the olympic games begin.
In pactice, heats and finals, you take control of your athletes and drive them to peak performances through rhythmical tapping of the cursor keys, and the occasional press of the space bar.
In the database section, you can read up on previous games and winning athletes, and take a look at Barcelona location maps.</desc>

		<desc>The game represents the most powerful European teams of 1992 season. England, Germany, Scotland, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, France, and Sweden propose the best teams of their premier divisions such as Bayern Mnchen, Manchester United, Celtic, Ajax, AC Milan, Real Madrid, FC Barcelona, Monaco, IFK Gteborg, etc. for player's choice.

Gameplay flows in side view, where soccer players are controlled either by human or CPU. There are two modes of playing. The first one is "Friendly match" for 2 players (playable only if a joystick is installed along with keyboard). The second one is "Euro Cup tournament" for 1 player. Different options such as match length (2/4/6/8 minutes), weather conditions (wet/dry), formation of the teams (4-4-2/4-3-3/4-2-4), and national anthems (on/off) may be adjusted.

Simulation of the players` team actions lies in the following. When the ball is near the player of your team, this player is selected as active and becomes controllable. As this player you should run to the player of the opposite team and take the ball, after that you may run with the ball, which is stuck to your feet, give a pass to another player of your team, or strike the ball. Your player may be moved in 8 directions. Your goalkeeper keeps your gates by himself. Camera follows the ball but with some delay, so the ball is often not in the center of the playscreen as well as nearest player of your team is not visible.

There is no ability to save the game in progress. So tournament should be played from the very beginning 'til the end during a single game session.</desc>

		<desc>Tecmo's World Cup '90 arcade game was remodeled based on the 1992 European Championships for its home computer release. The tournament's structure of the time (2 groups of 4 play each other once, top 2 go through to semi-finals followed by a final) is recreated, with any of Europe's soccer nations available to be chosen as those 8, and 1 or 2 human players choosing their team, playing on either keyboard or joystick.

The matches are played from a side-scrolling perspective. The ball sticks to the player's foot, and can be kicked or passed with a press of the fire button. The referee is fairly lenient when it comes to tough sliding tackles, although fierce contact will result in a free kick being given.</desc>

		<desc>European Football Champ was released to coincide with the 1992 European Championships. The game scrolls horizontally at a slight angle, and recreates the coin-op's close-up zoom effect after a player scores. Only a small area of the pitch is on screen at a time, but there is a scanner to show the whole pitch.

Although the game has a referee, he often loses attention, and these moments give you a chance to foul, punch or side-swipe opposition players. One and two player options are included.</desc>

		<desc>A simple little game that is a later reworking of the ancient game, Thrust. With the full effects of gravity and Newtonian physics in action to make control more challenging, you fly around a side-scrolling level shooting enemies and avoiding contact with the scenery.

There are a few additional twists. You must collect bits of a key (which you need to be able to kill the baddie at the end), and pick up prisoners (whom you can then torture to learn the whereabouts of other bits of the key). There's also a shop where you can sell your prisoners as slaves (provided you haven't tortured them to death) in return for powerups for your ship.</desc>

		<desc>Explorer is a timed puzzle board game. The player takes the role of a gold digger, named John Smith. His goal is to collect all the gold pieces on the board before the time runs out. To do so the player must appropriately push the crates blocking the road, use teleporters and generators of matter forming bridges over the abyss. Some of the fields are mined or marked as non-stopping area (requires two blocking crates next to it to remove the effect). The remaining time after the completion of the board is rewarded with additional points. The game features 60 levels all together. After each completed board the player receives a password.</desc>

		<desc>Eye is closely based on the board game with the same name. The game is played with two to four players on a board with differently coloured squares. Each player has playing stones of one colour and the goal to get a certain amount of the own stones on the corresponding fields. The spin on this concept is that the board is placed on two rotatable spirals which change the square distribution on the field when used. During each turn, a player has a different amount of moves available (changes depending on the current match situation); each move consisting of moving a square or turning a spiral. This computer version also allows some rule modifications in comparison to the original game and all opponents can be replaced by the AI.</desc>

There are various scenarios for each, with air-to-air or ground missions, in "cold war" and full-scale war situations. Players can build up their pilot ranks through completed missions and medals.  The game actually has two flight modes. In the "authentic" mode, you have only 2 weapon bays, but you have higher stealth rating. In the "theoretical" mode, you have 4 weapon bays like F-19 Stealth Fighter, but your plane is easier to detect due to a lower stealth rating.</desc>

		<desc>True to the aircraft's flexibility, you pilot the F-16 in assignments as diverse as dogfights, bombing raids or reconnaissance missions. It is up to you to plan your flight route by setting waypoints on the tactical map prior to take-off; you can also (but need not) select the armament of your plane. When you have accumulated enough flight experience, you may command entire squadrons in the fictional Operation Conquest campaign, a simple simulation of an entire war theater that already hinted at what would later become DI's Virtual Battlefield.</desc>

The game is set in the Bay Area; you can either just fly around, perform several maneuvers, or fly one of six missions that are set in the Cold War. In those missions, you have to protect the president's Air Force One, intercept enemy aircraft, rescue a downed pilot, and save the city of San Francisco from being blasted into oblivion by a nuclear cruise missile.</desc>

		<desc>F1 is an Official Formula One Racing Game. There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.

There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.

F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.</desc>

		<desc>F1 Tornado is a flight combat game played from a first person perspective unlike the 8-bit game with the same name which is a side scrolling game. The game contains three dimensional vector graphics and the player takes control of the titular fighter plane in missions over the Persian Gulf and other locations.

The aircraft moves forward by itself and the player's control is limited to steering, climbing, diving and shooting. When an enemy appears within the player's view the head on computer automatically locates it and locks on target and the player simply has to press the fire button to shoot it down. In additional to the primary machine gun attack there is also a missile attack that is initiated by holding down the fire button. Enemies includes most commonly aircrafts but also ground targets such as installations, tanks and gun emplacements. While playing it's necessary to keep track of the plane's damage and fuel levels. At times collectibles will appear and picking these up will recharge some of the fuel or repair some of the damage.</desc>

		<desc>You have discovered evidence that a rogue group of police officers are involved in a stolen car racket To stop them profiting form their dubious actions you must get across America as quickly as possible. This is made a little easier by the fact that your turbocharged Ferrari F40 can do over 300 MPH.

There are many forks in the road, with arrows at the top of the screen indicating which route is quicker. Any high-speed contact causes the car to blow up, but you have an infinite supply of these, and the only real penalty is the lost time. There are lots of road blocks to swerve around. The police are after you - pay attention to the sirens and stay out of their way.</desc>

		<desc>The Faery Tale Adventure is a role-playing game in which the player can assume control of any of the three brothers - Julian, Philip, or Kevin. Each of the three has his own strengths: Julian is the archetypal melee fighter, Philip has high luck and intelligence, while Kevin is known for his kindness. Should the player fail while controlling one of the brothers, the next one will replace him. Each brother will be revived a few times when vanquished by an enemy, until his luck runs out, at which point he will die permanently.</desc>

		<desc>Fallen Angel is a side scrolling fighting game similar to Double Dragon. You play the fallen angel, sent on a mission to locate the leader of a drug distribution network. Beginning in the London underground, each level will present you with two tasks to complete: find a plane ticket to reach the next level, and destroy the ring leader of the area. To do this you will need to fight the (often well armed) thugs found in the various underground train stations and on the trains themselves. Each level consists of several stations; when all the thugs in a station are defeated, you may get on the train to go to a different station. The plane ticket you are searching for may be found in any one of these stations, and the level boss will be found in the last station. You are free to complete these two tasks in any order you choose, and don't need to visit the stations in any particular order. Fallen angel has the ability to perform a variety of kicks and punches to deal with the bad guys, and can occasionally pick up weapons.</desc>

		<desc>The evil wizard Zaks has cast a spell on the peaceful Yolkfolk, and while many fell under his spell, others have other problems to deal with, including Dizzy, who saw his girlfriend Daisy kidnapped and taken hostage by Zaks, and it's up to him to restore the Yolkfolk to normal and rescue Daisy from the top of the Cloud Castle's tower.

The most technically-advanced of Dizzy's adventure games in many ways, it was the only one to feature actual scrolling rather than a flick-screen system, the only one not to be released for the 8 bit computers the character originated on, the only one to originate on a console, as well as featuring many mini-games, such as Bubble Dizzy and an Operation Wolf clone.

Gameplay involves walking Dizzy through the levels, picking up objects and using them to solve simple puzzles. There are plenty of tests of arcade skill along the way as well, as gaps must be jumped and baddies avoided - starting with a limited number of lives, the player can earn more by completing Theodore's puzzle. Before rescuing Daisy the player must capture all stars that unlock the gates of the tower.</desc>

		<desc>Fantastic Voyage is a side-scrolling shooter based on the 1966 movie of the same name. The scientist Jan Benes is near death because of a clot of blood in his brain. A submarine, controlled by the player, is shrunk and needs to reach the brain through three levels. The enemies, which lower the energy bar when touched, are the human defense systems like antibody cells.

Besides shooting enemies, there are also various passages in which the player needs to guide the submarine through narrow corridors without touching the environment. On the way the player needs to collect nine circuit boards required to destroy the blood cot; those may be hidden in dead ends or alternate ways. This means the player can move back and forth to try other routes at forks. It is important to pick up oxygen and fuel canisters in order to keep the submarine functional. Shield energy can be refilled by killing three enemies without missing a shot.</desc>

		<desc>Fantasy World Dizzy is an arcade adventure video game released in October 1989 by Codemasters and designed by the Oliver twins. The game is considered the third in the Dizzy series and was developed under the name Dizzy III. 

Fantasy World Dizzy was the first Dizzy adventure to feature many elements which later became standard for the series, such as having three lives, an improved inventory system and a balance between puzzle-solving and hazards. This game also introduced the Yolkfolk: Daisy, Denzil, Dozy, Dylan and Grand-Dizzy.</desc>

		<desc>Fast Lane! is a racing game, simulating the C-1 championship. It has nine tracks, including Horama, Le Mans, Suzuka and Donnington. There is a practice mode in which you can get used to the gears, which can also be set to auto transmission. Many options on the car can be tweaked, for example the angle of the front and rear spoilers, the tires and more. A detailed damage model can be shown and also fuel settings can be changed (you can reduce the amount of fuel in the tank).

Before a race, you have to qualify by getting a good time during three rounds on the empty racing track. Depending on the qualifying time you start in the field. The graphics are displayed with zooming sprites, and the track is not flat, but features some hills that limit the view of the further road. Despite the car options, this game is not a real simulation but plays like an arcade racer.</desc>

		<desc>Winwood was just an ordinary man, an owner of a small record shop - certainly not a very suitable profession for someone who would become a hero in a magical land. But fate had its own plans for our hero. One day, feeling particularly drowsy, Winwood closed his shop and fell asleep on the sofa. Soon his dream turned into a nightmare: he realized he was trapped in his own dream world, a fantasy land with mages and ferocious monsters, unable to wake up. An old man named Naristos explained to him that a mysterious mage known as Thardan has been terrorizing the land for a long time. Thardan's power might be the only solution to Winwood's predicament. As a traveler between the worlds, Winwood alone stands the chance of getting close to Thardan, and perhaps ridding the magical land of his tyranny.

Fate: Gates of Dawn is a first-person role-playing game with turn-based combat, similar in visual style and gameplay to Wizardry and Bard's Tale games. The player can recruit up to 28 characters, resulting in four parties that can be controlled separately. A notable feature of the game is a day/night cycle with weather effects that influence the behavior of the world's inhabitants. For example, less creatures will venture outside if it is raining; the player can choose to cast the Rain spell to reduce the number of hostile encounters.

There is a total of 32 different character classes in the game; many of them are traditional (like Wizard or Cleric), but there are also many exotic ones, such as for example Nymph, Banshee, Valkyrie, and others. Each class has abilities and spells associated with it. The world of the game is inhabited by eleven races, each with its own background history.</desc>

		<desc>One night, when Roy Fat was home, thugs from the evil Thindicate corporation kidnap Roy's old lady while she watches television, and the only way that Roy is going to get her back is to trade her for the Duplicator, and the complete documentation that came with it.

There are seven stages to the game, and there are three levels each in the first stage, only two in the rest. The object of the game is to eat all the food that there is in the level. Once all food is eaten by Roy, a tone will sound, meaning that the gate that leads Roy into the next level will be open. Stopping him from doing this is insects and other wildlife, including rats, birds, bats, and many more. Roy is able to fix this, however, by using a variety of weapons like his foot, his fat tummy, carrots, mushroom bombs, and my personal favorite, his burp. He can also jump in the air and land on his ass to get rid of enemies.

If he touches an enemy, he loses one of his lives. If he loses all his lives, the game is over. Once Roy has collected all the food in a stage, he has to face a boss that is usually much bigger than him. Fatman can also pass flags, which lets him continue where he left off if he loses a life. Besides enemies, other hazards need to be looked out for, including spike, spikeballs, water, and fire.</desc>

		<desc>One of the numerous Doom style games for the Amiga in the mid 90s. Like Gloom, it was published by Guildhall Leisure, who gave the Amiga a lot of time in that era.

Fears took the approach of having full-screen, though relatively low-resolution, graphics. The level landscapes feature lots of stairways and lifts, giving it a pseudo-3D feel. The game is played across 30 levels, with a level designer also included. The one-player game has 3 difficulty levels, while multi-player action is available via a null-modem cable.</desc>

		<desc>Fernandez is a despot who has invaded the Republic of El Diablo, bringing terror to the local people. The rightful leaders of the country have called you in to destroy Fernandez's hideouts and bring his country back to the people.

Fundamentally this is a Commando clone, scrolling vertically and with hordes of enemies to be taken on, with finding good shielding spots and launching surprise attacks an especially useful strategy.You have unlimited bullets and limited but collectible grenades to use. There are landmines to avoid, and medical packs to pick up.

On each of the 8 levels you must destroy Fernandez's buildings, which are accessed through an underground network of tunnels. You're not limited to being on foot - you start off in a jeep and can also use motorbikes, tanks and similar, although losing a life destroys this. In 2-player mode you can split driving and gunning duties. When starting a new game, you always start from the point at which you died in the last game.</desc>

		<desc>With the full support of Scuderia Ferrari, Formula One racing was recreated in detail in this simulation, with the top drivers and teams of 1986 to compete against for the most successful F1 team of all. You job does not start at the racetrack; perfecting the car at the Maranello factory, in the wind tunnel to sort aerodynamics, and at the test track of Fiorano, is all required to get the most competitive car you can.

You can jump straight into the races however, either as one-offs or a full championship season. Races can last from 18km to the full 300+km distance, with all the practice and qualifying sessions. Car setup at the track involves selecting wing settings, tyre compounds, fuel usage (important in the days of turbocharged engines) and the like. The action is viewed from inside the cockpit, with rear-view mirrors to help prevent collisions.</desc>

		<desc>Wizards Learic and Leanoric have a long-standing feud, and would do anything to see off their rival. As Learic, this is your task.

Collecting herbs to cast spells is the main basis of the game. There are 24 herbs and flowers to be collected, which are used to make one of 12 spells (the herbs are only used for 1 spell, so there's no need to decide which spell you'd prefer to have access to). You can use a combination of the spells (including a teleporter, invisibility and a fireball, which you must work our how to use). Leanoric's direction relative to yourself is indicated by a compass.</desc>

		<desc>A corrupt businessman by the name of I.M. Tightwad, whom the circus owes $10,000, arrives on the scene with the intent of demolishing the circus unless it can pay up. He plans to build a set of luxury hotels on the terrain. In a fit of desperation, the ringmaster organises a display of six events to raise money for the doomed circus: diving, juggling, trapeze, knife throwing, tightrope and the human cannonball. The performance in each event is judged by five clown judges, who offer money depending on the quality of the show. The businessman has no intention of letting the circus raise the cash though, and he sends his lackey, the evil Fiendish Freddy, to sabotage the acts.
Each player is represented by a circus animal (tiger, lion, bear, etc.)

The game was similar to many of the multi-event sports games of the time such as Epyx' California Games, Winter Games and Summer Games. However, Fiendish Freddy differed not only by its surroundings (circus events) offering a comedy element, it also offered a plot and a clear goal of winning $10,000. The six events were thus:

Diving
The player is challenged to jump off four diving boards of increasing height into containers of water of decreasing size, beginning with a huge wooden container, and ending in a glass of water. (The third target, however, is a cement block, a possible homage to the Looney Tunes cartoon Big Top Bunny, amongst other things.) Money is earned by completing all four levels, as well as performing a set series of stunts. Freddy attempts to hinder the player by blowing the diver off course with an enormous hair dryer; he appears if the diver fails to complete the stunt in time.

Juggling
The player must make their way through four juggling sessions of increasing difficulty. Each level brings more balls to juggle, but not just balls - sometimes babies get lost in the mass and must be thrown back into their prams. Of course, Freddy throws a surprise or two into the mix, in the form of bombs, which can be thrown back at Freddy to consequently explode in his face, or missiles which must be juggled as per other objects. Dropping bombs or missiles will cause them to explode and kill the juggler.
The juggler is allowed five mistakes (marked by dots changing from green to red) before the game is over. Missing five times without dying from a bomb or missile leads an off-stage performer to use a cane to grab the juggler and yank him off screen.

		<desc>Fightin' Spirit is a one-on-one beat 'em up centred around a competition by a gang overlord to find new heavies for his organisation. Ten tough-nuts have come forward, such as Burke the squaddie and Eric the biker. Many of these have special moves in which they can turn into an animal - Tong Lee can become a tiger and Lorente a puma.

Special moves are selected using a combination of joystick/pad movements followed by a tap of fire. The game can be played with or without blood, and in a turbo speed mode, with tournament and tag-team options for potential multi-player tournaments. The game supports CD32 controllers as well as one-button joysticks.</desc>

		<desc>Football coin-op conversion. Large sprites and small playing field. Passing is not important as the main emphasis is on winning the ball and running with it. Very difficult to keep hold of the ball when you are in possession as the opposition defenders have a lot more pace than the player with the ball so games tend to be a melee in the middle of the field of players all frantically tackling each other for possession.</desc>

		<desc>Final Assault is a mountain climbing action/simulation game. The object of the game is to climb to the peak of a mountain via several different trails of varying difficulty. Progress is made in a fashion similar to that used in Epyx 'games' series, with alternating joystick movements. To help out, you carry a backpack which you may stock with assorted items. Since there is a weight limit, you must choose which items you most likely will need for a given trail. For example, an exceptionally long trail may require camping gear and some additional food, where as a short trail will allow for some more luxuries such as extra rope.</desc>

		<desc>The Norse Kingdom is threatened by the Iniquitous Hel, goddess of Niflheim and purveyor of evil. Thor, the great god of law and order, has been selected by his fellow gods to travel through four Norse worlds in an attempt to stop Hel spreading evil and ruling his people. The journey will be long and ardulous. Hel has sent creatures to meet Thor, delay his progress, and kill him. A variety of pitfalls and traps await him.

To travel between worlds, Thor must collect the four segments of a key that will unlock the exit door. One segment lies inside a building, the rest are outdoors. If he fails to find all segments of the key when he gets to the exit door, then he goes back to the start of the world to search for what segments that he has missed.

Hel's creatures will try to stop him from doing this, but he can deal with them using a variety of weapons, such as fireballs and axes, and he can carry two weapons simultaneously, and can switch between them at any time. Potions can be obtained by destroying the flying creatures that go back and forth each screen. At the end of each world, Thor must defeat a much bigger creature in order to get to the exit door.</desc>

Only the first four of the game's twelve missions are selectable. The objective, terrain and enemies change depending on the mission, with a full intelligence briefing for each available. The ide of the mission don't change much, you've basically got to kill everything or destroy a specific target, but the actual objectives do. one minute you'll be taking out an enemy bridge, the next seeking and destroying a cache of SAM missiles or assassinating an enemy dictator.</desc>

		<desc>In Fire! the player mans an advanced helicopter and tries to solve some of humanity's problems by shooting at them. The game consists of five thematically unrelated levels which consist of two stages each, e.g. in one mission the player has to destroy drug plants in South America and another one requires to deal with terrorists at sea.

Regarding gameplay, this is a traditional, horizontally scrolling shooter: the player moves from left to right while shooting everything which moves. Shields and fuel are limited and if one reaches zero, the one and only life is lost. However, they can be refilled with power ups which are left behind from killed enemies. The standard gun can be either aimed straight or slightly downwards, but by picking up the correct power ups the weapon system can be upgraded.</desc>

		<desc>In First Contact, a communication space station is overrun by aliens. The player takes control over the maintenance droid with the goal to keep the station running as long as possible. The aliens will destroy vital part of the station and the droids need to repair them. There are also other important tasks like getting repairing equipment out of lockers or refueling. 

The player does not control the droid directly, but programs a script which is then performed independently. If the droid is interrupted, they stop the program and don't fight back. It has to be manually restarted by the player. To be more effective, the droid can be split into three droids with different abilities which have to be programmed individually. The game ends when all droids are disabled by the aliens, but if only one or two are down they can be repaired. There are four decks which can be reached through teleports.</desc>

		<desc>"The Demon King descends from his mountain domain to you, the First Samurai and your master. Defenceless against the Demon's magic, you succumb to his powers, leaving the your Master to fight the Demon King alone. Your master falls in combat, dying. But, with his last breath, he summons the Wizard Mage. The Demon King fearing defeat, escapes to the future. Tormented, the young samurai seeks the teachings of the Wizard Mage in the ways of magic. Boiled with revenge and armed with a magical sword, the young samurai follows the Demon King into the future and the unknown..."

The First Samurai is a platform action game very much similar to other platform games, but with a medieval oriental touch to it in addition to various unique features.

Arriving in the new unknown land, you are defenceless hence your fists and kicks. But as you journey forth, you'll find your trusty magical sword as well as throwing weapons such as knives and axes. With your martial art skills, your enemy best beware with those sudden moves that may prove fatal!

The First Samurai offers a wide array of weapons, special items and other objects. Combat is usually melee, either relying on your punch or kicks or using the magical sword to slash some pretty skillful blows in whatever direction possible.

Monsters are forever regenerating but food for health is plentiful. It actually takes an effort to be killed...</desc>

		<desc>Inter-Dimensional Espionage. Inter-Dimensional... because you can "warp" into the body of a living thing in this or any other dimension. Espionage... because there are good guys and bad. And you're a good one... with years under your belt and a multitude of successful missions behind your dark glasses. The payoff? You get a vacation, and the ultimate vacation in this business is to become a goldfish.

Yes, a goldfish. Hey, it's cushy. You swim a little, eat a little, live in a castle. (So what if it's plastic.) Just as you were getting into the vacation mode (umbrella drink and all), the tide turns. The most dangerous group of inter-dimensional anarchists surface - the Seven Deadly Fins. This septic septet will stop at nothing to destroy all forms of life as we know it. And wouldn't you know it, you are drafted to stop them!</desc>

		<desc>Five fighters have come together to fight in three different locations, Egypt, Japan and America. Only one can be Fist Fighter champion.

Fist Fighter is a one to two-player fighting game on a single screen which does scroll left and right a short distance. Various options are available like location of fight, difficulty and number of players. You also have the choice of five fighters. The joystick is used to deploy various moves to hurt your opponent and two bars are seen at the top of the screen, which gets smaller when you or your opponent are hit. There is also a timer which counts down from 99 seconds.</desc>

		<desc>Football Glory gets a makeover in this recreation of five-a-side football. The basic game engine is much the same, with identical menu systems and similar styling to the team selection (albeit with less players). Gameplay is similar to Sensible Soccer, with loose ball control (although there are 3 options for this), small playing sprites and an emphasis on ground passing, plus a few speech bubble comments when the ball goes dead.

Two distinct sets of 5-a-side rules are featured, English and International, with full explanations of the differences built into the game. There are seven different pitch surfaces, ranging form grass and Astroturf to concrete and plastic, as well as the option of playing without a fence keeping the ball constantly in play. Tournaments and friendlies can be played, using either club or international teams.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2142. The player takes control of Conrad B. Hart, a man who has lost his memory. After barely escaping from hostile aliens, Conrad's bike crashes on an unknown planet. Conrad finds himself in the jungle, and from that moment on his quest for survival and his lost identity begins.

Flashback: The Quest for Identity incorporates elements of platforming, shooting, and problem-solving. The game can be described as a "cinematic platformer" (commonly referred to as Prince of Persia-style), following a design philosophy that was also manifested in Delphine Software's previous work, Another World. Compared to that game, Flashback focuses more on platforming and exploration of large levels.

While a large bulk of the gameplay is dedicated to running, jumping, and shooting enemies, there is also a considerable exploration element in the game, as well as some puzzle-solving. The player navigates Conrad through platform structures, performing various moves. It is possible to simply jump or do a longer run-and-jump, run, climb, hang off ledges, and pick up objects lying on the ground.

To defend himself, Conrad can shoot enemies with his gun and also use various objects (such as stones) to harm or distract them. Crouching and rolling are possible (and often essential) moves that can be executed during combat. The gun has unlimited ammunition; however, shields that Conrad uses to protect himself from attacks are depleted when he is hit, and can be recharged at special stations. Though most environments in the game are hostile, there are a few locations that are devoid of enemies. The player is usually required to talk to characters, gather information and compete tasks in an adventure-like fashion in these areas.</desc>

		<desc>In 1949, Joe King, pilot for hire and owner of the Amazon Queen airplane which he uses for his work, arrives at a hotel in Rio de Janeiro to transport his next customer, famous film actress Faye Russel, only to be ambushed by his Dutch rival Anderson. Locked in a hotel room and trapped by Anderson's goons, Joe quickly gains assistance from Lola, a showgirl at the hotel and a former love interest, and escapes, making it back to the airport with his mechanic Sparky, just in time to stop his rival taking Faye. Wasting no time, Joe quickly pilots the Amazon Queen towards the location of Faye's shoot, only for a storm to cause him to crash-land in the Amazon jungle. After getting Faye and Sparky to safety, Joe begins searching for help, soon encountering a parrot named Wedgewood with a message for help. Seeking out the person the message was for, Joe meets with Trader Bob, who soon asks for his help in rescuing a princess named Azura from Floda, a lederhosen company that Bob suspects is a cover for something sinister

Joe quickly begins searching for the jungle, encountering an entire tribe of Amazon women who capture him and took in Faye when she decided to seek help herself. Released by the tribe, Joe agrees to help them rescue Azura as well. Finding the princess within a hidden base beneath Floda, Joe frees her and returns to her tribe, only to find himself coming face-to-face with Floda's leader - Dr. Frank Ironstein, a mad scientist who seeks to conquer the world by turning Amazon women into dinosaur warriors through the use of his DinoRay invention. Seeing that Joe was smart to get around his security, Ironstein coerces him into helping him find an artifact from a temple that he requires known as the Crystal Skull, threatening to harm Azura if he doesn't. Left with no choice, Joe agrees, and heads for the temple, navigating traps and puzzles and eventually finding what he needs. Returning it to Ironstein, Joe quickly finds himself betrayed and trapped in Floda's base, but soon escapes and goes after Ironstein with the help of Anderson, his rival having originally been hired by the scientist to assist but later deciding to turn against him. Heading into the valley, Joe assists in trying to find Ironstein and manages to stop him, saving the day, before taking the scientist's Zeppelin and flying into the sunset. </desc>

		<desc>Flight Path 737 is a flight simulator or as the cover says an "advanced pilot trainer". The player is the pilot of a jet airliner and his task is to take of from an airport, climb over the mountains that surrounds it and then land safely on an airfield in the valleys below. The player only gets one chance as there is only enough fuel for one landing. The game is played from a first person perspective and the screen is split into two parts: a landscape view at the top and the instrument panel below. The instrument panel shows all the information that is needed such as altitude, speed and artificial horizon. The game can be played on six different skill levels. Each level adds more complexity to the task.</desc>

The gameplay is platform based, although the player may move down platforms as well as up to the next one. There are lots of baddies (drawn in a cutesy style) who need shooting and offer rewards. The seven levels are fairly short and linear.</desc>

		<desc>Flink is a jump-'n-run game set in the fantasy world of Imagica. The evil wizard Wicked Wainwright has captured the four elders and it is up to Flink, a wizard's apprentice, to set them free and defeat Wicked Wainwright.

Apart from the usual platformer elements, the game has a unique feature: Flink's ability to create spells. Whenever the game is paused, Flink can combine three ingredients to create a spell. Ingredients can be collected throughout the game. They are usually carried around by a certain type of enemy or hidden in treasure chests. There are ten different spells, the "recipes" which are contained in scrolls that are given to Flink by rescued elders or found within certain levels. The spells include different attack spells (for example a demon that accompanies Flink and attacks his enemies), a shield spell, a shrink spell, a quick grow spell that lets certain plants grow so that Flink can reach new areas of a level, magic keys that open locked treasure chests and more. Casting spells uses up magic energy that can be replenished by collecting magic bottles or defeating enemies. Similar to the Sonic games, when Flink is hit, he looses all of his magic energy and has only limited time to pick it up again. If he is hit while having no magic energy, he loses a life.</desc>

		<desc>Flip-it &amp; Magnose, the title characters of this action game with strong puzzle elements, live on Mars. Unfortunately the planet has not exactly the biggest water resources of the universe and so they are sent to Earth to get some. In the vertically scrolling platform levels the player has to solve puzzles by collecting objects and using them at the right place respectively giving them to the right people. However, the water is not given directly, but there is a water drop which has to be caught by using the water catcher object. The goal of each level is to collect a certain amount of water within the time limit.

The player character can't die, but loses fruit when he falls too much of a distance. Fruit can be collected when wandering through the levels and are used between the six levels to buy traps which have different effects (and of course different prices), e.g. wasting a bit of time or reversing the controls. This is useful because the two Martians don't work together and try to beat each other's water score. There are also other items to collect which are not directly related to puzzle solving, like a spring for long jumps and objects which help against special hazards in the level. Collecting pills is a bit of a gamble because they can either add or subtract points on the water or fruit counter. The game uses a split-screen; one half for each Martian. In two-player games, the second Martian is controlled by player two.</desc>

		<desc>Your homeland's precious limited energy is being taken advantage of by the evil Thargoid Empire, and you and your spaceship must do something about it. There are 8 bases to enter, with the aim of using energy pods to cause the reactors to overload and thus malfunction.

The game is viewed side-on, resembling the ST classic Oids quite strongly; which is to say that gravity and motion physics dictate the ship's motion strongly. The 8 levels all have plenty of enemies on offer, both wall-mountings and actual ships, as well as enhanced weapons and extra fuel and shield energy. The ship can take some damage, and repairs itself over time (for no logical reason), which is one of the few things that gives you a hope of getting anywhere early on. Losing a life causes all the enemy turrets to replenish, emphasizing the restart points and making things more maze-based and methodical.</desc>

		<desc>Football Glory (Fu&#xDF;ball Total! in German-speaking countries) is a 1994 football video game developed by Croteam and published by Black Legend that became famous due to the many similarities with Sensible Software's Sensible Soccer. It was released for both IBM compatibles and Commodore Amiga, and later peaked as high as second in the Amiga sales chart.

In essence a clone of Sensible Soccer, Football Glory was a more laid back, and at points, a much more comical approach: apart from several new features such as overhead and heel kicks, it included several seemingly unrelated animations (including female streakers and hooligans with assorted police officers chasing them, toilet paper and firecrackers thrown to the field by the audience after a goal, and cartoon-like talking bubbles after a referee decision, after which the player was allowed to chase the referee), and various other little amusing touches, such as the snow-ridden field having a snowman as a corner flag and icicles hanging down from the crossbar.

In 1998, Croteam released Football Glory as freeware. </desc>

		<desc>Football Manager from Addictive was the first game of its kind, and this sequel followed several years later, absorbing ideas from the many similar games released in between. Teams can now choose formations, and assign man-to-man marking. Players have individual skills and fitness ratings, in a more realistic way, with half-time substitutions and tactical changes supported. The whole 92-club league is incorporated, as is the League Cup alongside the FA Cup. It is now possible to watch and assess the individual performance of the players, with match graphics differentiating the attack / midfield / defense areas more clearly. Training allows passing length and height to be specified.</desc>

		<desc>Forgotten Worlds features two characters known as The Nameless Ones, who both look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, one even has a mohawk. It's their job to rid the planet of the attacking aliens.

Guiding your character around the screen as they fly with jet-packs, guns on full auto, you control a satellite which you rotate around your character for the direction in which your gun is firing. At the end of each level is a boss which needs to be killed to progress.

Enemies that have been killed drop money. At the end of every level is a shop where you can buy weapons, armour, items and first-aid packs.</desc>

		<desc>A simple arcade game, where you have to test your skills with F1 cars. The sound effect consist of the now standard engine drone and the 'kaboom' as two cars collide and, on the whole, they are sufficient. Some of the graphics are well presented, the scrolling background is used well and changes with every track. The track itself, however, is patterned with dark and light shades of gray and can be very off-putting. Overall, Formula 1 Grand Prix is something and nothing. It is by no means an outstanding game but it may be worth a viewing.</desc>

		<desc>he player is taken the role of Zak, a prisoner in a planetary prison called Waste, and of course, you have to escape. Stealing a space craft, you fight your way through the guarding forces.

Foundations Waste is a vertically scrolling shoot-'em-up, in which you have to collect extra weapons, like a side shot, shields, a drone which can be controlled by the inverse control of the player ship and some kind of seeking missiles. Sometimes the power ups are fakes, inverting your control or slowing your ship down. You loose all extra weapons either on dying or on entering a new level.

The enemy forces are tanks, ships, flying vessels and later even space ships. Each level is featuring an end-of-level guard, which can be destroyed for extra points, but can even passed if your fire-power is too low at that moment.</desc>

		<desc>From the people who brought you that excellent version of Donkey Kong a couple of months back comes Frantic Freddie, yet another platform game. If anything (and some may find this hard to believe) it's even simpler than Kong. Hero Freddie has to be manoeuvred around the network of platforms and ladders whilst picking up the goodies and avoiding the roving nasties. Not so bad, eh? Ah, but the twist here is that Freddie can't walk through the ladders, so if he's not careful it's very easy for him to get trapped in a dead-end. However, that aside, that's pretty much all there is to say.

It's simple, enjoyable and very fast paced. However, it can get a bit frustrating simply due to the ease with which you can get caught by the ghoulies. (Ahem!) All-in-all, Frantic Freddie's unlikely to keep you glued to your monitor all night long, but it's the sort of game you're likely to load up from time to time just for a quick go.</desc>

		<desc>Freak Out is a fast-paced strategy game where each level takes the player to a different location, to contain the attack of the fuzzy intruders. The playing field consists of interconnected cells, arranged in concentric squares. The Freaks (which come in four different colors) pop out of a hatch at the center, and can be moved about by rotating and smacking them, which sends them jumping to the next cell (if it isn't occupied). To score points and eliminate Freaks, three of the same color must be placed in adjacent cells, making them vanish in a puff of smoke.

Speed is essential, since the quickly-reproducing aliens line up behind the hatch: if you let the queue get too long, it's game over. Random items and obstacles pop up occasionally, like bonus gems, freezing ice, stone walls, or colored circles (which can only be occupied by a Freak of the same hue). As the game advances, new challenges and mini-puzzles appear, which force the player to respond before more Freaks can be eliminated. A password records the player's progress after every level.</desc>

		<desc>In Frost Byte you control Hickey the Kreezer, an elastic curve which moves sideways, jumps and shoots. You must navigate your way through planet Cosmica, and rescue your brethren, within the limited 'Twang' energy you have.

Cosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected throughout your quest.

Three sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional objects to pick up and use as well.</desc>

		<desc>Full Metal Plan&#xE8;te is a tie-in of a board game of the same name. Up to four players land on a planet with their motherships, trying to gather as much ore as possible within 24 game rounds.

This almost sounds like a happy, idyllic round of pick-the-flowers, if it weren't for the truckload of tanks and destroyers that each players happens to have in the cargo area of his mothership. So the players usually spend an equal amount of time picking up ore and bashing their contenders' heads in.

The computer game is an accurate conversion of the board game; virtually every feature is present. Strategy is needed to succeed in the game. The only semi-random thing are the tides (high tide, low tide, and something in-between) which can strand boats and engulf tanks, but even they can be partially predicted.</desc>

		<desc>In Fury of the Furries, you control a cute, round creature called Tiny, who must defeat "the wicked one" who has captured the King, and turned all the Tinies into mindless monsters. Fortunately your Tiny has special powers. It can transform himself into a swimmer, rock eater, fireball spitter, or rope swinger during its quest.

The game takes place on a huge island separated into eight regions: Desert, Lagoon, Forest, Pyramids, Mountains, Factory, Village, and finally the Castle.

For the US release, the title was changed to 'Pac-In-Time'. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek, Super Skweek, Tiny Skweeks/Brainies/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.</desc>

		<desc>Fusion is an action game in which your job is to find nine pieces of a fusion bomb scattered over 13 levels. There are two craft at your disposal: a fighter and a detachable ground vehicle. To find the bomb pieces, many enemies and their spawning points must be destroyed. Barriers block the access to other levels and keys must be found to open them. Certain areas can only be reached by the ground craft which is not as powerful as the fighter, however - some careful planning is required.</desc>

		<desc>One of the first Speedball clones takes the basic court layout of basketball as its inspiration. There are 5 players on each team, on a small court with 2 and 3 point shooting areas. The difference is that physical contact of a fairly violent nature is allowed, and the court is littered with mines and bombs to wound the players. Shooting involves holding down fire to get the height right, so avoid being tackled as you prepare your shot. Other basketball rules such as double-dribbling and the 25-second hand-over are unsurprisingly waived. A 3-division league is included to progress through.</desc>

		<desc>Future Bike Simulator is a futuristic action game set in 1999. The government forbid motorcycles and so the billionaire Finnius M Houlder built a hovercraft replacement. And while he was at it, he also added some guns. So now his goal is to drive and kill people who move slower than him (which is everyone). Killed enemies leave behind money which can be reinvested into vehicle upgrades between levels. A life is lost when the energy bar is completely drained, so it is advised to dodge obstacles and vehicles. Movement is restricted to left and right; the speed can't be regulated.</desc>

You have to fight your way through enemy lines in order to find the level's exit similar to popular Gauntlet style mazes. The game has 32 levels and was one of the first games using 32 colours (5 bitmaps) simultaneously outmatching all the Atari ST games that were limited to 16 colours. Furthermore the games used the Hi-Res graphics mode of the Amiga for the first loading screen. This had not been used in a commercial game on Amiga before.</desc>

Progressing from one star system to another you'll discover new planets (friendly or hostile), engaging in space combat or conversation with other characters to further the plot. You are free to travel to wherever you please, but here the plot is much more linear, and you can't do much without running into the next event that triggers a plot advance.</desc>

		<desc>Einstein, Newton and Darwin are the Galactic Warrior Rats, mutant hybrids who come under your control in this top-down multi-directional shooter. Their plan is to save the badly polluted planet Smeaton Five by destroying its robotic defences and the computer primed to explode it. 

Many enemies must be shot down along the way, but most release credits when shot &#x2013; wait a few seconds for these to appear. You have three lives, with each rat representing a life, which means that all upgrades are lost when you lose a life, and each rat&#x2019;s protective biosphere has the ability to withstand a few shots. Before heading into the action, you can spend your initial 500 credits on upgrades and weaponry. Your movement features a degree of inertia, making it harder to stop short of a position.</desc>

		<desc>Galaxy 89 is a Galaga clone. The player controls a spaceship that can only move left and right at the bottom of the screen. The aim of the game is to destroy as many enemy waves as possible without losing all of the extra lives.

Pressing the fire button fires a shot at the enemy attack waves, which enter the screen from different edges. The only other movement possible for the player is a diagonal shot, by moving the controller in the opposite direction they want to fire. The game gets gradually harder with waves appearing behind the player or large amounts of enemy shots the player has to avoid.

Having its roots in an arcade game, the objective of Galaxy 89 is to gain the highest possible score. Destroying waves of enemies gives the player points, as well as the bonus rounds considering mostly of cannon fodder-type enemies that occur after clearing a certain number of waves.</desc>

You will have to fly freely before cutting through tunnels and canyons, and finally destroying an alien base. Your energy read out starts at 1200 and decreases as shots hit you, or you make contact with a wall or blockage. You have infinite cannons and guided missiles to help you along. You can get regular energy recharges and power upgrades, by shooting and then collecting their carrier pods.</desc>

		<desc>This strategic action puzzle game features original gameplay. You control a spacecraft situated on a globe which you can rotate and move around the screen. You must knock globes into others of the same colour, to rid the screen of all the globes. The screen has no borders, so globes can be pushed off the side of the screen, increasing your tactical range. Knocking globes of different colors into each other produces smaller pods which need to be picked up quickly, giving you energy, or they will turn into globes and you will have to get rid of them too. Many of the globes are linked to other globes (or the ship) via string, and the level layouts include barriers as obstacles (and ricochet points), making the Newtonian physics more complex.</desc>

		<desc>You start as a member of the 1988 U.S. Olympic Team to compete at the Olympic Summer Games.

You can play eight events, including Velodrome Sprint Cycling, Hurdles, Pole Vault, Hammer-throw, Uneven Parallel Bars, Rings, Archery, and Springboard Diving. You can practice each event separately or play the whole competition.

The game also features a multiple player option, this makes it a nice party game. If you are alone, you can compete against the computer.

If you're stuck in an event, or want to get better, just take the coaching book (= the manual) and read how you can make more tricks. It also features many real facts of the history of the Olympic summer games.</desc>

		<desc>In Ganymed you fly your ship in a Defender style fashion from the right to the left and back again, trying to destroy the big walkers as they lumber from left to the right. The game is fast, to be sure, but with no real control over what's happening to your ship, if you take off too slowly you get shot; fly faster and you get out of control and crash into one of the Deathbots. The sounds are depressingly similar to the sound effects from the Star Wars games, although nicely synthesised rather than sampled.</desc>

		<desc>In the earliest licensed entertainment videogame of Jim Davis' lazy cat cartoon character, you play Garfield in his attempt to rescue Arlene from the cat pound. The primary gameplay involves object manipulation, gaining objects either by picking up or receiving them from other characters (usually in exchange for other objects). 

Most characters from the cartoons play a part in the game. Odie the dog follows you around - swipe him for points. Garfield's cousin Nermal can help you out. They can also carry objects for Garfield's use.

Garfield needs regular food and rest - without one of these he falls asleep and it is Game Over. Contact with many foes is draining. A butcher's is one major food source.</desc>

		<desc>Gary Lineker's Hot-Shot! is a soccer game in which two teams try to win the match. The adjustable options are the number of players, the time of a half time and the AI level. The game is played in a top-down view and only shows a part of the playfield.

The player either controls the athlete in ball possession or, when in defense, the one which is nearest. When shooting, the power of the shot depends on how long the button was pressed and the direction changes with the joystick movement, e.g. moving against the walking direction results in a overhead kick.</desc>

		<desc>Gauntlet III is an action-based dungeon exploration game. Like in the predecessors you empty areas infested by all kinds of enemies while running for the exit. Like this was rather a straight forward thing in the first two games, it's not that easy to finish a level anymore. While you only had to run until you find the exit (and besides killing hordes of enemies you probably find some keys to unlock doors leading to deeper dungeons) you might have to solve a few "quests" to proceed to the next level in this installment. These "quests" are very basic, for example you have to find object A, then bring it to B, advance to C and finally go to D to uncover the exit.

While the first two games had a top-down view, Gauntlet 3 has an isometric perspective. The old four characters (warrior, wizard, elf and valkyrie) are ready for action again and this time they get backup by four new characters which include the Lizard, Neptune, Stoneman and the Iceman.</desc>

		<desc>This top-down puzzle game starts with a screen featuring a number of red cogs at different parts of the screen, and a grid of pegs (which become less complete on later levels). Your task on each level is to use a number of gears of one of 3 different sizes to ensure that all the pegs are linked together. All this has to be completed before the engine overheats.

Making life harder are two creatures with the peculiar name Poffins'. One of these goes around removing pegs, and the other causes the engine to overheat further. They can be shot out of the way, or have gears placed over them to stop them.

There's also a bonus round, which is a fruit machine, only with cogs and other things from the game rather than fruit.</desc>

Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.</desc>

		<desc>Take the Apache, the new Longbow Apache, The Blackhawk, Comanche Scout, Comanche Gunship, or the MD-500 Defender on campaigns or missions. Updated graphics engine has much more detailed terrain variation with true valleys/hills and even train tunnels that you can fly through. When you are promoted to a sufficient rank you can take along multiple helicopters to accomplish your objectives. The dynamic campaign generates new missions based on multiple maps. Attack, defend, sweep, scout, rescue, drop... Lots of missions to keep you busy. Crew learn and grow in experience as they survive and succeed. A full mission recorder allows you to view EVERY member of your team as they fight or die. Plenty of weapons are available for your side from the latest Hellfire missiles and Sidearm anti-radar missiles to the old fashioned chain gun and gun pods are available for your use. The enemy can be well armed as well, from deadly 2S6 gun/missile combo to old-fashion ZSU-23, even the occasional MiGs.</desc>

		<desc>Gettysburg is a wargame simulating the Battle of Gettysburg (fought on July 1-3, 1863), the turning point and one of the bloodiest battles of the American Civil War. You may choose to command either Union or Confederate forces, it is also possible to play a two player game or watch the computer playing both sides.

As in the previous games in this series, the player is observing the battle area through a 3D perspective, while issuing commands by typing in certain pre-defined text elements (combined with names of commanders, places and time of execution). You will get reports from your officers indicating whether or not your orders have been carried out to the letter.</desc>

		<desc>Ghosts 'N Goblins is a sideways scrolling action platformer spread over six levels, each of which must be completed within three minutes (or a life is lost), taking in forest, village, mountain and cavern settings with increasing difficulty.

Arthur the brave knight must rescue his beloved Princess from the Demon King Astaroth and his forces - amongst them are the various undead (ghosts, zombies), bats, ogres and goblins. Other challenges include moving platforms, ladders and water/fire hazards. 

The player can walk left and right, jump, and is also equipped with a lance to use as a weapon. Getting hit by enemies causes Arthur to lose his armor and run around in his underpants, getting hit again will cause the player to lose a life. As in most games in this genre, the player can pick up power-ups such as daggers and bombs during the course of the game, giving the player greater firepower.</desc>

		<desc>Three years have passed since Arthur defeated the Demon King Astaroth and rescued his beloved Princess Prin-Prin (see Ghosts 'N Goblins). A new villain, the Great Demon King Lucifer (Loki in some versions) has become the new leader of Ghoul Realm. While returning from a journey, Arthur sees the Princess' castle and her village under attack by Lucifer's forces. While rushing towards her beloved knight, the Princess is struck by one of Lucifer's laser beams.

Now, Arthur must venture back to the Lucifer's palace and destroy the demon in order to rescue the Princess' soul and bring her back to life! And it won't matter whether he fights in his shining armor or in his underwear alone...the bravest Knight in the land isn't going to be stopped by some monsters! Although the game starts with graveyard and marsh territory familiar from the first game, later levels are set in a tower, a mass of skeletons, and a castle.

Players progress from left to right (from bottom to top in level 3), and have to hack down the aforementioned monsters with a sword. The journey includes ledges, ladders, lava pits and slippery slopes. Different weapons can be collected, by finding suits of armor inside chests. Each of the five stages has its own setting and a final boss.</desc>

		<desc>While watching television, Giddy learns that an alien spaceship has descended over Cutesville. It starts to send strange waves that modify the behaviour of objects. Suddenly the TV transforms into a jar of pickles. Giddy decides to fight the menace, and return his homeland to normality. But first, he is going to eat the pickles.

Giddy 2 is an Amiga freeware clone of Dizzy and its sequels. Intended as parody of that classic series, it also stars an anthropomorphic egg that must collect objects in order to solve puzzles. On the top screen there are three heart-shaped energy bars for the three lives of the character. If the egg touches any of the enemies, this energy bar decreases, and when it is completely drained the egg explodes with an onomatopoeic "SPLAT!", and the player loses a life. On the top-right side there is the accumulated number of coins collected by the character. Below both items is a black strip that displays the inventory content when in use mode (pressing the space bar enters the use mode, where the player moves the joystick left or right to cycle through the assembled inventory, and hits fire to use the selected object).</desc>

		<desc>Gobliiins is an adventure game where the player controls a team of three goblins: Oups, Ignatius and Asgard (Hooter, Dwayne, and BoBo in the US release) to find four magic components. A voodoo doll has turned their king Angoulafre mad and by collecting the components they can track down Niak the Wizard, the only one who can put things right. The player needs to solve various puzzles by combining the different skills of the three goblins. It's possible switch between them and control them separately. Most of the puzzles are based on coordinated actions. One can cast powerful but erratic spells, another can collect and use objects, and the last can hit things. Action icons are activated at the bottom of the screen. The game takes in 22 landscapes, each of which has puzzles which must be cleared. The characters have limited energy, which can be sapped by traps.

Someone has kidnapped the prince and it's up to you and two hilarious sidekicks, Winkle and Fingus, to rescue him. Winkle is a reckless jokester, while Fingus is careful and has a gift for solving puzzles. Luckily, they're blessed with extraordinary vitality. In other words, they never die. That'll sure come in handy when you're up against Wily Wizard's traps, maniacal monsters, and twisted and perplexing puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>It is said that there is a mysterious labyrinth harboring great secrets that might fulfill the wishes of those who discover them. Two countries respectively ruled by Queen Xina and King Bodd have been competing over the right to explore the labyrinth. However, strange events started happening one after the other: the guardian of the labyrinth died, his daughter disappeared, and King Bodd apparently fell under some sort of a curse. A goblin reporter named Blount get caught in the midst of these events as he attempts to interview the queen and the king. As if that weren't enough, Blount also gets bitten by a werewolf and falls in love, and must find a way to deal with both predicaments.

Goblins Quest is the third entry in the Gobliiins series. Like its predecessors, it is a puzzle adventure game with the emphasis on solving complex tasks confined to smaller areas rather than on exploration</desc>

		<desc>In Gold Rush!, Jerrod Wilson (the player) receives a letter from his long-lost brother (who fled the city years before when was hastily accused and convicted of a crime he didn't commit) asking him to join in Sacramento, California. If that's not enough for Jerrod sell everything and give his hometown Brooklyn a fond adieu, under the stamp was one of the first nuggets of Californian gold seen in the Atlantic shores of the United States. So, Jerrod bids farewell to his peaceful life as a newspaper editor, and becomes a fore-runner in the the great Gold Rush of 1849, hoping to find his brother and "strike gold" (literally).

Released late into the lifespan of Sierra's AGI engine, Gold Rush! features some tricks not seen before the more advanced SCI engine, such as enlarged characters, but it is best known for the three routes available to reach California: by land, travel by boat to reach the Atlantic shore of Panama, cross the isthmus, and then get a second boat in the Pacific shore, or making the dangerous all-boat trip by Cape Horn. Each route has it's dangers: Cholera might strike as you make your way across the Northern states or your boat might sink.. As usual with Sierra adventures, instant killing happens if the player is careless, but will also happen at random. Other important (and innovative) concept is the game being timed. If Jerrod takes too long to leave Brooklyn, passages to California increase in price, and his house devalues.</desc>

		<desc>The Golden Path is a point and click adventure game. Instead of using verbs like in Maniac Mansion, the player controls the monk with the mouse by moving a cursor shaped like a Chinese letter and clicking directly at him on the screen. Left-clicking on a spot on the ground moves the monk towards it. Left-clicking below Y'n Hsi makes him bend over to drop or pick objects on the ground. Left-clicking above his head makes him try to use the object he is holding at the moment (if it is not possible to do so, a question mark appears). Right-clicking makes him punch and kick, his defense against enemies. Every time the monk is hit, the inventory briefly flashes. A book sits at the bottom-left of the screen, and serves as a hint system of sorts. When clicking on it, a message about the screen appears with explanations to events, characters and objects. Besides the book is the inventory with four slots for objects. Left-clicking on an object places it on Y'n Hsi hands. Above the inventory is a slowly withering vine as the energy bar. It grows with the completion of certain tasks. 

The main objective is to follow the golden path. Literally. On the bottom-right of the screen there is a small version of the main game screen that shows the path and its bifurcations. The character moves from screen to screen collecting things laying around, fighting the occasional enemy and using the right object at the right place.</desc>

		<desc>Goldrunner II is set 50 years after the events of its predecessor. Since then humanity has started to use robot pilots for defense, but space pirates have managed to capture them. The hero, the grandchild of the original Goldrunner, now has to save or at least destroy the robots before they can be used against their creators.

To do so he flies through 16 vertically scrolling levels, called platforms, to shoot down the transporters carrying the robots. Then he collects the robots (the capacity is up to five at a time) flies to the teleporter station, unloads and repeats until all robots in the level are captured or destroyed. Well, it is not that easy: every destroyed transporter causes recovery ships - basically enemy fighters and mines - to show up, which need to be destroyed first. The game also features dust clouds which block the ship's shots and smart bombs which destroy all enemies on the screen when used.</desc>

When the train smoke stack produces colored shapes, such as a square, circle, or triangle, the child must press the spacebar key. If the shape and color matches the shape and color above a Disney character waiting on the train platform, then the train will stop and pick up that passenger. Otherwise an unique animation appears somewhere on the screen for entertainment.</desc>

		<desc>Graeme Souness Soccer Manager is a basic football managing game based on the English leagues where the player is responsible for bringing a team (any available) from the Conference to the top division.

Options are limited: the player can select the starting eleven, the players being rated in both ability and fitness, explore the transfer market for signing better players and request overdraft extensions. While no player refuses the sign for your team (even if it's still on the Conference), the real game challenge is to balance finances, and avoid paying too much in wages while still in the lower divisions.</desc>

		<desc>The most important feature of Graeme Souness: Vector Soccer are the three-dimensional vector graphics. To accompany this, the camera perspectives are relatively near to the playfield; a small overlay of the whole field which is shown in the right corner is required to get an overview.

The rest of the game offers no surprises: the player takes the role of a soccer team, either during a friendly match or a tournament, and tries to win. The athletes are directly controlled and are able to perform actions like shooting or passing. There are various match settings available, e.g. difficulty level or match length. In multiplayer mode, either two players play against each other or up to eight players are responsible for one team each during a tournament.</desc>

		<desc>One of the few computer games recreating cricket, the traditional summer pastime in many English-speaking countries. The game had different licenses with well-known cricketers in different countries. It was Audiogenic's second cricket game, 8 years after Graham Gooch's Test Match.

All the international sides are present, with the chance to change the player data and choose the team yourself. Test match and limited-overs matches are available, with 1 or 2 innings per team, and you can turn the Leg-before-wicket dismissal off, which makes the game easier to understand.

There are 3 skill levels - Amateur, Professional and World Class. The bowling involves positioning a cursor to place the bowl, then controlling the speed/spin (depending on the type of bowler selected). Batting involves timing one of the many available shots, and fielding is largely automated.</desc>

		<desc>Although Graham Taylor was the England international football manager at the time this game was released, the player starts a management career managing in Division 3 of the league, and have to work your way up, either by improving your squad (much as Taylor did in his successful spell with Watford, who he took from the 4th tier of English football to the top division and the FA Cup Final) or by doing well enough to earn a job elsewhere. Once you can finish in the top 5 of the league, you get a password to load the international management game, in a manner similar to many of Dinamic's games.

The standard features of football management games are included, such as player transfers, team selection and organising training. You have a team of scouts who can be sent out to investigate other clubs, giving ideas on potential signings and helping you plan for future matches. A full squad of young players who could potentially challenge for the first team are on offer as well.

You can directly interact with your players, and also recieve newspaper reports assessing your team's performance. The matches are represented by fully-animated match footage, which is of a comparable visual standard to Krisalis' arcade football games.</desc>

		<desc>Formula One racing is recreated in detail in this simulation. You have the choice to drive a Ferrari 187/88C, a McLaren MP4/4 or a Williams FW12, each with different qualities. Rival drivers also have their own styles and strengths, and to win the World Championship you will have to master these. Pitstop timing and planning is crucial as well, although only tires are changed in late-1980s F1.

You can choose whether to drive a single race at Brazil, Britain, Monaco, (Western) Germany [Hockenheim], Canada, Italy, Detroit and Japan [Suzuka] or to drive a full championship on every track. Every Race includes a qualifying round. The graphics in the game are sprite-based.</desc>

		<desc>A motorcycle racing game recreating the now-defunct 80cc world motorcycle racing championship. It was licensed around Spanish ace Jorge Martinez 'Aspar', and your (and his) racing rivals including future 500cc World Champion Alex Criville.

The game features a full practice mode as well as qualifying and races. There are only 8 computer bikes, although the real life championship points system is used, meaning that the penalty for not finishing is bigger than in real life, especially as you only have 5 bikes to last the season. The game is viewed from overhead, and the controls are, unusually, direction based, so to take a straight which (in the overhead view) involves going up and to the right, you must push the joystick in that direction.</desc>

		<desc>An indelible memory for the entire '80s cohort of UK schoolchildren, this educational game, originally released in 1983 on the BBC Micro, solicits textual input from the player regarding the correct approach and technique for rescuing three pairs of royal children from a wicked witch. A variety of puzzle types with a wide and whimsical supporting cast kept classes of kids debating the correct course of action through an array of different environments, progress through each tracked courtesy of a password system.

Some 15 or so years later, the game's developers eventually released a multimedia-enhanced remake of it for modern operating systems.</desc>

Unfortunately, Catheter gets word of your plans, and mixes up a whole new batch of vicious gremlins. As a result, your mission is now one of destruction and avoidance.

Elite's implementation of this is a five-level side-view action game, in which you run around avoiding or shooting the gremlins. Each level has a secret object which must be collected. Bonus items such as extra lives and time can be collected, as can improved weapons, and credits to spend on a new weapon after each level.</desc>

		<desc>Grid Start is a Formula 1 racing game played from a third person perspective similar to Pole Position. The game consists of six tracks based on real world locations: Brands Hatch, Silverstone, Belgium, Mexico, Austria and Germany. These can be played in a competition consisting of three laps or in a practice mode with 99 laps (or until the player presses the escape key). In each race there are 23 AI controlled cars to compete against. The game is playable in three difficulties: novice, amateur and professional. The car has six gears that have to be changed manually and a boost feature can also be used for faster acceleration. In addition to racing faster than the opposing drivers the player also has to avoid crashing into the haystacks and the fences that are placed dangerously close to the track.</desc>

The game features "extremely atmospheric" descriptions and 30 artistic renditions of key locations. Included in the game package are a faux newsletter of the Guild of Thieves titled What Burglar providing instructions and hints for the game, a Bank of Kerovnia Trading Account Card, a guild contract detailing the arrangement between the player's character and the Guild of Thieves and small dice.</desc>

		<desc>Gunship depicts one of the Western world's finest attack helicopters: The AH-64A Apache. This simulation recreates the weapons, flight systems, and performance of the real machine. The player controls an arsenal that includes laser-guided Hellfire missiles, a 30mm cannon controlled by helmet gunsights, clusters of bombardment rockets--even air-to-air missiles for duels with enemy helicopters.

The game starts with flight training at a base in the United States. Tutorials teach the player to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.</desc>

		<desc>Take the Apache, the new Longbow Apache, The Blackhawk, Comanche Scout, Comanche Gunship, or the MD-500 Defender on campaigns or missions. Updated graphics engine has much more detailed terrain variation with true valleys/hills and even train tunnels that you can fly through. When you are promoted to a sufficient rank you can take along multiple helicopters to accomplish your objectives. The dynamic campaign generates new missions based on multiple maps. Attack, defend, sweep, scout, rescue, drop... Lots of missions to keep you busy. Crew learn and grow in experience as they survive and succeed. A full mission recorder allows you to view EVERY member of your team as they fight or die. Plenty of weapons are available for your side from the latest Hellfire missiles and Sidearm anti-radar missiles to the old fashioned chain gun and gun pods are available for your use. The enemy can be well armed as well, from deadly 2S6 gun/missile combo to old-fashion ZSU-23, even the occasional MiGs.</desc>

		<desc>Gunship depicts one of the Western world's finest attack helicopters: The AH-64A Apache. This simulation recreates the weapons, flight systems, and performance of the real machine. The player controls an arsenal that includes laser-guided Hellfire missiles, a 30mm cannon controlled by helmet gunsights, clusters of bombardment rockets--even air-to-air missiles for duels with enemy helicopters.

The game starts with flight training at a base in the United States. Tutorials teach the player to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.</desc>

		<desc>A complete clone of Bank Panic (West Bank). You are the hero John Brayn with the order to protect the bank of Laramie. There are 12 doors through which bandits or innocents could appear. Shoot the bandits before they shoot you, and don't shoot the innocents.

There are gold coins to win if you shoot at them, but this is not always easy because some innocents have them in hand; so take care, good aim and good luck.</desc>

		<desc>Hostile All-Terrain Encounters await in this shoot 'em up notable for it's unusual diagonal scroll, which is similar to Costa Panayi's previous Highway Encounter series. As nobody is qualified to take the enemy on, your task is to complete the 30 levels of training (the actual war could've been the basis for a sequel, although this never happened).

The levels alternate between controlling a Star Fighter plane and a Ground Assault Vehicle; the latter is faster but is confined to ground motion. The plane can move up and down to make dodging the simulated enemy fire easier. This generally comes at you in waves, although there are also ground installations.

Central to the game is to shoot at the cases of plasma crystals, and then fly over these so as to carry them to the end of the level. Dying loses you one of these crystals if you have at least one, or a life if you do not. Completing a level with at least 2 crystals is effectively a restart point as well, as when you die you are sent back to a level in which you collected at least 2.</desc>

		<desc>Hacker is an adventure/trading game based on what was then a unique idea. You're starting into the adventure as a real hacker would do, lacking information of what is to come, only driven by your ambition. Consequently, the game opens with a plain text screen, prompting you for the login password. To break into the system is the first puzzle you've got to solve.

Once in, you'll soon find out that you've accidentally stumbled upon a conspiracy of global impact. From then on, you'll maneuver a robotic drone around the globe through a tunnel system deep in the earth. In major cities, you may surface and talk to contact persons, who'll trade items for cash. When delivered to the correct city, you can exchange these items for a piece of evidence. If all evidence is collected, you're to inform the FBI. As if figuring out the correct routes and trades wasn't hard enough, frequent system malfunctions and security checks test your skill as well...</desc>

		<desc>Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers is a real-time strategy game. It is the sequel to Hacker.

Once again you hack into a computer system, just to end up saving the world. Hacker II: The Doomsday Papers opens with the console to the "Actisource" computer hotline system (a nice self-ironic pun - although nobody knows why a serious hacker might want to crack a help service for computer games...). However, your quiet little hack is soon disturbed: The government wants you for a secret mission. It, again, involves a robot drone and you're the one at the remote control. Although this time, it's not the whole globe that's your playground, but a high security facility in Russia, where the plans for global domination are hidden.

In fact, all you've got to do is to guide your drone to the vault on a 2D map of the building. However, there are two major obstacles: Patrolling guards and security cameras. To avoid detection, you've got to trick the observers. By tapping the surveillance system you can see what cameras are currently active and which rooms they monitor. Your task is to bypass the video signal of the right cameras with a taped recording of an empty room, so that your drone is hidden from the view. You control four monitors, which you may freely switch to show the security monitor, the radar map, VCR output or one of the 38 cameras -- thus keeping an eye on guard movement while simultaneously controlling your drone and synchronizing recordings to cameras. Whew, sounds like a lot of work? It is.</desc>

		<desc>Hammer Boy is an arcade game that plays like a cross between Kaboom! and Whac-A-Mole.

Armed with a big hammer, your job is to prevent the American Indians from reaching the tower behind your fort by hitting them on the head and putting out the fires that are thrown from the side. That's really it to the game -- new levels bring different backgrounds (battleship, castle and space base) with corresponding enemies (pirates, knights and aliens), but essentially the same gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Hard Drivin' is a 3D arcade hit from Atari Games. You are in control of a high-performance sports car. Your objective is to race around the course as fast as possible and hit as many checkpoints as possible. If you hit a checkpoint you gain extra time to go farther. You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass...

The course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on.

Crashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is "reset" and you get up to speed again.

The home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.</desc>

		<desc>A bi-directional horizontally scrolling platform game, Hawkeye has the player in control of an SLF (Synthetic Life Form) controlled from an underground bunker by the Xamoxians. On each level, the eyes of the hawks in the status panel flash to indicate the direction to travel in to find a puzzle piece. Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level.

The player has a choice of four different weapons. The basic pistol had unlimited ammo but did little damage. The machine gun had a faster rate of fire, the laser did more damage and most powerful of all was the rocket launcher - but all three soon ran out of ammo.

The game features parallax scrolling backgrounds and large numbers of enemies (including large rhinos, triceratops and gorillas).</desc>

		<desc>Two distinct characters called Mr Head and Mr Heels are played in this arcade adventure. They are separated at the shoulders but capable of joining together to maximize their abilities in some situations (but reduce them in others, so they can be split again).

The game is presented from an isometric perspective, and presents the characters with a number of puzzles involving switches, jumps and climbs. The levels are 3 dimensional, and the characters must collect crowns as they progress. Objects can be picked up and manipulated as necessary.</desc>

		<desc>Kate, the daughter of a wealthy businessman named E.A. Lomax, is abducted by a Chinese warlord named Li Deng near Chengdu, where she was volunteering as a nurse. Lomax recruits the former World War I fighter pilot Jake "Lucky" Masters for a dangerous mission: travel to Hong-Kong, locate a mysterious ninja, and find a way to infiltrate Li Deng's fortress and rescue Kate.

Heart of China is an adventure game with a romantic theme somewhat reminiscent of films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark. The game is set during the 1930's in China as well as a few other locations. It uses a simple point-and-click system for interaction and object manipulation, and is very similar visually and gameplay-wise to Rise of the Dragon. 

Some of the tasks in the game have multiple solutions, allowing the player to pursue different methods and choose different responses in branching dialogues. However, some choices may lead to the protagonist's death or bring the investigation to a dead end. There are also a few arcade sequences, which can be skipped if the player fails to complete them after several tries. The game utilizes digitized photos of live actors superimposed on hand-painted graphics.</desc>

		<desc>This multi-genre military action game puts player in the seat of tactical commander of mechanized forces. Starting as Cadet, you'll raise your career from the rookie, when you should perform actions by yourself in different vehicles, to the ultimate elite, when you should act as a Tactical genius.

There are three kinds of combat simulations:

    MBT (main battle tank M1A1 Abrams), where in first-person view you should sit in tank's cockpit, command your gunner and driver, and eliminate surrounding enemies;

    FAV (fast attack vehicle XR311), where in third-person view you should drive your vehicle in desert, shoot scattered obstacles and enemy helicopters, and avoid the bombs dropped from the skies ;

    ADAT (air defense anti-tank M1132A), where in first-person view you should shoot air and ground enemies, surrounding your statical position.

Performing useful actions in each mode, you'll gain points, and gathering 5,000 points in each mode will give you a seat of Tactical Commander. Here you'll be able to continue your actions on the field, or perform some tactical moves using the map, which is very similar to the territory, including and surrounding Western Germany.</desc>

		<desc>Heimdall is an action-adventure computer game developed by a team called The 8th Day and published by Core Design.

The game is set in the world of Vikings and Norse mythology. Loki steals Odin's sword, Freyr's spear and Thor's hammer, rendering them powerless. They decide to create an infant, the title character (named after the god of the same name), who must bring back the three legendary weapons.

The game sees Heimdall and his crew travelling around an archipelago of islands in three different maps: Utgard, Midgard and Asgard. They travel engaging monsters in combat, interacting with the locals, solving puzzles and avoiding traps, a blend of styles somewhat similar to that found in the Legend of Zelda games. The cartoon-style action is viewed in the isometric perspective.</desc>

		<desc>The alien race Hellraisers seized the planet Hazbal which is an important junction of space trade routes. The player's job is to drive them out of the system. The game consists of six levels with two alternating gameplay mechanics. In the first, third and fifth level the player controls the mercenary himself who walks and jumps through the side-scrolling levels. With his weapon he shoots everything that moves and uses teleporters and holes to find his way. The other levels are horizontally shooters in a top-down perspective. The player controls a space ship, moves through the levels and shoots everything that moves. Killed enemies may leave symbols behind which give advantages when picked up.</desc>

		<desc>Your SuperCobra assault helicopter is the most advanced of its kind, oozing with missiles and full of power, ready to blow everything in its path into the weeds. All it needs now is a capable pilot; hopefully you can fit the bill.

The action is spread over day and night levels, across different types of terrain. On each level you must destroy a set number of aircraft to move onto the next level - otherwise the level loops back to the start. Extra lives can be collected throughout, and your plane is armed with smart bombs to use when the action is especially hectic.</desc>

Only your HMS Raider can collect diamonds. There are four fighters inside your Raider, called Orbitals. You can use them to survey the area and destroy enemies while your mothership keeps collecting diamonds automatically or by another player. If orbital is used, camera follows it, so stay close to Raider if another player is controlling it. It is hard to collect diamonds if can't see them or yourself)</desc>

		<desc>The famous fantasy-themed board game was converted into an isometric-viewed role playing game in which the evil Wizard Morcar must be defeated. You take control of a wizard, a dwarf, a barbarian and an elf, each with different strengths and weaknesses, who each start the 14 missions from opposite sides of the board.

Strict turn-based movement rules apply, as actions other than movement can only be carried out before or after the move, the size of which is limited by a dice roll. These moves are carried out using an icon-based system. Characters can fight the many monsters which lurk, or cast spells to vanquish them. There are magic potions to uncover, but also hidden traps, so mapping is advised. Treasure can be collected, and traded at the shop after each level.</desc>

		<desc>The isometric role-playing game engine of the original HeroQuest license is reused in this sequel, set in the evil-infested land of Rhia. There are now 9 large missions to take on, with a largely linear progression in the order these are played. You can choose a team of 4 from 8 character classes, adding rangers, mystics, elves and clerics to the original game's 4. The exact abilities of these can be customized before you start.

The game is controlled using action icons at the bottom of a screen to set the basic instructions to move, fight, open doors, search for keys and so on. Characters can move individually, allowing for diverse strategies based on the specific strengths and weaknesses of these characters.</desc>

		<desc>In Highway Patrol II, players assume the role of a police officer trying to capture runaway felons before they reach the county border. Players begin by choosing a target villain, with tougher ones earning a bigger bonus, and making it easier to achieve promotions. Gameplay is from the officer's viewpoint, looking through the windshield of his cruiser.

Players chase the criminals and must get them to pull over by using intimidation (siren) or force (shotgun). Players navigate to the criminal's whereabouts by use of the compass and map. Chasing the villain often means venturing off the road and driving through the desert. Traffic is the most obvious hazard in the game, contact with innocents cost promotion points. Other difficulties include: a flat tire, gangsters shooting back, running out of gas, or engine failure due to heat.</desc>

		<desc>Hill Street Blues is a top-down action / strategy mix.

&#x201C;Let&#x2019;s be careful out there!&#x201D;

Based on the &#x2018;80s TV drama series Hill Street Blues, this game puts you in the role of Captain Furillo of the Hill Street police department. Crime rates are soaring in the precinct, and it&#x2019;s up to your team of nine officers (all well-known from the series and with digitized portraits) to keep the streets safe.

Your officers move on foot or by car on a 2D top-down map of the city, complete with real-time traffic. True to the series, each day starts with a roll call from Sgt. Esterhaus. Once on duty, listen to radio operator A.J. Hill report crimes every few minutes. Deploy officers to the scene, help the victim and call an ambulance or coroner; next, identify and find the suspect. Some criminals may flee, others even shoot at you. Give chase or open fire if necessary. When the bad guy is arrested, a court trial may follow.

Hill Street Blues is controlled entirely with the mouse via a set of icons &#x2013; that&#x2019;s everything but intuitive, especially when directing a single officer through the streets. Since there will soon be multiple crimes all over the city, the challenge is to co-ordinate multiple officers simultaneously and keep track of cases and suspects. If your success rate is high enough, you will ultimately be promoted to chief of police.</desc>

		<desc>Play a would-be hero in the city of Hillsfar, where action and adventure await the daring adventurer. Join the local guild and complete missions from the guild master in a quest for glory and gold!

Hillsfar is a single-hero role-playing game (in comparison to other Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing games, where the player usually controls a group of characters). A combination of first person perspective (when traveling in the city of Hillsfar) and third person perspective (usually in some action-style mini-quests) viewpoints.

As a would-be-hero, four classes are available in a randomly generated mission-based plot: fighter, thief, cleric, or magic-user. Each class to a certain extent, have different assigned quests given by each respective guild.

In Hillsfar, gameplay usually consists of various mini-games that are needed to complete the quests or missions provided at the local guild by the guild master. These mini-games (and their viewpoints) include:

    Fighting in the arena (third person).
    Competing at the archery range (first person).
    Exploring buildings or mazes (top-down).
    Riding a horse outside Hillsfar while avoiding obstacles (third person/side-scrolling).
    Locking picking doors and chests (first person). 

Unlike most role-playing games, there aren't any randomly generated monsters to battle. In Hillsfar, combat only occurs in the arena.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2712, and four mercenaries have been sent to the planet Graveyard on a hostage rescue mission. Upon arriving, however, they discover that the call for help was just an excuse to lure them into proving grounds, where they will have to fight genetically engineered creatures.

Hired Guns is an action RPG using square-based movements, &#xE0; la Dungeon Master, in which up to four players can take part and set in a futuristic setting. The screen is split into 4 parts (or 3 in case 3 players play together), each one representing the viewpoint of the characters, these being selected from a team of 12 available mercenaries.

If one player plays alone, he will control all 4 characters, using the mouse to navigate between each character viewpoints. A follow mode is available to avoid tedious numerous amounts of clicking when moving several characters. If two players play together, then each player will use a mouse to control two characters.

In three or four-player mode, players can freely choose to control their characters via either a joystick/joypad or some of the predefined keyboard layouts or a mouse. When 4 people play together, the screen will display 4 viewpoints, like in 1 and 2-player modes. In 3-player mode, the top of the screen displays two viewpoints for player 1 and 2, but the lower part of the screen displays a single viewpoint, centered, for player 3.

Three game modes are available.
The Training mode features 5 simple maps on which the player(s) can learn how to move, use inventory items etc...

The Full Campaign mode takes the player(s) to the far reaches of the Luyten planetary system, on the planet Graveyard. Battling through more than 20 theaters of engagement, your team of mercenaries test their limits of military prowess in order to wipe out all threats on the planet surface. To this end, they have to make their way through the different missions and gather 4 fusion power core rings, before entering the final mission in the Spaceport.

Finally, in Short Action game mode, the player(s) can choose between 17 maps. On those maps, the player(s) will have to fight some enemies to reach the exit within a specified time limit. Additionally, when more than one player takes part in the mission, players will compete with each other since only the first to reach the exit will win.</desc>

		<desc>The storyline takes the player through various battles of World War I. The player can choose to play either the French or German side. The game starts in August 1914, with Germany invading France. As during the real war, the open greenfields of the first battles, dominated by cavalry, are gradually replaced by terrain filled with trenches and bunkers; as the number of tanks, artillery and aeroplanes increases the cavalry and infantry troops become less effective. New units become available as the game progresses, such as A7V or Mark IV tanks.

The game includes a lot of information about the period: after each mission, historical facts about two months of wartime are displayed. The game was designed to be educational, starting with an animation depicting the Western Front in 1916, and a sequence showing the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, whose assassination in Sarajevo precipitated the Austrian declaration of war against Serbia which triggered World War I. After completing each map the player receives information about the course of the war (the game is linear - it is impossible to change history). The information includes text and illustrations taken from contemporary newspapers, both on key historical events and on trivial domestic news such as sporting events. There are also some animations, such as a zeppelin on a bombing raid London Bridge.</desc>

		<desc>You are Arthur Dent, an Englishman with a bad hangover wearing a dressing gown containing a much needed buffered analgesic and some fluff. Your house has just been destroyed, followed shortly thereafter by your planet Earth (mostly harmless). You&#x2019;ve been rescued by your friend Ford Prefect, who&#x2019;s not actually an out-of-work actor. He has given you a book (The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy), a towel, and is now telling you to put a fish in your ear. It must be a Thursday; you&#x2019;ve never quite gotten the hang of Thursdays.

The Hitchhiker&#x2019;s Guide to the Galaxy is written by Douglas Adams and Steven Meretzky and based on Adams&#x2019; BBC radio series, television series, and the series of subsequent novelizations. It&#x2019;s one of the classic Interactive Fiction games produced by Infocom, labeled as Science Fiction and has a Standard Level of Difficulty. Though divergent from the source material, the main characters, locations, and concepts are here. Unlike the book, death can come quickly if Arthur fails to observe his surroundings, collect inventory, talk to people, and consult the Guide. DON&#x2019;T PANIC!

Original C=64 Grey Box Contents: Megadodo Publications Advertising Booklet for your very own Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy complete with Fluff, Destruct orders for your home and planet, a nice red button with the words DON'T PANIC printed in large yellow letters, a pair of Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril-Sensitive Sunglasses, No Tea, and your very own Microscopic Space Fleet. All this can be yours, for the low, low price of only 59.99 Altairian Dollars.</desc>

		<desc>Hole-In-One Miniature Golf provides an overhead view of each hole. The game play is controlled entirely with the mouse. You place the ball on the starting pad and click the left mouse button. Once you have placed the ball, "stretch" a line from the ball to the pointer. The direction the line is pointing is the direction the ball will go. The length of the line or the distance between the pointer and the ball is relative to the power on the shot. Once you are satisfied, click the left mouse button to putt the ball. 

You are allowed to go three shots over par. Any more than that and you will get a penalty stroke and must advance to the next hole (or player). You can also get one stroke penalty for going into a water hazard. Your scorecard will be displayed after the first nine holes but can be viewed at anytime using the Options Menu. After completing the course the scorecard will be displayed again. You can print your scores or exit to continue. 

The game features five complete 18-hole courses with different themes including a Tutorial Course that walks the player through every aspect of game play, a Classics Course which is patterned after the basic traditional miniature golf course, an Intermediate Course that adds more obstacles, elevations and difficulty, an adventurous Fantasy Course with designs ranging from castles to pinball and the Expert Course for those who master the game. The game can be installed on a hard drive.</desc>

		<desc>The Amy Putt Classics is an 18-hole mini-golf course game for 1 to 4 players. You hit the ball by clicking the mouse in the direction that you want the ball to go, relative to where it currently is, using the distance from ball to the mouse cursor to indicate how hard to hit it. Hazards include sand traps, tunnels and tubes, running water, and a windmill where you have to get the timing right to knock the ball between the spinning blades. The view is top-down, and contours in the course are represented using shades of color: the lowest parts are dark green, gradually changing to a lighter green to indicate an upward incline.</desc>

		<desc>This is a platform game based on the movie "Home Alone". Kevin's family went on vacation, but they forgot about him, so now he's home alone. Now there are two burglars who want to break into the house. Kevin has to prevent the burglars from kidnapping him, by riddling the house with traps.

The player controls Kevin through the mansion in a side perspective. He has one hour before the burglars will break into the house. In this hour, the player has to set up various traps in order to make the burglars give up on capturing Kevin. After this hour, the burglars break in, and the traps become active. Each trap deals 5 damage to a burglar, and the first shot of Kevin's BB gun deals another 5. During this phase, the screen always tells in which room each burglar is at the moment. The game is won by dealing 50 damage to each burglar.</desc>

		<desc>Peter Banning is an ordinary suburban dad with two kids - or so everyone thinks. What not even his family know is his past as Peter Pan, scourge of Captain Hook in JM Barrie's children's fiction. Captain Hook gains revenge on Banning by stealing his two children, so Peter must return to Neverland, return to eternal childhood, and get them back.

It's a point and click adventure, and the pirate setting ensures that it recalls the Monkey Island games. The top 2/3 of the screen features a visual depiction of the area Peter is in, which a row of icons along the bottom can be selected to alter the function of a mouse click. These include looking at an object, picking it up, talking to people, using objects to solve problems (often in combination with others), and giving objects to others.</desc>

		<desc>This is the original Microids title, which was exclusively used with the releases for the French game market. Released outside France under a different title, Hot Rubber by Titus UK.

Grand Prix 500 2 is your standard bike racing scenario, featuring a handful of riders racing hell for leather around the most famous courses of the world, pausing only to collect medals and shake champagne all over each other.

I must admit, I&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2;m a very big fan of bike racing games. From Team Suzuki to Super Hang On, I always have my eye out for a new one. This is quite definitely the most appalling one I have ever seen. It&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2;s completely unplayable in every respect, with a useless two player mode and some of the smallest player windows ever seen.

You begin as always on the starting grid and at this point things look really good. The graphics are fine and detailed and everything looks fairly realistic. Then the light turns green and the other riders hit the horizon in about three hops. Push forward to get moving and you hit this game&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2;s big problem. Rather than have you at the centre of the screen with the road swinging around as you change lanes, the programmers obviously decided that that was too much hassle, and opted for the other side of the coin, which involves the road being centred and the sprite of the bike moving around unrealistically. The result of this is that it&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2;s impossible to judge corners correctly, and as for overtaking - forget it.

This is one useless game. Even as a budget title, it just isn&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2;t worth the disk it&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x201E;&#xA2;s recorded on.</desc>

		<desc>A simple two-player game released to much marketing fanfare, Hotshot places you and another player (either another person or an AI robot) in an arena split down the middle into two save for a hole about half the screen's height for the ball to travel through, with a series of bricks on each side to destroy.

The aim of the game is to destroy your own bricks before your opponent can destroy his. This is achieved by catching the small by pointing your suction device at it and holding fire, and then releasing in the needed by letting go of the button. This is easier said than done, as the ball neither moves in a straight line or according to the natural rules of.gravity.

Should either player be hit with the ball and not catch it properly, they will be knocked down and possession of the ball is passed to the other player.

		<desc>Based on the famous animated series created by Hanna-Barbera Productions about sweet blue dog Huckleberry 'Huck' Hound that speaks with southern drawl and wants to find the appropriate job.

So Huck as amateur Hollywood actor should complete many acts in the different scenes (Under World, Sea World, Canyon World, and Sky World), which may be available later by entering the proper code, using three takes.

The goal of gameplay is to clear each level of diamonds (increasing your score), hearts (increasing your bone energy), and Oscar (increasing your score also) jumping from the bottom of the level to its top and vice versa. Different obstacles such as lethal drops, flying balls, sticky, icy, or moving ground, teleports, inhabitants of the four Worlds, etc. are present on your way, and your jumping skill allows you to avoid them. Your take is finished if you loose your current bone energy. 

Highest score will be stored. After completing the game once you may replay it again, but the gameplay will be harder. Bonus level is also available.</desc>

		<desc>Zoo keepers from an alien world have scoured human history to steal 7 important figures from different epochs, and it is your job to rescue them. First you will have to explore four worlds to find the 6 pieces of their Time Machine, avoiding the chasing aliens.

Unlike Humans 2, this is a full sequel to the game known as Evolution: Dino Dudes on some systems with a new game engine, rather than merely a data disk with new levels. 

As before the gameplay is influenced by Lemmings. Each of your characters have their own abilities, including fire-creation, grabbing and smashing, which must be used in conjunction to beat the puzzles before you. Passwords are offered for each level.</desc>

		<desc>You're one of an an elite band of soldiers pitted against an overwhelming enemy who controls most of the world. Take on various missions ranging from assassination to demolition in an effort to defeat the enemy within a time limit.

Fully 3D, you have the choice to go anywhere you please during any mission. A focus is put on freedom of choice; there's no one way to complete a mission. You can take control of any vehicle in the game, and these range from riding pedal bikes and windsurfing, to vans and ambulances, to tanks and armoured cars, to battleships and helicopters. Your arsenal includes grenades, explosives, various gadgets and a handgun, though deadlier weapons are mounted on some of the vehicles. Or if you prefer, you can acquire an enemy uniform and sneak in rather than blast your way through.

There are also many structures to be found, many containing regular citizens who may be interacted with (talking to them, bribing them...), though there are also more specialised structures which may contain vehicles, ammo, or anything you might find useful to your mission.</desc>

		<desc>Hybris is a classic vertically scrolling shoot-em-up which has its roots firmly with arcade stalwarts like Capcom's 1942.

The back story takes place in 2461 A. D. and concerns an Earth colony being lost on an alien planet known as Jurica. The space station Hybris cannot establish communications with the colony. So a scout ship must be sent on a rescue mission over this seemingly desolate desert-like expanse to find the colonists, and subsequently return them to safety. Warning: Inbound Hostiles . .!

The game is for one, and the player can select from two Ace pilots - J.P. Maverick or K. Lovett. You navigate the scout ship around the screen at will. The aim is to shoot everything that moves, whilst outmanoeuvring enemy fire. One contends with spiralling waves of alien nasties which move into the play area from multiple direction's something akin to Galaga, as well as stationary gun turrets &amp; other surface installations that periodically spew projectiles.

At times a power cube bonus will drift onto the screen. Which upon being shot by the player, will reveal a strength upgrade feature for the scout ship. Each subsequent upgrade collected will progressively beef up the ship (which is visually realised in real-time), in turn increasing your firepower. The scout ship can also be expanded on the fly into unique power configurations attributed to which cube bonus has been collected. You also have control of a smart-bomb feature which can relieve sticky situations.</desc>

		<desc>The training as fighter pilot for the Federation took five years. Now you are finished. But there is a final test to master: survive the Hyperdome.

The player is thrown in the Hyperdome with his space ship, the landscape is scrolling horizontally, and to survive, you have to shoot everything in sight. Your ship is equipped with a basic laser cannon. Luckily, some opponents drop collectible markers, which increase a counter visible on the right side of the screen. If you reached the weapon or bonus of your choice, you can activate it. There are nine extras available: increased ship speed, increased fire power, double fire, missiles, spread (clears in front), homing missiles, a satellite and a shield. If you loose one of your initially nine lives, the current extra weapon is gone. If you collect too many items without activating a weapon, the count is set back to the first bonus.

Of course, your ship is crashing if the landscape blocks are touched - this is integral part of the design, as some levels build up less on shooting, but avoiding and securely navigating through the many obstacles on the way.</desc>

		<desc>Monty Mole has been living in luxury since his previous adventures, but he has now been beamed up by an alien race who want him to do a job for them. Monty must trek through five worlds to retrieve the sacred scrolls of the race's Guardians.

As with Core's previous hit Rick Dangerous 2 there is versatility in the exact structure of the game. The first four levels consist of the Orient, a Klondike mine, an Ice world and an Amazon forest - once these are completed the final world is open to you.

The platform-based gameplay is similar to Monty's earlier games, with primarily horizontal progression, as well as ropes and ladders to navigate. Monty has developed a useful flying kick, and has been given a smart bomb, with the potential to collect extra bombs and guns. Hazards, enemies and level designs are themed around each level, and range from cable cars and falling snowballs to Ninjas and Monkeys.</desc>

Gameplay is puzzle-oriented as before, although the levels are now scrolling, and as such much larger than before. Each one contains objects to pick up to enable you to take on the level's final puzzle of putting them together in sliding-block form. There are lots of bonus games, ranging from a Simon title to standard shoot 'em ups.

You play a crash test dummy, trying to progress through levels filled with hazards such as cars and fireballs, within the time limits. Contact with each of these loses you a limb, and once you have none left, contact means game over. Since the character isn't handicapped by missing limbs in any way, in practical terms you can think of these as hit points especially as there are screwdrivers to pick up which restore one limb.</desc>

		<desc>Indiana Jones is back! The great archaeologist and adventurer has to solve a grand mystery once again, aided by his trusty whip, his sharp wit, and his courage. A man who calls himself Mr. Smith is interested in a certain ancient statue. When the unsuspecting Indy hands it over to the client, he finds out that Mr. Smith is in fact a colonel in the Nazi army! Why was he so interested in that statue? A girl who had once worked together with Indy, the pretty red-haired (and a bit troublesome) Sophia, tells him the whole thing must have a connection with the legendary lost continent Atlantis. Gathering clues from all over the world, Indy and Sophia embark on their greatest journey!

Fate of Atlantis is not a movie spin-off, but an independent adventure with a brand new story. The gameplay utilizes LucasArts' famous SCUMM system, with action verbs the player chooses from a menu; the objects that can be interacted with are highlighted. The game contains many puzzles of various kinds (mostly inventory-based) and dialogues with multiple choices. There are also a couple of hand-to-hand fights against the Nazis. The middle part of the game can be played in three "modes": co-operation (Indy and Sophia), adventure (Indy alone), and action (Indy alone, with less puzzles and more action). In each mode there are different locations to visit, different puzzles to solve, and different characters to meet.

		<desc>Being an action title, the game starts off where Indy is about to have an excuse to use his trusty whip: in Monte Carlo, after he recruited headstrong former student Sophie to his aid and determined the location of ancient discs needed to open the door to the lost city of Atlantis. Most action takes place in isometric view, although there are some variations along the way to keep up interest. There are even some adventure-game elements, such as Indy's inventory which you can fill with various objects to use (i.e. money to buy things). They are mostly easy though, and are there only to relieve the tension from knuckle-blistering action.</desc>

		<desc>As in the movie (and the more famous graphic adventure), your task is to find the Holy Grail. Before this can be done you must find the Cross of Coronado, a shield and a diary. 

This makes for a four-level arcade adventure combining climbs, exploration (with several routes through each level, and some traps) and puzzles. Indy is armed with his trusty whip to fight off foes, but can also get involved in hand-to-hand combat. The first level takes place in caves underneath Colorado, before you reach a moving circus train strewn with traps, a Zeppelin which is full of guards and ladders, and then Castle Grunwald in Austria.</desc>

		<desc>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure is a graphic adventure game, originally released in 1989 (to coincide with the release of the film of the same name), published by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts). It was the third game to use the SCUMM engine.

The plot closely follows, and expands upon, the film of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. As the game begins, Indiana Jones has returned to his college, after reclaiming the Cross of Coronado. He is approached by businessman Walter Donovan, who tells him about the Holy Grail, and of the disappearance of Indy's father.

Indy then travels to some of the places seen in the movie, such as Venice and the catacombs, after meeting fellow archeologist Elsa Schneider. In the process he finds his father held captive in the Brunwald Castle, after passing through the mazelike corridors, fighting and avoiding guards. Then Elsa's double role is revealed when she steals the Grail Diary from Indy. After escaping, father and son pass through Berlin to reclaim the Diary and have a brief meeting with Hitler. Then they reach an airport, from where they intend to seek the Valley of the Crescent Moon, by Zeppelin or biplane. There are many action scenes, involving fists, and the biplane sequence above Europe, pursued by Nazi planes.

Several key elements of the movie&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D;such as the Brotherhood of the Grail, Indy's friend Sallah, and the Venice water chase and the desert battle scenes (except for small hidden references)&#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D;were not included in the game.

Last Crusade was one of the most innovative of the LucasArts adventures. It expanded on LucasArts' traditional adventure game structure by including a flexible point system - the IQ score, or "Indy Quotient" - and by allowing the game to be completed in several different ways. The point system was similar to that of Sierra's adventure games, however when the game was restarted or restored, the total IQ of your previous game was retained. The only way to reach the maximum IQ of 800 was by finding alternative solutions to puzzles, such as fighting a guard instead of avoiding him. This countered one common criticism of adventures games, whereby since there is only one way to finish the game, they have no replay value. Some of the alternative fights, such as the one with the Zeppelin attendant, were very difficult to pass, so the maximum IQ was very difficult to acquire.

The game was released in May 1989 simultaneously with the movie. It was available for </desc>

		<desc>The computer versions of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom are conversions of the Atari arcade game based on the second movie in the series. As Indy, the player must complete several cycles of the following three types of levels:

Mine level: Whip your way through a mine in order to free children that are held captive. Use your whip to swing across chasms, climb ladders, ride along conveyor belts and defend yourself against attacks from Thuggee guards, bats, snakes and the fireball-throwing Mola ram. Escape with the mine cart after you've freed all children.
    
Mine cart level: Pick the right route through a network of tracks while riding in a mine cart. Avoid potholes, broken tracks &amp; guards in carts and safely reach the end of the track.
    
Temple level: Make your way to the altar and grab the Sankara stone while Mola Ram, bats and Thuggee guards attack you. Watch out for that lava.</desc>

		<desc>Indianapolis 500: The Simulation is a 1989 computer game. It was hailed as the first step of differentiating racing games from the arcade realm and into racing simulation.[1] It was developed by the Papyrus Design Group, consisting of David Kaemmer and Omar Khudari,[2] and distributed by Electronic Arts. It first released for DOS and later for the Amiga in 1990.

Indianapolis 500: The Simulation attempts to be a full simulation of the Indianapolis 500 race, with 33 cars and appropriate Indy car "feel". While racing, it only offers a first-person perspective, but the game offers a replay mode as well. Indy 500 offers the ability to realistically set up the car, and any changes made to the car directly affect how it handles.

The field is represented as realistic and the qualifying order stays true to the 1989 Indianapolis 500 starting grid, with one exception: the player's car, numbered 17, replaces Car #29 of Rich Vogler, who qualified in 33rd and last place.</desc>

		<desc>Indy Heat is a multi-player, top down racing game which began packing gangs of boy racers into the arcades a few years back. The Sales Curve's conversion allows three players to drive at once -you'll have to draw straws though, 'cos only two of them can use joysticks, player three being lumbered with the keyboard. The fourth car is computer-controlled, and tears around setting the pace.

Each player has a budget to spend on upgrading their car. There are boosters to be had for six different components: Tyres, Engine, Brakes, MPG (which improves fuel efficiency), Pit-Crew (which speeds up your pit-stops), and Turbo's (which give you an extra temporary boost of speed). There are ten different circuits, each one based on a real American race track. Before each race you're shown a map of the layout, which you can study to decide how your money would be best spent. A ridiculously simple track like Indianapolis will need a different combination of extras than one of the twisty, turny circuits. Don't worry if you can't decide what to buy, though - you can get the computer to choose for you.

When you're racing, the controls arc dead simple - left and right to steer, fire to go, and forward for a quick turbo boost. Your fuel supply and the number of remaining turbo boosts are shown on screen. Before your fuel runs out, a digitized voice and a little chappie holding up a placard lets you know it's pit-stop time. When you enter the pits, the crew rush around filling up the tank, replacing your turbo's and emptying the ash-trays. After a few seconds, the jacks come away and, pausing only to stash your free wine glasses, you can wheel-spin off again.

The overall winner is decided at the end of the tournament, when you're each told your average speed. Did you travel at a constant, fuel-efficient 55mph, or did you manage to clock up the sort of speeds that even Viscount Linley would be arrested for? Only the computer knows for sure.</desc>

		<desc>Inertia Drive is a multi directional scrolling shoot 'em up viewed from a top down perspective. Each of the game's levels consists of a number of gatepods as well as a central installation. The objective is to hit the central installation, but to open up its shields all the gatepods first have to be destroyed. Both gatepods and the central installations have shields with only a small gap to shoot through. In addition to these there are also gate protectors that move after the player in an attempt to crash into him. In addition to avoiding these, the player also has to avoid crashing into the shields as any contact will lead to a lost life. As the title suggests, the ship controls are affected by inertia. This means that once it has started moving in one direction a force in the opposite direction is needed for it to stop.</desc>

		<desc>Innocent Until Caught is a graphic adventure game with an icon-based point-and-click interface.

Jack T. Ladd is a thief, his hunting-ground is the whole galaxy, and at the moment, he's in big trouble. He's got 28 days to pay his taxes - or else the interstellar tax agency will hunt him down. Termination is a viable punishment for tax offenders in these days, you know. Stranded blank on the barren, run-down planet Tayte, Jack decides that he has to make some cash. Quick.

Innocent Until Caught is pretty standard in terms of design but introduces some innovations when it comes to the interface. It features a mini-window at the bottom left of the screen which is alternately a mini-map of the area (showing all exits) and a looking glass for detecting small items. The inventory is a box-window in which objects can be placed wherever player wants (even on top of others). Also, the plot is illustrated by a few rendered sequences, some of the first used in adventure games.</desc>

		<desc>You play the role of Insector Hecti, a computerised detective who explores and protects computer circuits. You have been sent to the Interchange, a highly sensitive area, which has been invaded by Victor Virus and his gang of bugs. On 50 circuits they have changed the direction of some of the blocks on each circuit and your task is to straighten them all back up. Viewed from above with each circuit shown on screen you must walk along the circuits to the misaligned pieces and turn them back round to the correct position and a ping sounds when it is in the correct position.

As you sort the circuit some of Victor's bugs roam the circuits as well and you can either avoid them, shoot them with limited balls or turn a piece of circuit round when they are next to it to destroy them. Once all the bugs have been destroyed they don't reappear. If you touch a bug, fall through a gap or fall of the edge of the circuit then you lose one of five lives and when all lives are gone it is game over. There is a password provided after every five levels to stop you repeating too many circuits. There is also a clock counting down and the circuit must be completed within the time. Occasionally some items appear to help you and these are extra balls, smart bomb, shield (limited), extra speed, freeze all bugs, extra time and stop timer.</desc>

		<desc>Insects in Space is a side-scrolling shooter with similarities to Defender. Insects killed everyone on Earth except a few babies. This causes the mystical leader of motherhood, St. Helen, to travel to Earth's remains and save the babies. The most important feature of this protagonist is the fact that she is topless and - as prominently mentioned in the manual - "big breasted", but she controls and shoots just like the space ship normally found in those games. 

The levels are side-scrolling and St. Helen can move in both directions. Additionally the levels are two screens high, the lower with a floor and the higher with a ceiling, which can be changed by leaving the current screen to the top respectively bottom. The babies are either positioned at the top or bottom level and are hunted by bees. Those bees pick them up, steal their life energy to create a new monster and drop them to the ground to die. The player's job is to kill the bees and save the babies. To help, a radar shows where in the level a kidnapping is in progress. Babies can be either returned to the ground for points or kept in Helen's grasp to convert them into power-ups eventually. Helen can also summon a dust cloud which teleports her near a bee target.</desc>

Every time a full enemy formation is shot, the game rewards it with a credit symbol which needs to be picked up in time. From time to time the player visits a shopping passage in which extras can be purchased from those credits, e.g. a turbo boost, extra lives or weapon upgrades. Those upgrades to not vanish after losing a life. Using a smart bombs also cost credits but don't need to be purchased first. The plot centers around the need to defeat alien invaders.</desc>

		<desc>In a dystopian cyberpunk future, The Dreamtrack Corporation has cornered the entertainment market, selling DreamTracks, dreamed or imagined adventures and experiences which can be enjoyed by consumers. The player is Chad, a DreamTrack Dreamer who has discovered that Dreamtrack Corporation is using the DreamTracks to destroy people's minds. He decides to break into Dreamtrack HQ. To overcome the high-tech security systems, his girlfriend, Kaf-E, agrees to break into the building physically, while Chad enters a virtual reality world, inspired by Neuromancer, in order to hack into and disable the computer-controlled defences.

The action mostly takes place in two modes: a 3D cyberpunk environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which pose a threat to the player's ability to jack in to the system, and which must be defeated.</desc>

		<desc>In a dystopian cyberpunk future, The Dreamtrack Corporation has cornered the entertainment market, selling DreamTracks, dreamed or imagined adventures and experiences which can be enjoyed by consumers. The player is Chad, a DreamTrack Dreamer who has discovered that Dreamtrack Corporation is using the DreamTracks to destroy people's minds. He decides to break into Dreamtrack HQ. To overcome the high-tech security systems, his girlfriend, Kaf-E, agrees to break into the building physically, while Chad enters a virtual reality world, inspired by Neuromancer, in order to hack into and disable the computer-controlled defences.

The action mostly takes place in two modes: a 3D cyberpunk environment and a 2D schematic map where puzzles are encountered. 3D objects in the cyberpunk environment represent objects such as security doors and cameras. To disable the real-world devices, the 3D objects must be destroyed. Puzzle-solving involves determining which objects to disable and in what order. The player must also deal with virtual defences, represented by enemy ships which pose a threat to the player's ability to jack in to the system, and which must be defeated.</desc>

		<desc>The player character is an Allied soldier whose orders are to infiltrate the top-secret Nazi fortress called the Eagle's Nest (which consists of four castles), rescue three Allied saboteurs being held there, save art treasures the Nazis have stolen, and then destroy the Nest with explosives.

A joystick is required for control, and the player depresses the firing button to fire the machine gun, which carries enough ammunition for 99 shots. Nazis require two well-placed shots to eliminate, and Nazis sitting at a table only require one well-placed shot. The player can sustain up to 50 shots from enemy soldiers. While inside the castles, the player finds crates which may contain art objects or explosives. The player can also find ammunition dumps, first-aid kits, and goods in the castles.</desc>

		<desc>Ishar 2 was published in 1993 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. In Ishar 2, the player starts with the character of Zubaran, who is the new lord of Ishar. He receives a vision that tells him to defeat the sorcerer Shandar. It is also possible to import a party of characters from the first Ishar. The game now takes place on an archipelago, each island bearing the name of one of Jarel's companions. Each island also features a different type of landscape: Irvan's island is covered with swamps, Akeer's and Otbar's are underground complexes, Zach's island is covered by a city, Jon's is mountainous, and Thorm's has treetop gangways in a forest.

This game has a combat system that's more ergonomic than in the first Ishar, and a day-night cycle in which shops are closed at night and the nightclub is closed by day. It also adds a bank. Saving the game does not remove gold from the player any more.</desc>

		<desc>The first game in the series came out in 1992 on Amiga, Atari ST and DOS. It takes place on the island of Kendoria. At the beginning, the player controls a warrior called Aramir, and he must defeat Krogh, an evil sorcerer who has killed lord Jarel. The game takes its name from Krogh's fortress, Ishar, whose name means "unknown" in the game's fictional elf language. In order to achieve this, the player's characters must travel across the whole island and, among other things, meet with the surviving companions of Jarel.

Most of Ishar takes place in an outdoor environment, which was original for computer roleplaying games of the time. It also featured a unique system to change the lineup of player characters: the player can have up to five characters at the same time, but each one will like or dislike his comrades. These preferences come into play when the player tries to recruit or dismiss a character, because the other characters will then vote for or against the recruitment or dismissal. If a character cannot be dismissed by a vote, it is possible for the player to have him assassinated by another character, but there is a risk that other characters will murder the murderer himself, possibly creating a chain of murders that slays the whole party but one.

This opus was the only one of the series that had gold removed from the party each time the player saved.

The band Summoning used the cover art of the game for their album Minas Morgul.</desc>

		<desc>Ishido is a solitaire board game played with tiles, similar to Shanghai. The objective is to place all of the tiles onto the board and obtain the highest possible score by following specific rules of play. There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature. Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match). 

There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</desc>

		<desc>The Island of Lost Hope is a text-adventure with a pirate theme. The parser has standard Infocom-like abilities: it understands pronouns, chain commands,etc. You play a character whose ship was attacked by a pirate called Captain Black. Stranded on a small island, one day you have the chance to infiltrate the captain's vessel and exact your revenge. The screen is divided in 5 parts: - a top-left porthole where the graphics and the odd animation are displayed; - a compass in the center in the form of a skull that can be clicked with the sword-shaped cursor for movement (its use is optional, the player can also type the cardinal points and the up and down directions directly on the parser screen); - a top-right map that shows your current position and the explored surrounding area; - the screen bottom, the larger part of it being reserved for the parser and its messages; - the smaller right-bottom inventory that lists your possessions. No music, but there is some sound, mostly soothing splash noises from the sea.</desc>

		<desc>The Incredible Shrinking Sphere of the title comes under your control in this isometric maze game which has similarities to Marble Madness and Spindizzy. The ball needs to be guided from the start of a level to the end, through 4 linked sections.

Various functioning squares must be used to your advantage. Uniquely these include changes to the ball's size, as well as it's physics. Revolving squares randomly fire the ball off in another direction, and ramps shoot you in the current direction at high speed. Weapons can be collected, as can shields - both of which are required to avoid some of the hazards on show. Black holes are always fatal however.</desc>

		<desc>It Came From the Desert is an action-adventure game that derives its inspiration from the many cult-horror B-Movies of the 50's and 60's, the 1954 film Them in particular. The player plays the part of Dr. Greg Bradley, a geologist and the newest resident in town. Eager to satisfy his scientific mind, Bradley sets out to examine the crash-site of a mysterious meteor, but what he finds is not at all what he had been looking for.

The game takes place all over Lizard Breath, and there are several different types of action / interaction. The adventure part of the game is very linear, guiding the player in a fairly set sequence of action sections. These include first-person bug shooting, scrolling overhead shooting, and a chase sequence.</desc>

You are Brick Nash, who has stolen plutonium and prevented nuclear tests in the desert, so the people are mad at you because they didn't get any money but some are friendly like Biff and Dusty. The police are after you and people in Lizard Breath are turning into antheads. The gameplay remains unchanged from the base game.</desc>

		<desc>In his second adventure James Pond must retrieve the toys Dr Maybe has stolen. Pond has been armed with an Inspector Gadget-style stretch device, which he can use to view higher areas or claw onto ceilings so as to slide across them.

The gameplay takes place across worlds themed around particular types of toys, such as sporting goods, candy and aircraft. The levels scroll sideways, although a small amount of vertical movement is included. On each level Pond must collect 2 penguins and reach the exit, although there are usually multiple exits and lots of secret areas to explore. After completing each pair of two worlds (each of which has three sub levels), a boss must be faced.</desc>

		<desc>James Pond, also known as James Pond: Underwater Agent, is a platform video game that was developed by British video game developers Vectordean Ltd and Millennium Interactive, and published by Millennium Interactive and Electronic Arts for numerous home computers and consoles in 1990. The character was popular and even featured in some comic books of the time, and the game was successful enough to spawn two sequels and one spin-off game.

A nefarious supervillain named "Doctor Maybe" (a pun on the name of Dr Julius No, the villain in Dr. No) has overtaken the ruthless megacorporation Acme Oil Co, and is not only filling the oceans with radiation and toxic waste but even threatening all the world from his underwater lair. The protagonist of the story and player character of the game is an intelligent, mutated anthropomorphic mudskipper who is given the name "James Pond" (after the legendary spy James Bond) and hired by the British Secret Service to protect the seas and take out the bad guys in underwater areas. He is also suave enough to seduce numerous attractive mermaids, some of whom act as double agents as is common with James Bond's love interests. The game spoofs James Bond movies with levels mimicking their titles, with level names like "License to Bubble" (after Licence to Kill), "A View to a Spill" (after A View to a Kill), "Leak and Let Die" (after Live and Let Die) and "From Three Mile Island with Love" (after From Russia with Love).</desc>

Jim Power is a side-scrolling platform game, a side-scrolling shooter and a top-view shooter game depending on the level. Jim Power for the most part can jump and has an upgradable gun weapon. He must find fight enemies, bosses and obtain various keys to progress through the levels. Jim also has a "Smart Bomb" power attack which can clear the screen of enemies. In shooter levels, Jim's spaceship only has the ability to shoot and move around the screen avoiding obstacles.</desc>

		<desc>Jimmy White's 'Whirlwind' Snooker is a computer game by veteran programmer Archer MacLean, released by Virgin Games in 1991 for the Commodore Amiga.

'Whirlwind' Snooker is a highly realistic snooker simulator. Although the game was not the first to simulate snooker (or pool) in 3D, it made full use of the processing power and graphics capabilities of 16-bit home computers and was praised for its then ground-breaking realism and easy-to-use interface. Many remarked that the game was the closest thing to being on a real snooker table which existed at the time, and it could be used by a player to refine real-life snooker skills.

Despite being an accurate and serious simulation of the sport, MacLean's irreverent sense of humour was prominent throughout. The sound effect used for a successful pot was a resounding "pop" and numerous animations provided comic relief should a player take more than a few seconds to shoot. Balls would sprout eyeballs and arms, making faces at the player or holding up signs that read "Get on with it!" and such.

The game was followed by Archer MacLean's Pool in 1992 and Jimmy White's 2: Cueball in 1999.</desc>

		<desc>Aquatania has recently become the land of misfortunes, due to a group of plotting witches. The task of finding five charms and a magic bracelet to put things right falls on you.

And you need a change of luck, because events in this game often emphasise the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. You get hit by a car, fall a great height, sprayed with cheese sandwich and more! Being the guinea pig in this strange world will drive you insane - if this jinxed land doesn't do it first. 

Jinxter is an interactive fiction with graphics title that takes a realistic world of people and situations, and then plays with the boundaries to create a strange and puzzling world. Characters are all getting on with their own tasks, and getting them to help you is usually a case of making sure something's in it for them.

Dialogue aims to add a comic touch to proceedings. Puzzles can often be solved in multiple ways, but the most obvious way is not always the correct one. Due to the presence of a Guardian, you can't actually die.</desc>

		<desc>Jocky Wilson's Darts Challenge is a darts game endorsed by the 1989 world champion. 

The game options are a 16-player tournament featuring up to four human players, a head to head game for two players, and single-player 'round the clock' (hitting the numbers 1 to 20 consecutively against a time limit).

During gameplay, the whole of the board is seen. The dart cursor swirls around the screen, can be controlled in a limited fashion and is released by pressing fire.</desc>

		<desc>John Lowe won the World Darts Championship twice, and puts his name to this combination of darts-based games. There are 10 difficulty levels to take on. Only part of the board is on screen at a time, with the screen scrolling as you move the arrow from your perspective. This makes some targets much harder to hit than others.

A practice mode is included, alongside standard 501 and round-the-board games, plus variants loosely based around soccer and cricket. In the former, the player who scores higher with each set of 3 darts gains territory (so in reality it&#x2019;s more like US Football). The cricket variant sees players alternate in batting and bowling roles &#x2013; in the former points are converted to runs; in the latter, hit the bullseye to get batsmen out.</desc>

		<desc>Death, pestilence, famine and other nasty things have stricken the once fair lands and it seems that only Asterix the wizard can save the populace from complete despair. Only problem is, Asterix opted out of the rat race some time ago. He now lives along atop a mountain and he is none too keen to receive visitors, so the first task in this keyword-driven adventure is to guide a party of (up to five) characters to Asterix and ask his help.

The screen is divided into three main sections: the top left is given over to small pictures of the various locations, the top right is where the text messages and general location descriptions appear and the bottom part of the screen is where you select various keywords that advance the adventure. The keywords offered for selection depend on the characters in the party, their current situation and the location. So playing the game is very easy and consists of simply reading the messages and deciding which actions to take.

Once you have found your way to Asterix's abode, the adventure really starts. The quest involves searching through the kingdoms of Dwarves, Elves, Nymphs and other creatures both fair and foul for seven sacred amulets that will enable the wizard to fight the Dread Lord. Progress is generally rapid if a little common sense is applied, but if you are completely stuck the musings' option at the end of the game hints at actions that you should have taken.

Altogether, Journey is good fun. The keyword system is simple and easy to use and the puzzles are all very logical and intriguing. It obviously won't appeal to hardened shoot-em-up fans, but anyone who likes games that require thought input will be rewarded with many hours of enjoyment.</desc>

		<desc>Some time after Operation Desert Strike, Ibn Kilbaba, son of Kilbaba S.R, threatens to annihilate America. After his father was killed, the people who were under his control, sent his son running off, along with his father's money and nuclear weapons program. Kilbaba, more ruthless than his father, longs for revenge of his father's death and decides to shed the blood of those who killed him, the Americans. Already armed, Kilbaba hires Carlos Ortega to help him set up his Nuclear Weapons program, deep in South America. Carlos Ortega, the world's most notorious druglord, also yearns to seek revenge. With his own private army, armed with the most hi-tech weapons, he's ready to fight America at all costs. 

Because of this threat, you're hired again to battle these two characters, following their paths in the jungles of South America. Armed with the Commache, numerous other vehicles, and destructive weapons, you must take out their private army. Blow up the enemy with your hellfires, hydras, chain guns. Use the watercraft to launch mines at enemy ships. Pull off a drive-by on the enemy with guns on the side. Take out the evil duo and forever rid this threat.....in the jungle!</desc>

		<desc>Your mission in Jupiter Probe, the latest release from Microdeal is to fly above the surface of Jupiter sending back photographs. However, a hostile race of beings whose only desire is to destroy Earth is trying to stop you from discovering the dark secrets of Jupiter.

The mightiest powers on Earth have united and supplied three scout ships with which to scour the surface of Jupiter. These ships are equipped with twin laser cannons and a limited number of 'advanced features'. These advanced features are Ultrasonics, which cause a disturbance in the area around your ship, thus destroying all aliens in your vicinity, and Shields which protect your craft from enemy fire for a short period of time.

As you can probably tell from the above, this is yet another shoot em up game. In fact it is very much like many other games of this type. Vertical scrolling, nice bold graphics, neat soundtrack, lots of aliens and plenty of action. The many craters, mountains, rivers (on Jupiter!!!?) and ground bases are all well drawn and very colourful, however they appear to be very 'chunky'. The sound is, in most respects, excellent.

The game is very playable as it is just about the right difficulty level for most people, making it fairly hard but not impossibly so. Control is with either mouse, joystick or keyboard. Jupiter Probe is a good value for money game, the price being something which I hope to see more often from both Microdeal and other software companies.</desc>

		<desc>Jupiter and its moons are colonized, and are an ideal setting for motor racing. 3 lap races featuring 3 cars each take place, viewed from above. Weapons which can throw a car off course are commonplace, as are short cuts and speed-boosting pads (which do not always follow a conventional racing line). As well as the races, there are timed money-collecting bonus duels on enclosed circuits.

You are one of the competitors, either in single races or a full season. Money is won for results, and collected as it lies on track. This can be spent on improvements such as engine and armor upgrades, as well as more powerful races.</desc>

		<desc>A game based on the hit movie Jurassic Park.

The game starts just after the T-Rex pushes the visitor's van into it's pit. You play the role of Dr. Alan Grant, so you have to find Tim and Lex, take them to the Visitor's center and get everybody out of the island. But this time it won't be half as easy as it was on the movie.

The game is split in two missions, played in two different ways. The first mission is to take Tim and Lex back to their grandfather and is (almost exclusively) played from a top-down perspective. The second mission involves getting the power back on line and returning alive, so everybody can leave the island and is played like a FPS (First Person Shooter).</desc>

		<desc>A space-based resource management game, loosely a sequel to the earlier Utopia.

You start building your community on an asteroid, whose natural resources must be mined and put to use. You must use generators to power the mines and their auxilliary buildings such as storage facilities, which must be maintained. All of this costs money, but the mined resources can be sold or used.

Problems you face include pollution, collisions with other asteroids, worker discontent and alien unrest. Battles against the aliens indigenous to the area must be fought, making building and maintaining a space fleet a priority.</desc>

		<desc>A pair of inseparable friends - smart, short, yet brave Kajko and his buddy, big, bald, fat, strong &amp; gluttonous Kokosz - must face again the notorious Zb&amp;#243;jcerze (Rogueknights) and their evil plot set to conquer the peaceful village of Mirmi&amp;#322;owo. The early medieval setting and fantasy themes resemble "Asterix &amp; Obelix".

Kajko i Kokosz is a classic point &amp; click adventure game, based on a popular Polish comic book series featuring the same characters. You can switch between the two characters at will, and some actions have to be done with a specific character. The controls are pretty simple - to interact with the environment, you just have to click. You have a limited space in your inventory, but you can take an object from your inventory and drop it anywhere at any time. The game graphics feature original artwork created by the creator of the series, Janusz Christa, thus retaining the "look &amp; feel" of the comic books.</desc>

The Planet Katakis is a horrifying example. Scientists created Machines which became so sophisticated that they longer depended on man - So began a rule of tyranny. The Denarian people tried in vain to destroy the Machines with a mighty ballistic missile, but from the ashes of the nuclear fires the Machines rose up more powerful than ever.

Trapped in an underground stronghold, now the Katakisans only hope for freedom is the KS-H75 Eagle Fighter, an ultra refined space glider. Control the Eagle Fighter in this epic crusade against evil... and win freedom at last for Katakis.</desc>

		<desc>Kelly X is a space shoot 'em up played from a first person perspective. The player is a pilot working for the Peace Foundation (a future version of Greenpeace) whose task it is to search space for rogue nuke stations that illegally dump nuclear waste. The objective is simple: destroy the radioactive canisters and the stations as well as the guardian fighters that protect them.

The player controls his space craft in a 3D space with the use of either mouse or joystick. The craft moves forward automatically but the speed can be increased and decreased. Moving left and right causes it to rotate while moving up and down causes it to climb or dive. To take down enemies and waste dumps a simple laser gun is fired. Colliding with or getting shot by enemies lead to the craft's shield depleting and when it's all gone it's game over. A hyperspace function can be used to move to a random location but then the shield will decrease.</desc>

		<desc>The player assumes the role of a controller in a Terminal Radar Approach Control, giving instructions to aircraft so that they can safely land, as well as take off and enter their correct flight corridors. The purpose of the game is to manage the flights that are presented to the player without the flights being delayed or exiting/landing in the wrong location. The aircraft either come flying in on the screen and have preset exit or landing points or show up as wanting to take off with an exit point. It is the player's job to determine the route each aircraft flies and when they may land or take off.

The aircraft cannot be too close to each other, so the player needs to make sure that they are passing each other on different flight levels or with sufficient distance (three grid dots north/south or east/west) between them. When an aircraft is in danger of crashing or is exiting at the wrong location or altitude, the aircraft will inform the air traffic controller. Aircraft do not change course/altitude unless the player tells them to. Incoming aircraft not given clearance to land, however, will go into a holding pattern and wait until given clearance. When necessary, the player can also give holding instructions to aircraft, as long as their course takes them over a VOR tower which is used as the holding fix.

To start with, there are few flights at the same time, but at higher GS levels, there are many flights that need management at the same time. Also storms which the aircraft can not pass through show up and some aircraft have very little fuel and have to land fast or they will crash.</desc>

		<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top-down view and unlike other football games of that time, the ball was not glued to the feet of the players.

Playing Kick Off requires skills in ball control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress, you will need to adapt to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched, but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</desc>

The game now features full tournament modes (although the players on the teams are fictitious) and four different pitches (including an implementation of plastic pitches, whose uneven bounce cause controversy when several British clubs tried them in the 1980s).

Viewed top-down, the controls involve trapping the ball under your foot, giving you time to prepare passes. Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</desc>

Running with the ball is tricky at first, as it doesn't stick to your foot the way it did in contemporary football games. Complex moves such as overhead kicks, back-heels and long-range through-ball passes can be completed with practice.</desc>

		<desc>Kick Off was the first football game of its kind, having a top-down view and unlike other football games of that time, the ball was not glued to the feet of the players.

Playing Kick Off requires skills in ball control. There is an option to learn these skills without being harassed by the opposition. The set pieces like corner kicks, passing, sliding tackles and dribbling can be practiced to perfection. Each player on the pitch has a unique combination of 4 attributes, namely Pace, Stamina, Accuracy and Aggression. As you progress, you will need to adapt to different types of players. You can play in a league consisting of 8 teams. The teams in the league are on the whole evenly matched, but have different styles of play with players attribute to match that style. There is 12 different referees in the game.</desc>

		<desc>Although not released for 8-bit systems, this platform game has a definite Commodore 64 feel to it. Bright primary colours and smiling characters are used to tell the tale of Kid's journey to rescue his girlfriend.

The levels feature an assortment of enemies to kill, including snakes, elves and crocodiles, as well as flames and spinning wheels. Many of these appear during the level, forcing you to plan for them. You have 10 lives, but the loss of one resets the level to its original state. The initial coin-throwing is pretty weedy, but better weapons (as well as extra lives and smart bombs) can be bought in the shop, which appears every 5 screens.

The levels are flick-screen, and can usually be finished in different ways, which results in different starting positions on the next screen, and you can travel back and forth through them, for example to pick up bonuses which are visible but not accessible as the level starts.</desc>

		<desc>A platform game resembling Mario and Wonderboy quite strongly. Kid must rescue the woman he loves by crossing 6 worlds, each split into 4 levels. There are a range of baddies to beat, following pre-set attack patterns or just staying on the spot, to be killed using your sword.

Once killed most release things like tokens, keys (sometimes required to open end-of-level doors), apples (for extra energy) and occasionally poison. There are lots of semi-hidden sections and bonus areas to find and explore, including bonus arcade games and fruit machines. Every world ends with a boss.</desc>

		<desc>Kikstart 2 is a motorcycle trials racing videogame released for the Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum. It enjoyed more success than its predecessor, Kikstart. The game allowed 2-player simultaneous (via a split-screen facility) or 1-player, vs-computer play. The game mechanics were copied into other games too, like the Game Boy game "Motocross Maniacs".

The basic premise of the game is to control a bike using acceleration, braking, "hopping" and "wheelies" to navigate across a course of various obstacles, from ramps and gates to telephone boxes and tyres.

The game was based on the BBC Television series Kick Start. An enhanced version was released for the Commodore 128,[1] one of the few native mode game titles for that computer.

This hovers around the middle of the skyscrapers, creating a claustrophobic low level experience (and a different feel to the many other flight simulations set in the city, such as F/A-18 Interceptor). 

In this maelstrom, the Black Angel gang is terrorising the public. The player is a member of the SFPD Police force, charged with bringing them down throughout ten missions. Some are out-and-out action while others are more strategic. You can only survive for 20 minutes in the smog, so time is crucial in these missions.

In addition to outflying the enemy on your hoverbike, the player must carefully pre-position ground forces to arrest him when he is brought down, using Pick-Up Pods. Once arrested, a suspect must be interrogated to release enough information to know what the next threat is.</desc>

		<desc>The Killing Game Show is a run and gun shooter game developed by Raising Hell Software for the Amiga and Atari ST. It was released in 1990 and published by Psygnosis. It was re-released later under the name Fatal Rewind for the Sega Genesis and published by Electronic Arts. The music and sound effects for the game were created by Ray Norrish. The main character of the game later made cameos in Leander and Wiz 'n' Liz.

This game is a mixture between platformer and shoot'em up. It looks very similar to the popular computer video game Turrican. Apart from avoiding or shooting enemies moving in different patterns you must make your way from the bottom up to the level exit because after a few seconds toxic liquid will start to rise. At the beginning of each level you may display a map by pressing the Help key (Amiga version). You can jump, run, climb walls and use special weapons or items (keys to open certain gates) to master different sections of these levels. After you lose one life you see a replay and be able to continue at any point by pushing the fire button. You can fast-forward the replay by holding the F10 key. This was a unique and convenient feature because like other Psygnosis titles the game has a high degree of difficulty.

The Amiga and Atari ST versions consisted of 8 levels separated into two parts each. The Genesis version was published as Fatal Rewind and had 6 levels divided into two parts each.</desc>

		<desc>You have survived a battle in space but your craft is damaged beyond repair and needs evacuating, so in your emergency landing craft you head for the nearest planet. The planet you are heading for is uninhabitable after a giant brain that controlled all life became extinct, but as you approach the surface it becomes clear that this isn't true as you are attacked by various life-forms.

Killing Machine is a top down vertically scrolling shooter where the screen scrolls upwards constantly as you attempt to shoot or avoid various aliens and vehicles over three levels. Getting touched or shot loses you one of three lives and sent to the start of the level you are playing. Certain objects when shot leave behind a power-up which gives you better weapons or a shield which is limited and if you lose a life then you lose your power-up. At the end of level one or two you face a huge Brain Guardian which needs destroying to move to the next level. At the end of the third level is the Giant Brain itself.</desc>

		<desc>The King of Chicago is a 1986 action adventure strategy computer game by Doug Sharp. Based on numerous Hollywood mobster movies, this game is set in the 1930s.

With Al Capone out of the picture, Chicago's prohibition-era profit is up for grabs. Are you merciless and cunning enough to gain it by whatever means are required? Every action you take has complex long-term consequences which are not always obvious at the time.

You must keep your people on your side, watching what you say and do, knowing that an overthrow could be hatched at any moment. Look after your woman as well - who's going to respect a single mobster? The money has to be juggled in these ways, not forgetting to reach an 'understanding' with the Mayor to avoid any negative attentions.</desc>

		<desc>As a knight, paladin, barbarian or sorceress, amass an army of creatures to take on the local baddies and search for the Sceptre of Order. A turn based game with a time limit that decreases depending on the skill level you play at.

Depending on your allegiance, you will initially start with a different set of creatures, though the king will not mind whether you're his knight or barbarian. Game consists of four maps, each with more mean creatures to control and meaner opponents to fight, but acquiring those maps early will let you find and buy some mean creatures that will help you easily conquer prior maps.

You can see all the enemies on the map and can literally clear the map of enemies, though random can appear in your castles if you leave them unprotected after the conquest. With each conquered castle (assuming the castle is occupied by the enemy you are currently after), you will get a level up, after first two level-ups king will promote you and you'll be able to recruit cavalries from the castle, after four more promotions you'll be able to recruit knights. All the other creatures are found outside the king's castle and can be recruited no matter the level, although your level determines the quantity of creatures you can find for recruitment, but take care of your money because if you don't have enough for your army's salary, they will desert or turn against you.

There are also two artifacts per each map that will also uncover the map of the place holding the King's Sceptre. The moment you find the sceptre and bring it back to the king, the game will end even if you happen to find it very early in the game.

As for tougher enemies, like the final one having hundreds of dragons and demons, they can also be defeated, but not by the army you can muster in one go. But when you're defeated, you respawn back at the king's castle and start with almost nothing but your money, however, the enemy in the castle will be left without those creatures lost in the battle, unless some of the new comes to aid him as every week the population increases.</desc>

		<desc>After having recovered the three treasures, King Graham has been crowned king. Now having needing a queen for companionship, Graham searches the land for a maiden, but to no avail, so he turns to the magic mirror for help. The mirror shows him a beautiful girl locked away in a quartz tower in a faraway land of Kolyma, and must find three keys that are used to unlock the door that will lead to her. 

King's Quest II: Romancing the Throne is a graphic adventure game. As is typical for Sierra's AGI games, players move Graham around with arrow keys and perform actions by typing commands in the interface, which are usually combination of verbs and nouns. The game is similar to its predecessor in structure and gameplay system. Like Daventry, Kolyma is a large cyclical world consisting of interconnected screens. Compared to the first game, it is bigger and busier, with more locations and places of interest. Puzzles follow a similar format; knowledge of fairy tales is advisable for solving some of them, and complex solutions grant the player more points than a brute force approach possible in some cases.</desc>

		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice had two children, Alexander and Rosella, and the kingdom was once peaceful. It wasn't long until Alexander was snatched from his crib and things started to take a turn for the worse. A three-headed dragon threatens the ever-peaceful Daventry, and requires a maiden to be sacrificed every year. Rosella is the chosen one.



Meanwhile, in a secluded house atop a mountain in the land of Llewdor, the evil wizard called Manannan keeps a young lad named Gwydion as his slave, forcing him to do menial tasks as he prepares his spells and observes the country through his telescope. Gwydion must find a way to outsmart the wizard, escape, and eventually discover the truth about his own identity.



King's Quest III: To Heir is Human is an adventure game similar in basic gameplay mechanics to its predecessor The player navigates Gwydion with arrow keys and interacts with the environment by typing verb and noun combination commands. Llewdor consists of interconnected screens that loop once the player character reaches the border of the land. Throughout the course of the game, Gwydion will also travel to other locations and have a magic map at his disposal, allowing him to teleport to different areas. 



There are more items to collect in this installment, and more complex actions required to execute, raising the difficulty level. A large part of the game proceeds in real time, with Mannanan following his own schedule, forcing the player to plan and time his actions. There is also a time limit imposed on the game's first major quest.</desc>

		<desc>King Graham and Queen Valanice were glad to have their children back. Graham thinks that it is time to pass onto them his old adventurers' hat. When he throws it across the room, he suffers a heart attack and collapses on the floor, and he is carried off to bed. The only way that Graham's health can be restored is by retrieving the magic fruit in the faraway land of Tamir. A beautiful fairy called Genesta offers Rosella the chance to be transported to the land, and find the fruit. But once she gets transported, she cannot be sent back unless she helps the fairy regain her talisman that was stolen by the evil witch, Lolotte. 

King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella is the first game in the series to have a female protagonist. Rosella will meet characters that will either help or hinder her. The player moves Rosella around with arrow keys, and have her perform actions by typing commands. Unlike the previous King's Quest games, which used the AGI engine, this installment uses the new SCI engine with more detailed graphics; the most visible effect is that the game is paused while the player is typing, giving unlimited time to complete even the longest commands. An AGI version of the game, however, was released as well.

Gameplay-wise, the game is similar to the first two installments of the series, with a large interconnected world open for exploration and no time limit imposed. The game is the first in the series to have a day and night cycle; certain actions can be performed only during a specific time.</desc>

		<desc>Dark powers summon a cold wind from the north. The terrifying gust surrounds Sir Graham's castle, and mysteriously sweeps his fortress and family into the prison of oblivion. It's a bitter omen that chills the bones of every man, woman and child in the once peaceful Kingdom of Daventry. Who or what is responsible for this royal theft, and the misery that ravages the heart of Daventry? Has the ruthless wizard Manannan cast another evil spell? Or are the Black Forest Witch and the unforgiving Ice Queen using sinister powers to promote their wicked cause? Only you can answer these questions, as you assume the role of Sir Graham, then set forth on an adventure that will test your intelligence, challenge your skill and rip your courage to shreds.</desc>

		<desc>On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle. When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared! Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears. He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it. Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides. Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.

King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface. Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands. To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag. By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area. Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at". The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects. The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too). Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors. Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag. By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has. In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.

As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die. Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise. The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.</desc>

		<desc>For months Prince Alexander of Daventry has shut himself away from the world, thinking only of Princess Cassima, who he met while imprisoned in the previous game. Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.

Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him. Alexander must be careful as well, because, as with all the King's Quest games, poor choices or missteps will often prove fatal for the Prince. Puzzles are solved linearly, although late in the game there are two completely different paths to take to reach the final confrontation. Like the previous game, actions are performed using a point-and-click interface with icons that represent verbs ("walk", "examine", "use", "talk", etc.).</desc>

		<desc>In Knight Force, the land Belloth, crossroad between five time periods, was conquered by the evil wizard Red Sabbath. And if that is not enough, he also kidnapped the princess. The player takes the role of a knight who has to set things right.

To do so, he needs to complete five levels which represent different time periods. The goal is not only to destroy the wizard clone which occupies the time period, but also to collect seven talismans which are in possession of the wizard's minions. Each collected talisman brings advantages to the hero but only work in the correct time period which may not correspond with the one it is found in. To put them to best use, the player can always pull out of a level and choose another. The challenges are platforming and melee sword-fights against various enemies. The player can perform eight combat moves.</desc>

		<desc>Knight Orc is a standard text adventure game, with limited graphics on some platforms, by Level 9 released in 1987. It comes with a short novella by Peter McBride ("The Sign of the Orc") explaining the background to the story.

After a night of heavy drinking with friends, Grindleguts the orc awakes to find himself strapped to a horse and about to joust with a human knight. His "friends" are nowhere to be seen, and he must somehow escape from his predicament and get even with them. Grindleguts must survive in a world of hostile humans while seeking revenge against his tormentors.

After the first chapter, the game switches to science fiction setting where Grindleguts is revelaled to be a malfunctioning non-player character in a futuristic MMORPG. Using his power of transitioning between fantasy and reality, he convinces several other bots to join him, and escapes from the simulated reality facility.</desc>

The Tsirit involves navigating maze-like monster-infested pathways, armed with plasma bolts and a protective suit. Within this you will encounter Bosu, a marble-based game played on a board. The Proda involves placing matching pairs of crystals in such a way that they will be charged by beams of light. 

All the while, you must play the Haresh section, to keep your family under control. This involves financial trading; getting a fair price for the goods you produce, and buying the right amounts of food, clothes and other essentials. Money must also be donated to the Tsirit.</desc>

		<desc>Dizzy must rescue four of his 'Yolkfolk' (groan) chums in this game, from Cuckoo Land, Ice Land, Cloud Land and Zak's Castle.  Like Fast Food it doesn't directly resemble the main series of arcade adventures, instead being a single-screen action game, resembling Pengo. The basic idea is to move around a maze of blocks collecting fruit, but the twist in the style is that you push the blocks in the maze to kill or trap those enemies. After every level is completed a short bonus screen appears where more fruit can be collected. During play various other tokens are released, such as bonus points, a smart bomb and control reversal.

		<desc>Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 racetracks across America. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.

The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.

When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.

Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back.</desc>

		<desc>Laser Squad is a turn-based tactics war game where the player completes objectives such as rescue or retrieval operations, or simply eliminating all of the enemy by taking advantage of cover, squad level military tactics, and careful use of weaponry. The squad's team members are maneuvering around a map one at a time, taking actions such as move, turn, shoot, pick up and so on that use up the unit's action points. More heavily laden units may tire more easily, and may have to rest to avoid running out of action points more quickly in subsequent turns. Morale also plays a factor; a unit witnessing the deaths of his teammates can panic and run out of the player's control.</desc>

		<desc>Taking place in the year 2012 of an alternate galaxy, Last Duel involves the struggle between two planets Mu and Bacula. On planet Bacula, a strong warrior tribe known as the Galden rose to immense military power and literally conquered all of the societies on the planet. Unsatisfied with conquering just one planet, the Galden decided to conquer a neighboring terrestrial planet, Mu. Using advanced bioships, star fighters and motor vehicles, the Galden invaded Mu, destroying many of its cities and taking the planet's ruler Queen Sheeta hostage.

The remaining royal guards of Mu are deployed in space fighters that can transform into cars to rescue the queen and crush the Galden forces.</desc>

		<desc>With the scrolls now in his possession, The Last Ninja begins training a new order of Ninja. During a training session he is mysteriously transported to XXth-century New York. The Evil Shogun has returned! Torn from his own time, The Last Ninja must defend himself once more with nothing more than the belief in his own abilities.

Last Ninja 2: Back with a Vengeance is an action/adventure game where the player, controlling a powerful ninja, must fight his way through opponents while collecting necessary items. The game is split into various levels, each of them depicting a different locale and divided into several screens. The view is isometric and the ninja can move in four different dimensions (he can also walk backwards) and jump.

Enemies, armed with fists and various ninja weapons, wander around the levels. The ninja must fight them either bare-handed or with the weaponry he finds along the way; in either case, he has a number of blows and attacks at his disposal, as well as the ability to block. There's a special weapon, shuriken, which are thrown in a straight line rather than used for melee combat; if they strike an enemy, they'll instantly kill or at least heavily damage him.

There are items scattered around the levels, such as keys, rope, a map or hamburgers (which restore health when eaten). Collecting these items and using them in a proper place is necessary for completing the game.</desc>

		<desc>Something that has always amazed me is why golf is such a popular computer conversion. The games do not feature any sequences of nail biting action, and yet on the Commodore 64, Leader Board was the top selling game in 1986. As the Amiga market is following closely in the footsteps of the 64, it is not surprising that three of the first sports conversions are golf games, although they do vary wildly in quality.

Leader Board can only really be described as an arcade golf game. It takes the basic ideas behind golf, simplifies them, and turns the game into one that depends as much on dexterity as it does on tactics.

Once loaded, Leader Board gives you the choice of how many players will take part &#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153; between one and four &#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153; what course you want to play on &#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153; from the four provided &#xC3;&#xA2;&#xE2;&#x201A;&#xAC;&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153; and what level you want to play at. Provided with the minimalist British packaging, it is a comprehensive guide to both the game and the four courses, and on the Amateur level (where the ball is not affected by book, swing or wing), it is possible for even a total beginner to get round the courses without too many mistakes.

For anyone who has never played golf before, Leader Board provides an excellent introduction. It is one of the most playable sports simulations yet, and even my golf-mad dad found the game simple enough to spend a few quiet hours fiddling with the mouse. In comparison with most games on the Amiga, the graphics are not spectacular, but they are good enough to reflect all the action, and that is the most important. The sound too is uninspiring, but surprisingly the lack of audio-visual stimulation is not seen to detract too much from the game's overall enjoyment level.</desc>

		<desc>Leading Lap MPV is a three dimensional racing game with filled polygon graphics that can be played from a first person perspective or multiple third person perspectives. The game features a season mode as well as grudge matches that are multiplayer games played against a friend over a serial null modem connection.

Upon starting a new season the player first gets to choose a driver. There are five different ones and each has different statistics in terms of top speed, handling and braking. After that the player also gets to choose one of three vehicles (formula one, rally or endurance car). These differ in terms of top speed, braking and acceleration. When all choices have been made it's possible to jump straight into the first race of the championship or to practice on any of the game's race tracks. The game has a total of twelve tracks and these are played through in order. Each race is played against four AI drivers and points are awarded based on positions. To win the championship the player simply has to earn more points than the competitors.</desc>

		<desc>Hailed as a Formula One Grand Prix beater by new kids on the block, Kellton,  Leading Lap very nearly give the claim validity. But not quite.

Before we discuss why, let's look at what makes Leading Lap a creditable pretender to the crown. It's got a tremendous multiview 3D polygon based engine driving it and the frame rate is fast enough to ensure a smooth, believable motor racing environment. It makes use of extra memory, faster processors and FPUs with the handling of the various cars is such that if you drive too fast on a long bend the car spins out due to excessive speed - incredibly realistic for a game which is more arcade based than simulation. Finally, the driving has a reasonably good feel to it (or a hybrid between an arcade game and a simulation)

And then there's the but. An unfortunate but, but a 'but' nevertheless. There aren't enough competitors taking part in the race - four in all. To maintain a credible sense of conflict throughout a full race, there should always be someone to press for a place, or someone pressing for a place on you. That doesn't happen with Leading Lap. Still, it's fun in a limited kind of a way to reach the giddy heights of being the winner all the time. With twelve tracks to race on it's going to take you a reasonable stretch of extended play before approaching anything like full competency.

In all, a competent, enjoyable romp. Not quite up with F1 for immediacy and out and out pace, but still good enough to convince enough people to part with their cash for a few hours of solid entertainment. If you've got an Amiga friend, try out the serial link option; it's not bad.</desc>

		<desc>Hailed as a Formula One Grand Prix beater by new kids on the block, Kellton,  Leading Lap very nearly give the claim validity. But not quite.

Before we discuss why, let's look at what makes Leading Lap a creditable pretender to the crown. It's got a tremendous multiview 3D polygon based engine driving it and the frame rate is fast enough to ensure a smooth, believable motor racing environment. It makes use of extra memory, faster processors and FPUs with the handling of the various cars is such that if you drive too fast on a long bend the car spins out due to excessive speed - incredibly realistic for a game which is more arcade based than simulation. Finally, the driving has a reasonably good feel to it (or a hybrid between an arcade game and a simulation)

And then there's the but. An unfortunate but, but a 'but' nevertheless. There aren't enough competitors taking part in the race - four in all. To maintain a credible sense of conflict throughout a full race, there should always be someone to press for a place, or someone pressing for a place on you. That doesn't happen with Leading Lap. Still, it's fun in a limited kind of a way to reach the giddy heights of being the winner all the time. With twelve tracks to race on it's going to take you a reasonable stretch of extended play before approaching anything like full competency.

In all, a competent, enjoyable romp. Not quite up with F1 for immediacy and out and out pace, but still good enough to convince enough people to part with their cash for a few hours of solid entertainment. If you've got an Amiga friend, try out the serial link option; it's not bad.</desc>

		<desc>A squad of four tough-guy soldiers have to take out some foes in a jungle. As the game starts, four soldiers are depicted, with any who are not present to play killed immediately - a joystick adaptor is required for 3 or 4 player games.

Leatherneck resembles Ikari Warriors - waves of soldiers move down the screen shooting at you, and you must shoot them before the bullets make contact. You are armed with grenades to take out mounted turrets, or kill a wide range of enemies at once, but watch out for enemy grenades. There are extra ammunition crates and improved weapons to pick up - waggle the joystick to toggle which one you are using.

Unusually, your shots are long-range and take effect instantly. You cannot change the direction you are facing, instead having the ability to strafe.</desc>

		<desc>In Leavin' Teramis the titular space ship gets conquered by aliens. The whole crew has managed to flee - except Nigel MacGibbons who slept through the evacuation due to his nightly drinking activities. Now he needs to reach the last escape pod by finding his way through ten levels, all with a big boss at the end.

From an overhead perspective, the player controls MacGibbons through the corridors and rooms of the ship, scrolling in multiple directions. Despite controlling a human instead of a ship, the game is a straight shooter: using a gun to kill everything that moves while dodging enemy attacks and bullets. Getting hit reduces the energy bar and when it reaches zero, a life is lost. Special symbols give advantages when picked up, like extra time on the time limit, extra lives or weapon upgrades.</desc>

		<desc>The Legend of Kyrandia is the first in a trilogy of adventure games by Westwood. In this game the player controls Brandon, grandson of Kallak - a wizard of the realm of Kyrandia. Malcolm, a psychotic jester imprisoned in the past by Kallak, has broken free and wishes to take over the land as well as lay down his revenge. He turns Kallak into stone leaving him with only his eyes, so that Kallak is not denied his tears for Kyrandia's sake.

This is where Brandon steps in; returning home shortly afterwards only to find that his grandfather has been turned into stone, Brandon is being told by a messenger from the Realm of the Land that he has been chosen to embark on a journey that will rid this realm of Malcolm and his evil. He has to prove himself not only a hero, but a worthy heir to the crown and ultimately of becoming a king.

Throughout the journey Brandon will collect many items and also learn how to master magic. Available spells include disappearing, healing yourself, summoning ice upon fire and shifting into a wisp. Interaction with the environment is confined to highlighted items, and a single cursor is used for all actions, without differentiating precise commands.</desc>

		<desc>A version of an old Norse board game called King's Table. The game has black and white teams, like chess, but each team has different pieces and a different raison d'etre.

The white team has a total of 13 pieces, the most important one being Odin the King, who starts in the centre of the 10x10 board and moves in the same way as a chess King, whereas black has 20 pawns and four other pieces. White wins if Odin can reach one of the corner squares; black wins if it surrounds Odin on all 4 sides. The pawns actually move the same way as chess queens, but pieces are captured by surrounding them on 2 sides (although some special pieces must be surrounded on 3 sides). The specials are chosen from the selection at the start of the game, and have a variety of abilities, some 'borrowed' from chess.

The presentation of this interpretation is similar to Battle Chess, with bold 3D graphics and lots of animation.</desc>

		<desc>Legend of the Lost has seven levels in total, with you controlling Jack in his attempt to rescue Jane.

The intention of Legend Of The Lost is to recreate the old B-movies of the 30s. However, thanks to some dull presentation and a batch of dull sub-games, it just doesn't hold together. Graphically, the game is unimpressive, with small sprites and basic animation, and the overall impression given is one of an 8-bit game. Very average graphics. The sprite detection seems to be a bit iffy on the first level, and the game really slows down in the fifth. A tune plays while you make you way through the game, but although it's not too bad it really starts to get on your nerves after a while.

It has all the makings of a good game, but unfortunately it doesn't manage to addict you in the slightest. Each of the game's seven levels just fail to grab your attention and the only reason you continue to play, is that it is really easy and you can tell that you will probably beat it in the first day. The cartoon strip is a nice idea, but is to slow and the humor is very poor. Unfortunately, Legend of the Lost is hardly the stuff Amigas were made for.</desc>

		<desc>The game tells of the chronicles of Anar and the mystical sword and shield whose magical aura protected the inhabitants of Anar for many centuries. Time Past these items into folklore history along with the Corsarians who supposedly guarded them. Anar has now been invaded by hordes of humanoids under the control of Suxar, and rumour tells that only with the combined force of the Sword and Shield will it be possible to defeat the invaders. You and a band of loyal men volunteer to find the enchanted artifacts and take on Suxar before time runs out.

What makes Legend any different than any other adventure then? Quite simply how the game unfolds. The way the story comes to life, as you move along the map is almost akin to reading a book, and when you are asked to make a decision, invariably the words you choose will be understood. The map can be expanded to take up the whole screen if you wish, and some of the pictograms are very realistic. There are bags of humour, and a very real need to communicate effectively with the other members of your party, although when there is fighting to be done it is left to you to get on with it.

The box contains a novelette, which does contain some clues, and a poster, but what won me over in this game is Legend Of The Sword's sheer playability. It's so user friendly, and there is even a help command which kicks in without you asking it to. Go get Legend Of The Sword right now and start having a ball.</desc>

		<desc>The opening sequence of the game finds Larry mowing the lawn of Eve, his sexual encounter from the ending of the previous game, implying the pair have remained together. However, this is quickly revealed to be an instance of an unreliable narrator, as Eve pulls into the driveway with only the vaguest recollection of who Larry is. Realising that his affair with Eve was merely a one-night stand, a distraught Larry wanders off, winning a free vacation after stumbling into a rigged game show. During his preparations for the cruise ship, a microfilm falls into Larry's hands by mistake; this attracts the attention of the KGB as well as the mad scientist Dr. Nonookee (a pun on "no nookie"), who both want to recover the film.



Sierra On-Line intentionally toned down the titular character's sexual escapades for the sequel.[2] According to series creator Al Lowe, this lack of Leisure Suit Larry's trademark humor is an oft-cited criticism of the game.[2] Throughout the adventure there are recurring themes that contribute to the comedic effect, like visitation to identical barber shops in almost each location Larry visits; one of them is tended by Rosella of King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella.</desc>

		<desc>Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work! is (despite the number) the fourth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?

Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Use" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to "die" in Larry 5, and the amount of "dead ends" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases.

		<desc>Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work! is (despite the number) the fourth game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series. The middle-aged would-be-womanizer Larry Laffer fell off a boat during a cruise and sustained amnesia, forgetting how he and his sweetheart Patti got separated, how Larry got a job in LA, how Patti got a job with the FBI, and what happened in (the never released) Larry 4. Now Larry and Patti are working independently on two cases that are connected to each other, even though the heroes aren't aware of that. Larry's new bosses are involved in shady business, while Patti agrees to take a break from her career as a performing pianist and become an undercover agent. Will the two be together ever again?

Unlike the previous games with their text input, Larry 5 utilizes a graphical, icon-based interface. The player uses verb commands ("Look", "Talk", "Use" etc.) to interact with the environment. In a way not quite typical for Sierra's adventure games, it is impossible to "die" in Larry 5, and the amount of "dead ends" (unwinnable situations) is greatly reduced. The game is also less puzzle-oriented, allowing the player to proceed even if he/she fails to solve the required puzzle in some cases. However, the player is awarded more points for finding the "right" solution. As in the third game, both Larry and Patti are available as playable characters during different chapters of the story.</desc>

		<desc>Back in 1987, Leisure Suit Larry, a humorous graphic adventure, arrived on Amiga screens. In 1991, Sierra decided to revive the old classic with enhanced graphics and sound, while sprucing up the gameplay with their (then) new icon based user interface. The Man in Polyester was back, looking and sounding better than before. But is the new version a worthy successor to the old classic?

Simple answer is - yes and no. The enhanced graphics meant 256 colours in the IBM compatible world - on the Amiga side this meant 32 colour dithered graphics with a rather shabby colour palette. Apparently the colour scheme was downgraded with no regards to picture quality. Luckily the animation is fluid. Speaking of graphics, the biggest difference between the original and this enhanced version is in the main character graphics. Larry has been transformed from a 'lego man' to 'Mr big giant potato head', resembling his picture on the gamebox cover much more than before. Soundwise the game is really enhanced - there's now properly orchestrated four channel music and also some speech samples which are put to good use.

The biggest change in the new version is without doubt the new user interface. When designing their own icon-based UI, Sierra chose a very different path than for example LucasArts. First, the selection of verbs is very limited - walk, look, action, talk - and second, they are chosen in a very straightforward manner, by either continuously clicking the right mouse button until the mouse cursor transforms into the required choice or by selecting them from the icon bar which appears at the top of the screen if you move the mouse cursor over it. The new system is very easy to learn and use.

While the original version has a special place in my heart and despite the slightly flawed conversion I would recommend this new version over it. The actual gameplay has not changed at all - all the toilet humour and shabby scenes (complete with the animated 'CENSORED' plate) are still there. If you own the original version there's no reason to buy this unless you are stuck in the original and want to play the game with the new easier user interface. Also, if you hate the game style Larry represents, this game is unlikely to turn you into a convert.</desc>

		<desc>Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards is the first game in Al Lowe's Leisure Suit Larry series, largely inspired by the text adventure Softporn Adventure.

Larry, the game's protagonist, is a short, tacky, balding, leisure suit-wearing kinda guy who's constantly searching for his next score. His combination of stupidity and brashness gets Larry into trouble. The object is to get him out of trouble in traditional adventure fashion, finding and manipulating objects as you thread your way through the story line. The content is comedic and adult-oriented. A graphical interface is used with a text parser to input commands. Typical of Sierra games, progress is tracked through a set amount of points, awarded for advancement or minor actions.</desc>

		<desc>The basic objective of the game is to guide a group of humanoid lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.

Lemmings was one of the best received video games of the early 1990s era. The popularity of the game led to development of its numerous ports to other systems and the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, as well as inspiring similar games.

		<desc>Your task is to rescue the Lemmings across 120 levels of fast-paced puzzling. These creatures simply walk blindly through the world in the hope of reaching safety at the end of the level - unfortunately these levels include steep drops, gaps in the ground, barriers and rivers amongst other hazards.

You are in control not of any individual Lemming, but of a cross-hair, which can be moved over any of the Lemmings. Along the bottom are a selection of functions which can be assigned to a Lemming, including climbing, floating and bashing. You must click to select the appropriate function, then click on the Lemming to activate it. Each level has a different range of skills on offer, a different amount of Lemmings, and a different percentage target in order to progress.</desc>

		<desc>Lemmings 2: The Tribes is a puzzle video game released in 1993, the sequel to Lemmings. As with the original, it was developed by DMA Design and published by Psygnosis. The gameplay remains mostly the same as the original game, requiring the player to lead a certain number of lemmings to their exit by giving them the appropriate "skills".

Once upon a time, the twelve lemming tribes of Lemming Island lived joyfully and peacefully. However, an ancient prophecy foretells a great darkness soon to cover the island. This prophecy tells that the only way the lemmings can live is by getting off their island, using the power of the Lemming Talisman. This talisman consists of twelve pieces, one owned by each tribe. With the help of the Guide that has helped them before (referring to the player in the previous Lemmings game), all lemmings must now reach the center point of their island in order to escape their doom.</desc>

Use your joystick to lead Leonardo through 50 different levels including banks, museums, and warehouses. Pressing the fire button of your joystick you can push everything in your way, except walls. Pushed objects won't stop until colliding with other objects or the police officer and his ghost deputy whom are trying to stop your robberies. Every level has a time limit in which you must bring three equal items into one line to complete the level. Each level is larger than the screen, in the lower half of the screen you have a helpful radar for orientation.

		<desc>Lethal Xcess is a shoot 'em up game developed by two members of demo crew X-Troll and published by Eclipse Software in 1991 for the Atari ST and Amiga. It is a sequel to 1990's Wings of Death, in which its wizard hero goes into far future to fight the descentants of the evil witch that he has conquered in the first game. Despite having been acclaimed by critics, the game was a commercial failure.</desc>

		<desc>Lethal Zone is a German horizontal shooter in the same vein as the R-Type series of games. You control a spaceship and you shoot enemy ships and obstacles, while avoiding projectiles and crashing on any surface. Holding the fire button and releasing it increases the power of your shots, while hitting it repeatedly lets out a stream of them. The destroyed enemies occasionally leave behind power-ups that can be collected. They increase and modify the power of your shots. You start with 5 lives, and at each 50.000 points you receive an extra one. The games has four levels, each with a unique "boss" enemy at the end.</desc>

		<desc>Leviathan takes place on isometric science-fiction landscapes where all enemies have to be destroyed. So the player mans a space ship, flies around the three levels (with the ability to turn around and change the flying height) and shoots everything he sees: Besides flying enemies there are also defense stations on the ground to be dealt with. But while rocket ammo is unlimited, fuel has to be regularly refilled by landing besides a fuel pod. Three smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen help in tight situations. Every level runs on a time limit.</desc>

		<desc>Life &amp; Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. 

To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. 

In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. 

Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong.

		<desc>The aim of the game is to guide a ball through 50 levels of walls, barriers and general obstacles. You control a bat, which must 'serve' the ball into play, and then follow it through the level, deflecting it before it falls behind you, as this costs you one of your 4 lives. Initially the obstacles are all static, but moving barriers add timing, reactions and luck to proceedings.

There are also several bonus objects, which are collected by passing through them. These include an L for an extra ball and dual rectangles to give you a second bat which moves around at random.

The game also comes with a full level editor, allowing you to design new levels and save them to tape or disk.</desc>

		<desc>Unusually, this Operation Wolf-influenced shoot 'em up sees you start behind enemy lines, and gradually attempting to escape. As you've captured the Rapier machine gun your enemy have been developing, there are plenty who can't bear to see the back of you unless it's bloodied and lifeless.

The game's 8 levels feature quite a variety of settings, vehicles and situations. You will have to evade fire from snipers based in windows, enemy jets, helicopters and well-trained marines, while riding tanks and speedboats as well as being on foot. The levels are set in locations such as the enemy camp, the jungle, a ruined city and the final flight back to your base.</desc>

		<desc>Young Simba just can't wait to be king. His father is the current King of the Savannah and the young prince is able to frolic the lands at will; jumping on and around other subjects of this animal kingdom. When Simba's father, King Mufasa, is killed and his evil brother Scar takes over the kingdom, Simba is banished from the lands of his birthright and has to grow up fast, honing his skills, for the day of his return.

The Lion King, based on the famous Disney movie, is a platform game where you control Simba - initially as a young cub, and later as an adult lion. The plot of the game follows the plot of the movie. Each of the levels represents a part of the movie. 

As young Simba, you can fight various beasts, such as lizards, by jumping on them. You can also roar to scare some creatures into submission, though every time you roar, you have to wait for your "roar meter" to charge. 

As an adult lion, you can still roar and jump, but now you fight enemies by slashing at them with your claws (if you're skillful enough, you can also grab them and toss them off the screen). 

The game features no in-game save function, and it needs to be replayed from the beginning every time.</desc>

		<desc>Little Computer People can be described as the "mother" of The Sims. When you load the game for the first time and personalise it with your name you'll see a house with several rooms like a kitchen, living room, bed room, etc. After some time of waiting a little person will appear and check out the house with all its rooms to see if he likes it. If he likes it, he will move in shortly and bring his dog along with him. 

That's where the real "game" starts and that's what it will be like every time you'll load the game from then. You see the house and the little person living in it, doing all kinds of stuff people do in their daily routine. He'll cook, eat, feed his dog, read newspapers, watch TV and from time to time he will write you a letter to let you know what he feels or what things he misses. To keep it more game-like, you can "talk" to him in form of typing commands like "feed dog". You can also play cards with him and send him food or a present. There is no aim in this game other than to interact with your LCP.</desc>

		<desc>Livingstone II is an excellent sequel to Livingstone I Presume, Opera Soft's classic side-scrolling 2D platformer. Adventure game fans will be glad to know that Opera Soft drops the action focus of the first game this time around, and return to the action/adventure mix.

The plot is negligible, but it does pick up where the first game left off. You play Dr. David Livingstone, legendary adventurer who was found by journalist Stanley at the end of the first game. Your job is to get out of Africa jungles alive, but before that, you must discover ancient treasure hidden in the ruins. Similar to the first game, Livingstone II allows you to change weapons in your arsenal at any time. The trusty whip and pole, which is used to vault across chasms, are back and more useful than ever. In addition to weapon slots, you also have inventory slots to store and use non-weapon objects you come across. While much of the game still requires reflexes to succeed, there is a considerable number of adventure-style puzzles to solve. In addition to hostile animals, you must deal with traps and other obstacles.

I feel that Livingstone II is easier than the first game, perhaps because most danger comes in the form of traps, which you just need good timing to avoid, rather than angry creatures that you must dispose of to save yourself. As in the first game, the maps in Livingstone II are large and intricate, full of hidden surprises and shortcuts. Overall, Livingstone II is a fun action/adventure platformer that action fans will enjoy -- and adventure game fans may be interested in as well.</desc>

		<desc>Llamatron is a fast-action arcade-style Shareware game guaranteed to have your FIRE button finger dangling off at the tendons! '90s ultraviolence in its very essence! Hours of fun for you (and a camel-friend if you like) blowing away horde after horde of alien fiends in the comfort of your own personal environment!

This game is based on an old Williams arcade game by the same dude who wrote Defender. The game - Robotron - was a big hit in the early Eighties. Llamatron takes the Robotron idea and distorts it in a Yakly fashion, adding loads of new stuff and plenty of furry beasties in the Llamasoft style.

You play the part of a totally hard laser-spitting llama. Your mission is to collect all the tiny sheep, llamas, camels and goats you see on each wave.  Standing in your way are great herds of unintelligent but numerous Grunt enemies, plus a veritable menagerie of nasty creeps which fire at you, dodge your fire, emit fire hydrants, try to ram you, murder your llamas and shoot your bottoms off with lasers. Kill them deadly.

Not everything can be killed, and some enemies take more than one shot to destroy. Your ultimate objective - destroy the Ozric Tentacle of level 99 and get to Herd Heaven on level 100.</desc>

Standing in your way are great herds of unintelligent but numerous Grunt enemies, plus a veritable menagerie of nasty creeps which fire at you, dodge your fire, emit fire hydrants, try to ram you, murder your llamas and shoot your bottoms off with lasers. Kill them deadly.

Not everything can be killed, and some enemies take more than one shot to destroy. Your ultimate objective - destroy the Ozric Tentacle of level 99 and get to Herd Heaven on level 100.</desc>

		<desc>Locomotion is an arcade-puzzle game in which you are presented with a top-down view of a railway network with a number of stations and junctions. Trains are released from stations at random intervals, each with a destination station. Your job is to get a set number of them to this destination within a time limit. 

You control a cursor which can click on each of the junctions, toggling their positions. When trains reach a junction which is not set in a direction they can move through, they will stop until you move it. When they reach the wrong station they simply reverse and continue. If two trains make contact, they are lost, and a penalty is accrued.</desc>

		<desc>Sweet she is and sweets she wants. Young Lolly wakes up and has an incredibly appetite for candy. For chocolate, and for caramel and gingerbread, and for cookies and crisps and marshmallows and lemonade and bubblegum and jelly bears and ice and cream and sugar frosted chocolate bombs. All right, we&#x2019;ve all had such moments. But Lolly is a doll. Animated by a stroke of lightning, she suddenly has life, a sweet tooth and a quest: Onward to the land where candy grows and the refrigerators never run out!

It&#x2019;s a hostile world for small, innocent and rather hungry little dolls &#x2013; that&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;ve got to help Lolly find her way through eight big levels in this jump&#x2019;n&#x2019;run game. After the escape from the toy factory, the way to the promised land leads through places like a ghost town, a snow world and even Lolly&#x2019;s own cottony dreams. The way is far from safe: plenty of traps and monsters threaten a doll&#x2019;s life, but good timing, athletic leaps and an ample supply of lollipops to fling at obtrusive enemies help mastering any challenge. In desperate situations, Lolly can take a snapshot with her pocket camera, which instantly destroys all opponents on the screen. Huge level bosses guard the exit of each world; defeating the mega-monsters requires specific tactics. 

Fortunately, there is support: chests contain key items (to unlock different parts of each level), power-ups and plenty of sweets, of course. On the downside, the boxes may also yield harmful objects that jumble up Lolly&#x2019;s controls or even hurt her. Tender dolls of that model can sustain three hits before they break apart. There&#x2019;s a time limit for each level, so sucking popsicles in a corner won&#x2019;t do. You cannot save the game, but you get a personal passcode after each level.</desc>

		<desc>Loom is an adventure game that sets itself apart from other titles in the genre through its unique gameplay system: the player character does not carry items around, but rather manipulates objects through the use of spells (called "drafts" in the game). The drafts themselves are woven by playing magical notes on a special instrument called "distaff". All the puzzles in the game are solved by learning and correctly applying these drafts.

Each draft is a sequence of four notes within one octave. The player learns new drafts by exploring the environment and interacting with it through a simple point-and-click interface. Once a draft has been learned, it may be applied in a different situation in order to solve a problem. Drafts range from simple general actions (such as opening) to more specific and complex commands, e.g. turning straw into gold. Drafts can also be "reversed", i.e. played backwards, in order to execute the opposite action (for example, closing something instead of opening). As the game progresses Bobbin learns to play higher notes on the distaff, allowing him to access more drafts.</desc>

		<desc>In the desert town Vertic, werewolves, vampires, mummies and zombies appear suddenly, feasting on the population until only a ghost town of undead is left. Two ordinary citizens team up with two professional monster hunters to cleanse the town of evil. Sharon, Charlie, Susan Leicester and Abraham Van Halen must fight their way through monsters and eventually defeat the overlord of each species, ending the invasion. 

Lords of Doom is a hybrid game that incorporates elements of adventure and role-playing. The player controls the party of characters from a first-person view, navigating a pseudo-3D town. The adventure gameplay manifests itself in exploration of individual locations, interaction with objects, and the use of items to solve puzzles. Role-playing elements are present in party management and character statistics. Each character has, beside hitpoints, thirst and hunger meters, so that the player has to "feed" the characters regularly in order for them to stay alive. Combat is done in real time.</desc>

		<desc>Lords of the Realm is a turn-based strategy game developed and published by Impressions Games in 1994. It was originally released for the Amiga and MS-DOS, but it was ported to Windows three years later.

In this strategy meets resource management game you play as a lord who is vying for the currently empty throne against other lords. The focus is on building up your empire and putting your serfs to work to make it glorious. This game allows you to either design your own castles or use a blueprint. The game requires some amount of micromanagement, but over time your serfs will be able to be efficient without as much intervention from you. Take care of your serfs and they will take care of you. You can also take part in land battles against your enemies to make them bow before you. During battle you can take control of a single unit or entire groups of your army. With access to several different unit types, you can pick the right ones for each battle. The game also gives you the option to let the computer auto-battle for you if you would rather focus on other things. Just for fun, you may also send your own messages to the opposing lords and call them nasty names. You must take over counties before the other lords beat you to it. Grow your empire, take out the other lords and claim that throne!

Lords of the Realm is seen as the ancestor to titles like the &#x201C;Total War&#x201D; series and is a piece of strategy history, snagging Best Strategical in 1995. Keep in mind that this game does not strive to be historically accurate. This game is a must-play for any strategy fan, but it&#x2019;s also a good starter title for anyone who is interested in breaking into the genre.</desc>

		<desc>1990 saw the release of Lords of War on the Amiga systems, a Breakout clone game with interesting idea, created and distributed by Digital Concepts.

On every screen, there is a castle defended by a movable shield. The shield can be moved horizontally and vertically (always along the castle wall). The goal is to bring down the walls of one of the other castles within a given time limit. If no one does this in time, the game automatically switches to "fast speed" until the first slot is shattered.

The well animated graphic looks decent, changes from level to level and the scrolling is nice. The sound effects are according to the atmosphere, beautifully creepy - timely. You can not complain about the joystick control either. What else is there? Menu with numerous options (faster, slower, etc.), pause function, highscore list. The gameplay is not exactly the latest, but the original presentation and the built-in gags, The Lords of War lift something of the usual breakout monotony from. After all...</desc>

		<desc>You and your squad are on their way back from R&amp;R in Saigon to your operations base when Viet Cong guerillas force your helicopter to crash land in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. It's now your responsibility to lead the remaining survivors to the nearest U.S. base, evading or facing an elusive and dangerous enemy on his own grounds.

Most of the time, you'll see a map of the country on the screen and navigate your men through the country. It's important to watch your men's health and morale by getting them food, water, ammo and letting them rest, etc. When reaching certain spots on the map, e.g. a native village, the game presents the current situation in a nice graphic scene. Sometimes you'll run into V.C. snipers, patrols, whole ambushes or encounter minefields. Then the game offers some small arcade sequences like firing your guns or fighting it out in desperate hand-to-hand combat. The progress of your party is accompanied by video sequences from the Vietnam War.

Lost Patrol is a survival action role-playing game with strategy elements developed by the team Shadow Development and published by Ocean Software Ltd for Amiga computers in 1990 and the Atari ST in 1991; a DOS version was also released by Astros Productions.</desc>

		<desc>The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on.

		<desc>The Lost Vikings is a side-scrolling platform puzzle game with a twist. Instead of one character who can jump, run, shoot, collect items, flip switches and so on, there are three different characters, each with his own skills. Eric the Swift can jump, run and bash through walls with his tough helmet. Olaf the Stout has a shield which can block attacks, function as an air glider or as a step to stand on. Baleog the Fierce can shoot things with his arrows (including switches) or kill things with his sword. The player has to use the three Vikings as a team if he wants to get past the increasingly difficult levels and puzzles.</desc>

		<desc>Lothar Matthus is a solid soccer simulation from Audiogenic, published by OCEAN. Despite bearing the name of one of Germany's best players, the game's scope is not as large as the likes of Champion Manager; instead, the game focuses on tactics and action-oriented gameplay where you can control each player directly. The game strikes a good balance between action and tactics, although neither element is as good as the best of each camp. Choose to lead your favorite club from five European countries (England, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany) in a friendly match, league, or cup play. Overall, Lothar Matth&amp;#228;us is a decent beer-and-pretzel soccer simulation/action game that doesn't take itself too seriously. Good as a quick fix, but lacking in long-term play value to warrant repeated play.</desc>

		<desc>The first in a series of 3 racing games endorsed by the legendary car company, which is now a part of Proton.

The game features a total of 32 fictitious racetracks from around the world, split into 3 difficulty levels. There are 19 computer opponents (15 on the 8-bit versions) and you have to finish in the top 10 (top 8 on the 8-bits) to progress. The higher you finish in one race, the lower down the grid you start for the next race. The opposition drivers have pun names based on the F1 drivers of the day - examples include Ricardo Pastry and Crashhard Banger.

You can choose between sound effects or one of a variety of music pieces. The game features a simultaneous 2-player mode, but the 1-player mode only uses half the screen, a simple animation filling the other half. In most races you will have to make a pitstop for fuel in order to reach the finish. The tracks include features such as oil slicks, roadworks, boulders and rivers - contact with these (or the other cars) will slow you, but there is no car damage model.</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;Feel the thrill of accelerating from 0 to 60 in 4.7 seconds as you race 
&amp;gt;head to head over hills, through valleys and around vicious bends 
&amp;gt;gripping the wheel of your Lotus Esprit Turbo.
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;
















***Lotus Esprit Turbo Challenge*** was the first game in the series was 
released in 1990 for most popular contemporary 8-bit and 16-bit computer 
systems, the Amiga version being the most technically advanced. The game 
allowed the player to race a Lotus Esprit Turbo SE car through several 
(32 in the Amiga version) circuit race tracks of varying scenery.  
Two player simultaneous play (with split screen) was also provided, 
and a choice of audio tracks to accompany races.
















Each track is lap-based and consists of turns of varying degrees, as 
well as hills and hollows which slow down or speed up the car passing 
through them. Each turn is indicated by a chain of road-side signs, 
and the difficulty of the turn is reflected by the number and density 
of these signs - a feature common to all titles in the Lotus series.
















While racing, the players must manage their fuel supply, occasionally 
visiting the pit stop for refuelling. Also apart from overtaking the 
other cars, the racers must avoid various hazards and obstacles. These 
are dependent on the scenery the track is located in, and include 
slippery road on the winter courses, road blocks, slippery puddles and 
wooden logs.
















The tracks are split into three race series, with different difficulty levels. In each race the player or players compete against 20 opponents. The goal is to finish each race on the highest possible position; if the player finishes a race within the first 10 places they qualify for the next race and receive points towards a final position on the high-score table. The names of the computer-controlled drivers are puns on the names of real-life racers of the time ("Ayrton Sendup", "Nijel Mainsail" and "Alain Phosphate" for example).
















Unusually, the player's starting position in each race is the exact opposite of the position reached at the end of the previous one. This gives weaker players a chance to improve by starting in a higher position.
















When racing in the one-player mode, the bottom half of the screen is unused and features a static image of the Esprit Turbo. In the two-player mode one half is used by each player. The two-player feature operates similarly to the one-player mo</desc>

		<desc>The third game in the series combined the gameplay aspects of its predecessors, allowing players to choose between racing opponents of Lotus Turbo Challenge or the arcade-like time trials of Lotus 2. The two-player option was retained and the music selection feature returns (Patrick Phelan's soundtrack to Lotus III spawned many modern remixes). Lotus III also added a third car - a concept Lotus M200 automobile - and allowed the player to choose which one to race with. The game recycled most of the graphics from Lotus 2, but added a number of new sceneries.

The Genesis/Mega Drive version bears the name Lotus II: RECS (referring to the game's new course creation feature) or simply Lotus II depending on country of release, while the MS-DOS port released in 1993 was called Lotus: The Ultimate Challenge. The MS-DOS version features the Lotus Esprit S4 instead of the Esprit Turbo SE. Apart from the slightly different car's graphics, the difference in gameplay is minimal, if any. The MS-DOS version was released again in 1996, this time on a CD-ROM.

Lotus III features a Racing Environment Construction Set (RECS) course creation system. The system allows users to create a race track by defining various basic parameters, such as amount and difficulty of turns and hills, amount of obstacles, type of scenery or difficulty of opponents. The created track can then be raced by one or both players. The course can also be written in form of a letter-and-digit code and later reused; these can be raced individually or in a series of up to nine user-created tracks.

The RECS system allows players to quickly create a unique track without having to use a course editor; however, it sacrificed the facility of precisely positioning turns or obstacles. The RECS system was later reused in another Magnetic Fields' game, International Rally Championship.

The Amiga and Genesis versions of Lotus III again contain a hidden game, accessed by the password CU AMIGA in the Amiga version and POD PLEASE on the Genesis. The game is a graphically enhanced remake of Southern and Morris' Commodore 64 game POD.[4]</desc>

		<desc>The second Lotus game shifted focus to arcade-oriented gameplay. Being the first of the series released for a game console (for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive under the title Lotus Turbo Challenge), the fuel limit and difficulty levels were dropped, and the lap-based levels were replaced with course-based time trials, (not unlike arcade games such as Out Run), with the player required to complete each course within a specified time to qualify for the next one.

In addition to the Esprit Turbo SE, Lotus Turbo Challenge 2 also featured the Lotus Elan SE, hence 'Esprit' being dropped from the title. There was no choice of car however; the player runs with the Elan SE on odd levels, and with the Esprit on even levels.

Lotus 2's single-player mode uses all of the game screen instead of half, and opponent cars appear in a variety of colors (opponent cars in the original game were all white). However, music is absent from racing altogether; the player instead hears the car's engine sound.

Lotus 2 was developed for the Amiga and then converted for the other platforms.</desc>

		<desc>M.U.D.S. (Mean Ugly Dirty Sports) is a slightly humorous but definitely violent game in which the game itself is won by scoring at least 7 out of 14 goals or by killing enough of the opposing team. Tackles, pummelings, being thrown into the moat -where a shark-like thing will eat you if you don't get out on time- are just some of the things that can happen to your team.

Of course, there are more ways to win: bribing the opposing team, the referee, or the creature which is used as the ball are worth considering.

Should your team need a little extra morale, just pick a fight, or buy and sell players on the slave market whenever you like.

M.U.D.S. vaguely resembles Speedball in the sense that you try to throw the ball in the opponent's goal, but that's where the resemblance ends for me.</desc>

		<desc>Professor Mariarti is, as the game title suggests, a mad scientist. Not all of his experiments worked out the way they should and now he needs to shut down the power in five of his labs (the first four can be tackled in any order). This plays out as a standard platformer: Mariarti jumps over gaps between platforms and dodges enemies (he can take a few hits before dying) until he reaches the end of the level, i.e. the off switch.

At the start of the game he only throw wrenches to defend himself, but during the game he finds coins scattered around the labs. Those can be used to buy more advanced weapons like a laser cannon. However, killed enemies respawn after a short time. To proceed he also needs to solve a few puzzles by collecting items and bringing them to the correct place. There are also a number of switch puzzles.</desc>

The next day, as you wander around the television station looking for her, you run into the boss of Mad TV. Having just fired his executive producer, he hires you. (You're not limited to Mad TV, however; you can also hire yourself in one of the competing stations, Fun TV or Sun TV). 

Your objective in this game is to push your ratings to the top by buying and selling movies and features, choosing the news, and even producing your own shows. You must also earn money by putting in commercials. Be careful, if you don't show commercials by their due date, you'll end up owing, instead of earning. And all this while trying to impress the woman you saw on TV.</desc>

		<desc>This is a budget game and budget games have a preordained right to have an element of tackiness, right? Wrong. Since the dawn of time it seems that only one out of every fifteen new budget titles were good, and it looks like staying that way on the Amiga.

Set in Egypt you play the part of the cat goddess Mafdet who is trying to recover the Book of the Dead which has been stolen by the evil god Seth and unless it is recovered no Egyptian will be able to enter the afterlife.

Being a god Mafdet can transform into a cat as well as her normal human form. In cat mode Mafdet can run, jump and pick up objects - not too much use against the minions of Seth, but at least they don't notice you. As a woman you can swing a fairly brutal sword.

The general playing area is large, and I found myself noticing a new exit from the screens just as I thought I was stuck. Some exits are too low to allow the woman to pass through until you run into them with the cat. Other times a hole in the floor is the best way through.

The graphics are really large, though the animation and definition fail to make any lasting impact. As well as not being exactly too pretty to look at the main character is also impossible to control accurately. Mafdet is depressing to play, it's not that cheap and it most definitely isn't cheerful.</desc>

		<desc>Magic Johnson's Basketball is a decent arcade-style basketball game starring LA Lakers' superstar Magic Johnson, one of the most famous players of all time. It is a direct translation of the popular coin-op arcade game called Magic Johnson's Fastbreak Basketball. Like the arcade original, the game is easy enough for beginners to learn, and challenging enough for experts. You can play against the computer or another human opponent in a hot-seat mode.

As an arcade-oriented game, Magic Johnson's Basketball is pretty good. You can shoot 3-pointers, perform slam dunks, and of course Magic Johnson's famous fast break with a slam dunk finish. The game includes a good training sequence, demo mode, and smooth animation.

When compared with other basketball games made during the same period, Magic Johnson's Basketball falls flat with many limitations. You can only play a single game, unlike the entire season that Ed Ringler's Omni-Play Basketball (also a Magic Johnson-promoted game) simulates. And the on-court action is far from the fun of EA's 1988 classic One on One: Jordan vs. Bird. Without the competition, Magic Johnson's Basketball would have been considered a great game. But basketball fans simply have many better choices to choose from than this game.</desc>

		<desc>In Magic Pockets, players control the cool Bitmap Kid who has deep pockets that can store virtually anything. Bitmap Kid's mission is to get back his toys that were stolen by some creatures.

The game is a side-scrolling shooter that plays out across four worlds inhabited by a variety of enemies. Players can cause more damage to these enemies by charging their shots before firing. The player's weapon also changes its shape and features according to the requirements of each world.

Bitmap Kid has special athletic abilities. He can jump high by stepping on whirlwinds and can even destroy all the creatures he hits after falling down from a high place. In addition, players can drive a bike, dive, and even fly through the use of special items.</desc>

		<desc>Magicland Dizzy is a platform adventure game published in Europe in 1990 by Codemasters for the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amiga platforms.   It is the sixth game in the Dizzy series, and the fourth adventure-based Dizzy title. The story, set in a fantasy world called Magicland, follows on from the events of Fantasy World Dizzy, the previous adventure title. In Magicland Dizzy the player controls Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, who is trying to save six of his friends who have been placed under spells by the Evil Wizard Zaks.

In Magicland Dizzy the player guides Dizzy, an egg-shaped character, through a large maze in an attempt to rescue his six friends who are held captive under the influence of various magic spells. The locations are all located in the titular "Magicland" and are fantastical in nature, many inspired by fairy tales. They include a field of standing stones called Weirdhenge, a witch's island and Prince Charming's castle. Movement from one screen to the next is enabled through flip-screen such that when Dizzy touches the outer edge of one screen he is transported to the next. The individual screens consist of platforms and ladders with Dizzy able to both walk and jump to navigate the maze and its obstacles. Dizzy can collect up to three items at once which are then used at specific locations to solve puzzles and advance through the game. At the start of the game the player has three lives and a health bar which can be replenished by finding and collecting diamonds scattered throughout the maze.</desc>

		<desc>In Major Motion, The Draconian League have taken over the roads and made them dangerous for ordinary road users. You are in control of a car, driving up a vertically scrolling road with occasional forks in it, making the game similar to Spy Hunter. 

The car is mounted with guns, and so are many enemy cars, but cars can be rammed off the road as well as shot. Watch out for other enemy vehicles such as helicopters though; be sure to avoid their bullets.

You can drive into the back of open lorries to gain upgraded weapons. Weapons are activated via keyboard presses, which makes the game more difficult than it would otherwise be. Sound and music sampled from suitably action-packed films aims to add to the atmosphere.</desc>

		<desc>After Manchester United won the English League championship for the first time since 1967, it was no surprise that Krisalis re-used their existing license for a third licensed football game. Little did they know that the club was entering an unprecedented run of success that has continued well into the 2010s.

The basic control system will be familiar to anyone who&#x2019;s played a Kick Off game, as it involves holding fire to trap the ball under your player&#x2019;s foot, and releasing fire to pass, although the ball will be kicked onwards if it is moving fast when it comes to you. Other gameplay features include diving headers, variable pitch conditions, penalty shoot-outs and accurate deflections. 2500 players featured in the game all had a range of varied ability statistics, as well as different skin tones.

As well as individual matches and custom-created tournaments (which have much the same range of features as Sensible Soccer, plus full calculation of injury and suspension severities, including disciplinary points and differing injury lengths), you can play out a full season of matches for any club in England&#x2019;s top 5 divisions &#x2013; all domestic league and cup matches are included, with promotions and relegations taking place after each season. The Tacti-Grid editor allows for advanced match tactics to be configured and experimented with.

		<desc>Krisalis' fourth licensed Manchester United game - the title refers to their success in winning both the Premier League and the FA Cup in the same (93-94) season -- something only six clubs have achieved.

The gameplay is overhead view, and has much in common with Kick Off, offering loose control, a range of moves, and an emphasis on short passing. It's not easy at first, but persistence reaps rewards, especially with a two-button controller.

Making life easier is the Tacti-Grid tactics editor, which allowed you to customise tactics by instructing players on exactly where they go when the ball is in a particular position. The editor is the most comprehensive ever seen in an action football game, allowing you to rename players, change their appearance and skills, transfer them across clubs, move clubs around the divisions, change their kits, and more.</desc>

The game continues the story depicted in Manhunter: New York. The game begins with the player, piloting an Orb ship in pursuit of the antagonist Phil Cook, crash-landing in San Francisco. Another Manhunter on the ground is killed in the crash, so the player assumes his identity. As the gameplay progresses, the player learns of an organized resistance, experiments that have created mutant slaves, and the goal of the malevolent Orbs. The game reaches its climax when the player is on the verge of catching Phil Cook. Phil narrowly escapes in an Orb ship with the player hanging on to the outside, flying off towards London</desc>

		<desc>Manhunter: New York is a post-apocalyptic adventure game designed by Barry Murry, Dave Murry and Dee Dee Murry of Evryware and published in 1988 by Sierra On-Line. A sequel, Manhunter 2: San Francisco, was released the next year in 1989.
It is set in the (then) futuristic year of 2004, when Earth has been enslaved by a race of aliens known as the Orbs. The Orbs, who look like giant floating eyeballs, have implanted all humans with global tracking devices, forced them to wear nondescript robes and forbid them from speaking or communicating. The protagonist has been assigned by the Orbs to track down fellow humans who are believed to be forming an underground resistance. Over the course of the game, the player discovers that the Orbs are not the benevolent rulers they claim to be; they are actually harvesting humans as a food source. The player then "switches sides" and works to overthrow the Orbs.</desc>

		<desc>The Edison mansion has always been a creepy old house on the edge of town. There have been rumors of strange experiments going on and of odd creatures living amongst the Edison family. There is even a story that a meteorite once crashed near the home nearly 20 years ago. More immediately, a girl named Sandy has gone missing from the local highschool and her boyfriend Dave swears that he saw Dr. Fred abducting her. Dave knows that he cannot do it alone and will need help from two other students if he has any hope of infiltrating the mansion and rescuing Sandy.

Players start by choosing two students to accompany Dave to the Edison mansion, and can then switch between these three characters at will. Most actions are carried out by selecting verbs on the screen and applying them to an object (such as "OPEN Door"). Each character maintains a separate personality and may have a different way to solve a problem from his classmates. Thus many of the puzzles can be overcome in different ways depending on the character being used. If any one of the kids are captured by the Edisons, they are thrown into the dungeon and must be rescued themselves by any character who still has their freedom.</desc>

		<desc>The idea of this arcade game is deceptively simple: Guide a marble down a path without hitting any obstacles or straying off the course. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, which makes it harder to stay focused on the direction the ball is to follow. There are tight corridors to follow and enemies to avoid. There is a 2-player mode in which players must race to the finish; otherwise you're racing against the clock.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you play Strip poker against Maria Whittaker, an UK model of the 1980s. As the name suggests, she is first wearing a Santa Claus suit and does not get completely naked like in previous games of this type.

The gameplay is very similar to Ancos older game Strip Poker II+. In the game itself you can raise bets and can trade each cloth part for 100 credits if you are running out of cash and your hand is too good to not raise. There are two different difficulty levels, "Easy" and "Hard". The AI does sometimes bluffing with aggressive bets.</desc>

		<desc>One of the most console-style platformers ever seen on the Amiga, Marvin has approximately 60 levels to battle through. There are stars to collect, extra lives on offer, slides, tubes, ladders, caterpillars to move across, and bonus fruit to collect.
The levels are inhabited by typical enemies, some of which are killed by jumping on their heads, while others must be kicked or shot (once you collect a weapon).
Many of the annoyances which plague platform games, such as blind jumps and spikes appearing at random, are deliberately absent from this. The graphics are intentionally cute, using the AGA chip-set for 256 colours.</desc>

		<desc>1996 saw the release of Master Blaster on the Amiga systems, a Bomberman clone, created by Alpha Brothers and distributed by Nexus as a Shareware. Master Blaster v2.21 was later made freeware and is available for download on Aminet.

This game is based on the idea of Bomberman. You can play with up to 5 enemies at the same time. The main goal is to survive and kill all the other enemies. You can do this by placing bombs on the ground. They will destroy the brick walls around you and may even release some extras to collect.

Very good Bomberman/DynaBlaster clone that only focus is on the VS Battle aspect of the game. It remains one of the best multiplayer PD games ever!</desc>

		<desc>Masterblazer is both a remake of and a follow-up to the Lucasfilm Games game Ballblazer.

Ballblazer is a futuristic sport played in vehicles called "Rotofoils". The play field is a large rectangle made out of squares. The object of the game is to get a ball called "Plasmorb" into the goal, which moves along the edge of the play field. Otherwise, the rules are simple: "Three minutes, two players, one victor!" The game is played in first-person on a split screen and can be played by either one or two players.

Compared to Ballblazer, Masterblazer offers two new playing options: a Tournament Mode and a Rotofoil Race.</desc>

All cars are equipped with weapons which can be used to destroy the opposition. Other things to keep in mind are holes on the track which need to be jumped over and power ups which offer advantages when picked up, e.g. more speed. Permission to start at the next race is only given if the player finishes the race among the first three. Between races the car and its weapon system can be upgraded.</desc>

		<desc>Car racing games have always been a favourite on the Amiga, especially top-down racers where you can take on your mates. MAX Rally hopes to build on the playability and graphic appeal of previous classics such as Skidmarks and Micro Machines and bring the whole genre up to date.

As well as being able to play against up to four human players, various other racing modes are available, including racing against computer cars, racing against the clock or participating in a Championship or Max Challenge. There are twenty different tracks and four different types of terrain (Woodland, Cosmic, Alpine and Dunes) to be negotiated.

Link up games are also possible, so you can play two player split-screen, two player link up or four player split-screen link up. If you don't have two Amigas to stick together you can play in a battle mode where the slowest cars are eliminated as they fall off the screen.

MAX Rally fails to inspire. It's fun for a little while, in a sub-Skidmarks sort of way, but the computer opponents are too easy and the multiplayer mode isn't imaginative enough to retain interest for long. It's like the original Micro Machines, only half a decade late. Five years ago, maybe.</desc>

		<desc>In Mayday Squad, the Lutonian Embassy has been taken over by the Red Legion terror organisation and the ambassador's daughter has been kidnapped. The player takes the role of a group of three special agents which have to save her within a time limit. The player has to choose between nine soldiers which are divided into three categories: leader (shooting), demolition (grenades) and communication (opening locks and picking up items). The soldiers within the same category also have different advantages and weaknesses. Also chosen before starting the mission is the difficulty level and hit points of the team members. During the game itself, one member is controlled by the player and the others by the AI. However, to perform special actions it is possible to instantly switch between them. This is needed because there are a lot of options how to proceed in the maze-like embassy, e.g. players may choose to open a lock or shoot it open. While a large portion of the game is dedicated to finding the way and searching for clues which hint to the daughter's location, there are also strong action elements: When meeting enemies and controlling the leader, the cursor has to be quickly moved over the opponents to shoot them before they can damage the team. Resources like ammo are limited.</desc>

		<desc>Mega Motion is a puzzle game where the player has to move a number of balls across the screen towards an exit. The balls are linked together with one acting as an anchor the others are constantly rotating around. The game is played with the mouse. By clicking on one of the balls it becomes the anchor that the others rotate around. Clicking with the right mouse button changes the direction of the rotation.

Each level has obstacles that block the balls' path and objects that can be collected. Most common are blocks that are destroyed after being hit by a ball a couple of times but there are also those obstacles that destroy the ball that hits them. There are also bombs, which set off chain reactions when hit, and switcher blocks that reveal hidden doors or open up new passages. When all balls but one have been destroyed a life is lost and the level has to be restarted. Each level also has a time limit. Overstepping it is allowed but the player will then get a lower score.

The game has a total of 100 levels that are divided into four categories: easy, average, difficult and very difficult. For every level completed the player is given a password.</desc>

		<desc>You start your mission with a lone starfighter with some very puny lasers. At this stage it's still got a very handy set of lasers with which you can take out just about anything moving, but you'll have to set your joystick to auto-fire. While Mega Typhoon is a typical vertical shoot-em-up, you can move a little to the left and right while picking up some useful extra laser power ups, missiles, homing missiles, side-shots and extra lives.

You can also press the space bar which activates a smart bomb weapon that effectively wipes out any opposing enemy ships in the vicinity. Once you've got to grips with what's going on, it's on to the next world.

The game is fast, and the action is as frenetic as anything you've seen on the Amiga in a long while... but the in-game graphics are pretty basic and colourless. The sound is sadly lacking with only a few effects for explosions and lasers and a racey-but-unobtrusive soundtrack at the beginning.

Mega Typhoon is a playable game, it's just that I've seen the Amiga do better with Hybris, Battle Squadron, Swiv or Xenon 2. It is an average game that hasn't really much to offer the already saturated shoot-em-up genre. Which is a shame because we all know that the Amiga can do so much better than this.</desc>

		<desc>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. 
Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.
Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level</desc>

		<desc>1991 saw the release of MegaBall on the Amiga systems, a Breakout clone, created and distributed by Ed Mackey and Al Mackey as a Shareware.

You all know how to play an Arkanoid clone, right?  I don't have to explain that you have a paddle and a ball and you must bounce the ball into some blocks to score points, right?  And I certainly don't need to mention that if you let the ball miss the paddle and drop off the screen you will die, right?  And I also don't need to explain about how little bonuses can drift down from the blocks and if they touch your paddle they can do anything from giving you free lives to blowing you up, depending on the little pictures on the bonuses as they are drifting down, right?
Good. I was afraid I'd have to put a lengthy explanation here!

		<desc>The game takes place within the fictional universe in which prior Traveller releases are also set. The most significant power in this universe is the human-dominated Imperium which predominates across thousands of inhabited solar systems. Bordering the regions controlled by the Imperium are other interstellar powers including the Zhodani Consulate. The Imperium and the Zhodani have a long history of tense relations and, as the game begins, rumors of another frontier war are circulating. Against this backdrop, a security agent working for Sharushid, a large corporation active throughout the Imperium, discovers that a company sub-sector chief named Konrad Kiefer is secretly aiding the Zhodani by smuggling arms across the border into the hands of dissidents in preparation for an uprising within the Imperium to be coordinated with a Zhodani attack. This security agent encounters five experienced adventurers in a bar on the planet Efate and entrusts them with evidence of Kiefer's treachery. These adventurers are tasked with delivering the evidence to a second Sharushid agent located in another solar system and ultimately with stopping Kiefer and his conspiracy against the Imperium. The player assumes control over the party just after the security agent entrusts it with the evidence against Kiefer.</desc>

		<desc>Six ruthless dictators have collaborated to create the planet Draconia, which contains some of the most gruesome and harmful life-forms imaginable, all indulging in some rather unsavoury actions. Thus, you must go in your spaceship to destroy them all.

The game is a side-scrolling R-Type-influenced shoot 'em up consisting of six visually-diverse levels. Waves of enemies come towards you to be shot, and reveal tokens, which when shot at will cycle through several available weapons. These include lasers, cannons, improved ship power and a shield.</desc>

		<desc>Due to an engine malfunction, your spaceship crashes on the planet Targ. Unlike your trusty vessel, you survive the crash and now have to find a way to get away from this planet. But hey, while you're at it, you might as well try to get some money off your unplanned stay on Targ.

You're a mercenary, and it just so happens that the two races on the planet are at war. So why not use that to your advantage and do some favors for each race... against cash?

You play this game in a first-person perspective with vector graphics. There's a huge planet for you to explore, you can walk around on it or take airborne vehicles to reach elevated locations.</desc>

		<desc>The Dion Crisis is the third part of the Mercenary trilogy, following on from where Damocles left off. You once again find yourself in a race against time to save the galaxy, this time from the evil PC BIL.

Again the non-linear nature of this series is taken further in the vast number of ways you can stop the tyrant. Exploration of the game's large number of planets and moons will reveal clues of the many different routes you can take to achieve this goal. Run for president, become a property tycoon - or a violent 'eco' terrorist. The 'go anywhere, do anything' motto is still in full effect in this first-person perspective hybrid game.</desc>

		<desc>Mercs is a shoot 'em up influenced by Ikari Warriors. You are an anti-terrorism soldier, and must rescue a former President from a Central African revolutionary gang. 

You run through each of the 8 levels, which primarily scroll horizontally, shooting everyone before they can shoot you. At times you will have to shoot trees and other scenery to progress. 

Finding strategic placings is important, especially as you can't shoot while on water. Most of the time you are on foot, but at times you can hijack vehicles of shot foes. There are improved weapons, smart bombs and energy recharges to collect. Each of the 8 levels ends with a large vehicle requiring multiple shots to destroy.</desc>

Your objective is to drive around Miami, looking for red cars and shooting them away, within a time limit for each level. Avoid hitting buildings or other cars, and don't shoot too many civilian cars or you are history. If you drive erratically in the vicinity of other cop cars they will stop you, costing valuable time. You can use a map of the city to help you find your targets.</desc>

		<desc>You know that castle thingy that you see on the titles of The Wonderful World of Disney, the one that looks all peaceful an' everythin'? Well, all is not as it seems. Inside the tower Mickey is fighting for peace, justice and the American way.

Merlin the magician has had his magic wand stolen by the evil Ogre King. The wand has been split into four pieces and given to witches at the top of the towers in the castle. The ogre has put ghosties and ghoulies and things in the towers to try and stop you from getting the wand back together, but you are armed with a squirt gun and a hammer to deal with them. Eventually you just seal up the doors and stop them from emerging. This is done by entering a series of sub-games: The Puddle Maze, The bubble Machine, The Pump Room and The Dripping Taps. At the top of each tower is a guardian thingie that must be shot in the head to retrieve a piece of the wand.

In my experience, cartoon character licences very rarely make good computer games, but I'm glad to say that the most famous of them all has managed to keep his reputation by spawning a cracker of a game. The graphics are nicely detailed and coloured, the ghostly music is more funny than spooky, creating exactly the right atmosphere to suit the already amusing gameplay - smacking teddy bears over the head is great fun.</desc>

		<desc>If you're bored of racing Formula 1 cars, rally cars or MotoGP bikes in their natural habitats, the Micro Machines series could be for you. It involves racing miniatures representing particular vehicle types across a particular terrain found around the house. The Sports Cars race on the desktop, 4x4s in the sandpit, Formula 1 cars on a snooker table, and so on.

These levels were packed with variation. The Snooker tables has the track painted on, although this is open to deviation (as are most levels), and had you racing through the pockets and across the rim of the table. Tanks raced as well, with the chance of shooting out your opponent if they got directly in front of you. The desktop levels include binders to jump across, pencil-sharpeners to avoid, and lots of visual jokes in the open homework.

Viewed from overhead with small graphics, the races include up to 4 cars. In one player challenge mode you race through the 21 tracks in a set order, selecting your 3 opponents as you go along (adding a fair amount of strategy - ideally you should aim to eliminate the better CPU cars early on), eliminating one after every third race (assuming that you can finish in the top 2 of a race within your 3 lives). If you win 3 races in a row without using a continue you get a time-trial race which can earn you an extra life.</desc>

		<desc>MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix is a racing simulator released in 1991 by MicroProse and created by game designer Geoff Crammond.

One of the first games to implement something that resembled "real world" racing physics, accurate track modelling and car handling that required skills somewhat similar to real-world driving skills to perform well. Also one of the first to offer meaningful options to tune the behaviour of the cars. Although not quite on the level of later simulations, the most important variables, such as gear ratios, tyre compounds and wing settings were available to tune and, more importantly, proved to make an actual difference when driving. Important were also the functional rearview mirrors and an "instant replay" system with a wide range of adjustable camera settings not seen in other games of the era.

The accurately modelled tracks meant that the player could actually recognise their location on the real-life circuit. The detailed physics engine provided a more realistic driving experience than had been seen before, drivers could easily experience the differences in handling depending on how you entered a corner and how soon or late you accelerated out of it. Unlike other racing simulations of the time, the accuracy of the simulation actually made the 1/1000 of a second chronometer meaningful, as races could be won or lost by a few thousandths of a second. Vitally, the combination of graphics and physics meant players could actually "feel" whether they were driving fast or slow, and could predict how the car would respond. Even details such as tyre wear were modelled throughout the race, qualifying tyres are an extreme example of this: players could not drive more than a couple of laps without beginning to lose grip and eventually spinning out on nearly every corner. Together with the 16 tracks and the atmosphere-packed rendition of complete Grand Prix weekends, it made F1GP a favourite with Formula One and racing sim fans for many years, and is still referred to occasionally in current reviews as a classic benchmark.</desc>

		<desc>MicroProse Formula One Grand Prix is a racing simulator released in 1991 by MicroProse and created by game designer Geoff Crammond.

One of the first games to implement something that resembled "real world" racing physics, accurate track modelling and car handling that required skills somewhat similar to real-world driving skills to perform well. Also one of the first to offer meaningful options to tune the behaviour of the cars. Although not quite on the level of later simulations, the most important variables, such as gear ratios, tyre compounds and wing settings were available to tune and, more importantly, proved to make an actual difference when driving. Important were also the functional rearview mirrors and an "instant replay" system with a wide range of adjustable camera settings not seen in other games of the era.

		<desc>The game consists of two different soccer simulations, you can carry out a match in the stadium or indoors. The field is always shown from the top and scrolled softly into all directions.

Different game modes make for diversity. Up to 15 players can enter their names and then compete with each other in a league. One can also take part in a World Cup, whereby the venue corresponds to the one of a real World Cup. The computer takes over the controls of as many teams as needed. A two-player friendly can be played head to head.

The game offers features as "banana kick",  "action replay" and  weather.

The original was developed by Sensible Software for the C64, Electronic Pencil Company were responsible for the Amiga and Atari ST versions.</desc>

		<desc>Midnight Resistance is a side-scrolling action shooting game produced by Data East for the arcades in 1989. The game was ported by Data East to the Sega Mega Drive in 1990 and by Ocean Software to various home computer platforms during the same year. The game is set in a dystopian future where the player controls a member of a resistance movement who goes on a mission to rescue his kidnapped family from a mad scientist.</desc>

		<desc>Midwinter is set in a post-apocalyptic world, as the Earth entered a nuclear winter caused by the fall of a meteorite. The titular island has been formed in the Azores group of islands, caused by volcanic activity.

The player initially controls Captain John Stark, the commander of local militia known as Free Villages Police Force (FVPF), who attempt to protect their home from the invasion of armed troops under the command of General Masters. As Stark, the player has to recruit civilians and members of FVPF in order to join forces and prevent Masters from reaching the base located in the south-eastern part of the island.

Midwinter is a hybrid game that combines elements of strategy and action. The player selects and controls the 32 recruits as they attempt to protect the island within a limited amount of time. Two hours of game time are assigned to each recruit; afterwards, the strategy battle moves to the next turn. During their turns, the recruits fight enemy forces in action-oriented combat reminiscent of a first-person shooter. Specific and detailed injuries add a tactical edge to these battles. Enemy units are mostly composed of armed snow buggies, as well as supply vehicles. Eliminating a large amount of them or killing the commander of the unit usually successfully completes the mission.

Terrain plays an important role in the game, as many snow-covered mountain areas are impassable, and the player must plan ahead how to advance. The player can use snow buggies, ski, and cable cars to access the goal.

When recruiting characters, the player has to pay attention to their personal relationships. For example, Stark can recruit his girlfriend, but another character will refuse to join because he is in love with her and jealous of the Captain.</desc>

		<desc>The closest comparison to this action game would be Afterburner, a game which was overdue a decent home computer re-creation. You view the game slightly behind your plane, which must shoot out enemy planes, tanks and installations while avoiding their fire. You are armed with different kinds of weapons including downward bombs, air-to-air missiles and a nuclear bomb. More of each of these can be picked up by collecting the parachutes which are dropped into your path. There are mountain ranges, deserts and arctic scenes to clear along the way, with big boss planes to face.</desc>

		<desc>The MiG-29 plane, nicknamed Fulcrum by the West, features in this flight simulation, professionally modeled by former British Aerospace flight simulator designers. You are armed with cannons, rockets and Air-to-Air and Air-to-Ground missiles. Aerodynamics, blackouts and physics are all recreated. There are six missions to take on, starting with your basic training. 

After this, there are four diverse missions with colour-coded identification, and a final extra-tough mission you can only do once you have successfully completed the others. The missions involve arctic reconnaissance, dogfighting over the Great Wall of China, an oil refinery, and destroying terrorist infrastructure. Your final task involves destroying a nuclear plant in the desert. Missions have primary and secondary objectives affecting scoring.</desc>

		<desc>Taking off from where MiG-29 Fulcrum left off, Simis created a new simulator based around the top-modern MiG-29M. The M model has been equipped with modernised avionics, a fly-by-wire system and stronger engines. 

As opposed to its predecessor, Super Fulcrum takes place in one big scenario instead of single missions. Your task is to represent the Soviet Union in a UN force sent to South America to defend a small country that is being threatened by a bigger and stronger neighbour. The game is relatively open-ended, allowing you to fulfill your missions in the way you see fit instead of monitoring your every step. All missions and their results are handled in your pilot's log.</desc>

		<desc>The Sequel to the successful Might and Magic I, it boasted better graphics, a larger world, but still pretty much the same game engine and presentation. Embark on a glorious journey then save the world of CRON and yourself.

A balanced party is a necessity in this game. There are several locations and items that are restricted to certain genders, alignments, or races. A party made up of Good Human Males won't get you very far. Time plays a large role in this game. Time travel is a part of it, but on a more basic level, you will find that characters age as the game goes on. If you wait too long, your characters' statistics will change to reflect their aging.

Although M&amp;M II is polished to fairly high sheen and is interesting to delve in to it's not a thinking player's game, but if you like a lot of mapping interspersed with the odd hack' n 'slay bout then you Might think this RPG Magic.</desc>

		<desc>A party of brave heroes managed to defeat the corrupted guardian Sheltem as he attempted to destroy the world of CRON. However, the great battle between the guardians Corak and Sheltem continued in another place - the world of Terra, where Sheltem was originally appointed as a guardian. Revolting against the powerful race of the Ancients, Sheltem takes possession of their space-traveling nacelles, hurling them at the suns of other planets. It is now up to a group of local adventurers to help Corak and vanquish Sheltem once and for all.

Isles of Terra is the third installment in the Might and Magic series, and a sequel to Gates to Another World. Like its predecessors, it is a role-playing game focusing on first-person exploration of vast pseudo-3D environments, character building, and turn-based combat. The five selectable races remain the same as in the previous games, as well as the eight character classes with the addition of two new ones: Druid and Ranger. Like in the second game, characters may learn unique skills such as thievery, swimming, merchant, and others.

This installment does away with random or pre-set enemy encounters, featuring instead enemies dynamically roaming the game world, allowing to initiate combat from a distance (for example with ranged attacks or spells). There is no option to bribe or surrender to enemies, and escaping combat can be accomplished simply by moving away, unless the enemies have already locked on the party. An automap feature is available at all times, and the player is also allowed to save the game at any time.</desc>

The game now features new scenarios like clouds and forests, as well as the usual sphinx and pyramids backgrounds of the original title.</desc>

		<desc>As you can guess from the title, Mikro Mortal Tennis is basically founded on tennis game, but its goal is to eliminate your opponents, not simply to defeat them! To this purpose, players might make use of loads of Mortal-Kombat and Street-Fighter-like special moves, in addition to many others, directly taken from lots of famous videogames or films. Besides, there are bombs, Fire'n'forget rockets, heat-seeking missiles at their complete disposal... The game boasts an amusing animated intro which will explain the reason of such a strange tournamnet - by the way, your order is to climb a high mountain, just like the second episode of the Mortal Kombat saga; moreover, it features several victory and defeat pictures and an even more crazy final sequence than the intro!

Players can choose their characters from a range of twelve different guys, each distinguished with typical characteristics, which can be edited in the proper menu. Beyond every human conceiving, the game is spangled with lots of mad things, like referee-slaughtering, animals which will appear in the field, VIPs which will perform during the match, and a mysterious tapir named Fart (main character of the game, as you can be able to guess from the introduction) which will perform in a number of funny anims. At the beginning of the match the players will enter the field and choose the field in which play with an incredible money trowing!

Of course, the sporting side of the game is not to be underestimated. You'll always have to win your match! From this point of view, the game is classically structured: pitch type, number of sets to win, type of game (single, double or training), as well as the type of tournament to join; you'll be able to select, in addition to the above-mentioned MK-style tournament, an UNFRIENDLY tournament in which up to eight human players are allowed to take part, or a full season, where player will have to win as much as possible to travel all over the world, and in order to buy weapons and points which will help him in his short career. It's possible to save and subsequently restore your season from disc as well as every change made in the players editing menu, where you're able to change the name, the characteristics and the shirt colour of all the characters... Well, that's all, there's nothing left but wishing you to enjoy Mikro Mortal Tennis! Mikro Mortal Tennis supports all Amiga models with at least 1 Meg of Ram.</desc>

		<desc>This is a game that Activision are not quite sure how to categorise. The fact that it is not easily fitted into a convenient commercial slot is in itself a welcome sign that this is a game completely out of the ordinary.

An asteroid has collided with earth, and the catastrophic damage caused to the planet has made it uninhabitable. Foreseeing such a possibility, Mankind had set up a self-sufficient colony on the moon. Its aim was to seek out useful-looking planets and moons, and using a technique called "terraforming", make them capable of supporting life. Now the race is on to "terraform" the earth itself. But before operations can commence, much research must be carried out, and supplies of minerals unavailable on the moon must somehow be obtained.

The player starts out with the moon base at his disposal. A relatively minor affair, the base runs on batteries, mining what minerals it can. The solar system must be explored using unmanned probes, in order to find those planets which require life-giving elements. But before a probe itself can be built, a greater power source must be assembled first, and this too must be researched before manufacture. Once made, the base's energy supplies can be hooked up to it, and work on the probe can be transferred to the flight bay, prior to launch. When it arrives at its pre-set destination and is landed, the player loses direct contact with it. At this stage, research into the destination planet may be initiated. Later, if thought worthwhile, a craft of a different kind may be sent there, to establish a new colony. The problems in producing them become progressively difficult. More and more power is needed, and worse, a material shortfall of elements not available on the moon shows up.

The mode of play is almost entirely by mouse. A picture of moon base forms a sort of top-level menu, and as the cursor arrow is moved across it, the function of each section is displayed, and can be selected by flicking. Going in deeper, if the research section is selected, a file-type graphic offers research into seven different types of project - energy, transport, weaponry, and so on.

Since research and production take time, not to mention flights, the real-time clock of the game can be advanced by hours or days. Moving around from function to function to sub-option is very slick, with the one exception I found in the controlling of spacecraft. Exit from the control function is clumsy, and the requirement to intervene and auto-lan</desc>

		<desc>Mind Walker is a 1986 computer game written by Bill Williams and published by Commodore as one of the first games for the new Amiga 1000 computer. The player is immersed inside a human brain and must cure a psychosis that is threatening the patient's well-being. Many aspects of the game (including enemies and power-ups) play on this psychological theme. The four player avatars, for instance, are the human bodybuilder, the water nymph, the mysterious wizard, and the alien spriggan.

		<desc>The computer game of an Anna Popkess book (which was originally bundled with the game) uses an interactive fiction System Without A Name, or SWAN for short. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world of guards desperately attempting to retain order over mobs of genetically-mutated thugs, with extensive use of the death penalty. 

Into this maelstrom steps Robin, an 11-year-old psychic beamed forward in time from before the drama. Adjusting to a completely different form of life, Robin must learn to survive and get adequate food, and ultimately infiltrate this vicious police state.

Encounters with other characters are frequent, of whom some retain a semblance of old humanity. Daryl, Alison and Matthew all come in handy, and must be coaxed into doing what you wish. Examining objects often gives few clues, so the detail in the manual is vital, although few of the objects are vastly different from familiar 20th century artifacts. Two levels of object descriptions exist, allowing for faster or more immersive play.</desc>

		<desc>Minskies Furballs is not a port, but a spiritual clone of Puyo Puyo. In a tournament against a cast of crazy characters, you must guide and rotating falling pairs of cats of different colours to make up colour combinations. When four or more cats make contact, they are eliminated, and those above fall down, thereby possibly triggering a chain reaction. Chain reactions will make fish and boulders fall down into your opponent's playfield, blocking his progress. Eliminating blocks will sometimes give you special weapons which can be used to eliminate cats and blocks from the screen.

The game can be played in a two-player mode or against crazy cartoon opponents such as the ugly pie Boo Cake, Hawkings the hawk or the slimy Greebo, who express their mood using both samples and small animations. If you win money in the match, you can gamble in a fruit machine. In two-player mode, each player can have a handicap.</desc>

		<desc>A bomb has been set by terrorists to blow up a sky-scraping hotel in which the FBI's Central Intelligence Unit is located, and you must diffuse it. Reaching the room itself is no easy task, as the hotel is split into segments of 8 floors, and you can't move onto the next one without the emergency key, which the porter has hold of - he must be located. Each of these has one eighth of the secret stop code, and these must be entered in order to finally diffuse the bomb. Secrets can be gleaned from the opposing hijackers, and from the barman. In some cases furniture can be used to your advantage. The whole game is similar to Impossible Mission, requiring lots of logic, puzzle-solving and structured thought.</desc>

		<desc>Khantun is traditionally a peaceful land, with no army or wars. Former leader Kaimen has turned to using his powers for evil, and the land has not withstood his aggression. The Holy Ones have been kidnapped, the land instead ruled by an evil group of monks. It is down to the player to vanquish Kaimen and restore the path of righteousness.

The game combines top-viewed role playing elements with combat action. The player explores the lands, but when encountering unfriendly people the player must fight, using swords or martial arts moves, as well as long-range missiles and magical powers.</desc>

		<desc>Monster Business is influenced by vintage platformers such as Mr. Do and Dig Dug. Bob owns a zoo, but the creatures (monkeys, snakes and all the rest) have gone on the rampage and must be stopped. Its levels contain ledges, ramps, and similar, and scroll vertically. Bob must aim his short range gun at them for long enough to cause them to explode, then release to send them up the screen, and ideally hit them again, to release as many bonus fruits as possible. This must all be done within a time limit - complete it before being told to hurry up and you get a time bonus.</desc>

		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

Mortal Kombat began its life as a 2-player arcade title. It is notable for its use of digitized actors to represent the game's fighters, as well as its use of copious amounts of blood during gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Five Hundred years ago, an ancient and well respected Shaolin fighting tournament, held every 50 years, was corrupted by an evil and elderly sorcerer by the name of Shang Tsung. Shang was accompanied by Prince Goro, a warrior of the Shokan race (a four armed half-human/half-dragon). Knowing that if ten tournaments in a row were won by the Outworld champion, the Earth Realm would be conquered by evil and fall into darkness, Shang entered Goro in the tournament and had him defeat the great Kung Lao. Goro has been reigning supreme as the undefeated fighting champion for five hundred years now. As the last tournament required draws near, Raiden, Thunder God and protector of the Earth Realm, enacts a plan to tip the scales in the humans favor, Seven fighters step into the arena on Shang Tsung's mysterious island: Shaolin warrior Liu Kang, Special Forces operative Sonya Blade, the mercenary thug Kano, fame-seeking actor Johnny Cage, the ice wielding Lin Kuei warrior Sub-Zero and his undead adversary Scorpion, and Raiden himself.

Mortal Kombat is a side-scrolling 1 on 1 fighting game. Fighting is set as one on one kombat, allowing each player to perform a variety of punches, kicks, and special moves in order to defeat their opponent. When the opponent faces their second round loss, the winner can perform a finishing move called a "Fatality" on the loser. The Fatality is a move unique to each fighter that graphically kills the loser in a blood-soaked finale.

		<desc>The Mortal Kombat fighters, plus several new ones, return for a tournament held by the evil Shang Tsung of the Outworld. The action is one-on-one as before, and famed for its high level of violence and blood (other than the sanitised Nintendo version). There are 5 difficulty levels and optional credits, as well as the usual two player mode including same character duels.

To win the main tournament, the player must beat each of the other human players, before taking on Shang Tsung, Kintaro and finally Shao Kahn. Players have a range of punches and kicks available, as well as flying kicks, uppercuts, roundhouses, and the special moves, which vary for each player. These include throws, uppercuts, long-distance bullets, bicycle kicks and a teleport feature.

		<desc>Mortville Manor (French: Le Manoir de Mortevielle) is a point-and-click adventure game developed and published by Lankhor in 1987 on Atari ST. There were several adaptations, amongst other Amstrad CPC, Amiga, IBM PC compatibles. The game was released in French, English and German. Its speech synthesis was a first at the time.

You are J&#xE9;r&#xF4;me Lange, a famous private investigator, involved in the strange events of the Mortville Manor. The game can be solved extremely quickly if you are given the solution. After a French computer magazine published a walkthrough, allowing its readers to solve the game without even having understood the plot, an altered version was published and replaced the original. This new version was completely identical except that at a specific point in the adventure, the player had to correctly answer a series of questions about the game's plot to be allowed to continue further.

The game was written by Bernard Grelaud and Bruno Gourier, with illustrations by Dominique Sablons with Maria-Dolores. Music and voices were provided by Beatrice Langlois and Jean-Luc Langlois. "Le Manoir de Morteveille" was subsequently translated into English (Mick Andon) and German. A version for PC was released in 1988, adapted by Clement Roques.

Mortville Manor was followed by its sequel Maupiti Island, taking place on a tropical island.</desc>

		<desc>Who is MOT ? MOT is nothing less than a 3 meter tall inter-dimensional monster (complete with a tail and horns), which can travel through the planes of time and space as easily as you go from your bedroom to the kitchen.

Moreover, MOT has the bad habits of hiding in your cupboard, smashing all the furniture in your house from time to time or eating all the food in your fridge during the night. And of course, when you tried to explain to your parents that it wasn't you but MOT who crushed their car, they sent you to a psychiatrist.

But MOT is your friend, and you wouldn't let him down when he calls for your help, would you ?</desc>

		<desc>It is the future, and a holocaust has swept over the world.

Now, in a post-apocalyptic environment, you are set to destroy the evil Dr. A Noid, who had turned people to zombies with his artificial food called "SLU".

First, you drive through the city with your ATV, destroying enemy vehicles and avoiding mines and gun turrets. There are several buildings you can explore.

In those buildings, you walk from room to room in a gauntlet-style setting, shooting zombies and avoiding traps. You'll find ammunition, food, and hopefully the pass to the Arena.

The Arena is the third part of the game: This is a deadly destruction derby where you have to steer your ATV through the treacherous maze and destroy all the enemy vehicles by pushing them into the holes in the ground.

After surviving the Arena, you'll proceed to the next city - until you get to face Dr. A Noid himself.</desc>

		<desc>otorbike Madness views downhill racing from an isometric Marble Madness-influenced perspective. You must reach the bottom within the time limit, remaining within the track boundaries and avoiding hazards including water, logs and stationary cars. The faster you complete the course, the more prize money you receive. Repairs to any damage to the bike (incurred by contact with the aforementioned hazards) must be paid for from this, but the rest can be spent on upgrades. The controls are rotational, with the fire button or space used for wheelies.</desc>

		<desc>Basically a remake of the SNES game Super Troll Islands, but superficially incorporating TV character Mr Blobby, who was famous for crushing people and shouting "Blobbitty Blobbitty Blobby" or words to that effect, neither of which he does in the game.

It's essentially a platform game, but the 60 levels are reliant on you colouring in enough of the screen, by walking over it. Power ups are on offer, and the levels include some interesting design features, including ladders, spikes and springs to bounce off.

You can switch between the 3 characters (Mr Blobby, Mrs Blobby and Baby Blobby) at any point, and only lose once all 3 are out of lives. There are plenty of bad guys around, all looking identical and following pre-programmed attack paths.</desc>

The helicopter will fly through four side-view levels, primarily scrolling left to right but with some variant, each of which ends with a boss.

As well as enemies, there are many blocks on the levels. The weapon upgrade system is build into these, which function in two different ways. Most will drop crystals, which if collected are added to a cash total. The others reveal a picture of a weapon with a price - make contact with it while carrying enough credits and the weapon will be bought. When the energy bar runs out the player loses a life. When this happens the player loses all money.</desc>

		<desc>Multi-Player Soccer Manager is a football/soccer management game that allows up to four players to play at the same time. The game has four divisions from Division 1 to Division 4 with 16 teams in each division. Each team is assembled with a squad of up to 16 players. You begin as manager of a Division 4 team which is randomly selected for you when you start the game.

Each season has a 30-game league schedule where you must finish in the top two to gain promotion to the next division. In higher leagues, the bottom two teams are relegated to the lower division. If you finish in the bottom of Division 4 you win the league joker trophy. If your team performs well you may get offered a job at a higher level team during the season. Teams also compete in League Cup and F.A. Cup matches as well where teams of all divisions take part and can play against each other.

Other features in the game include buying and selling players in the transfer market, arranging training for your players and increasing your ground's capacity and safety. If you run out of money, you will be sacked and offered the job of the bottom team of Division 4. If you choose decline the job, the game will end. The same occurs if you choose to resign at any time.</desc>

		<desc>Narc is a 1-2 player game, where your mission is to infiltrate the Mr. Big Corporation, the scourge of the underworld. To do this, you must get through the game's eight stages, with over ten sectors like the junkyard, subway, drug lab, nursery, downtown, Sunset Strip, and even the corporation, where Mr. Big resides. In order to get through the stages, you are required to collect a number of safe cards, and insert them in the slot next to the stage exit. Each sector includes a map, and should be easy to read. For example, the blue or red dots represent you, and the white dots are the missile launchers, while the "E" indicates the exit.</desc>

		<desc>In the 21st century, the world is virtually ruled by the drug barons. Your mission is to equip and position three squads of elite cops on the perimeter, and guide them through the enemy's network of tunnels. Once through you must level the factory with explosives.

The loadout and starting positions are predefined, but you can change the loadout, choosing from two types of ammo, three types of rockets, explosives, first aid kits, transporters, and armor.

The game plays like a strategic third person shooter. You control the commander of the current squad, and can switch between the three. Also, there are computer terminals scattered around that can turn off some of the automated defenses and cameras.</desc>

My mission: find and destroy a nuclear submarine U-5544 that has unbalanced the forces between the two most powerful Earth armies. The name of the operation is Cephalopod and I have heard that you want to help me in this "easy" mission.

At first, we will be sent near the island where is anchored the submarine awaiting orders. We will swim to the coast, and once there... everything will depend on us.

"Navy Moves" is a one-dimensional side scrolling shooter, and the sequel of "Army Moves" and has the same gaming style.</desc>

		<desc>You play a small green guy who needs to blow up eight towers, because their presence is somehow poisoning the water of planets which could potentially be ideal colonies. Unfortunately you need to get to the top of these towers to blow them up.

You make your way up to the top of the tower via walkways around the outside of the towers. You need to jump over, kick, and run from various enemies in your journey to the top. Most vertical movement is achieved by jumping onto moving ledges at the right moment.

The game was considered revolutionary in its time for its graphic technique. As the main character walked around the outside of the tower, the character was fixed in the middle of the screen while the tower itself rotated. This gave it a pseudo-3D effect.

Towers are linked together via a voyage through the sea in your trusty MK.7 submarine. This plays out as a side-scrolling collect-'em-up in which bonus points can be obtained.</desc>

		<desc>This is a sequel to highly rated Nebulus (known as "Tower Toppler" in the US). The gameplay is much the same except this time Pogo must topple the towers and then repair them aswell! Why? Well the storyline this time around is that the evil crime boss known as "The Uncle" has taken the seven Towers of Life (which produce oxygen for their respective planets) ransom!

Because the Galactic Government does not deal with terrorists, they've sent construction worker, Pogo, to deal with the problem. This is where you come in. Pogo must (as before) make it to the top of the seven towers whilst avoiding all the baddies and traps that have been laid there for him. Once he gets to the top, the tower is toppled. Now he must would over 80% of the crumbling platforms to return power back to the tower before he can move on.

There are three new subgames and several new features in Nebulus 2, such as Jumping Boots, Rockets and Magnets (for pulling Pogo up to higher platforms).</desc>

		<desc>Necronom is a side-viewed horizontally-scrolling space shoot 'em up. There are a wide variety of targets to hit or avoid, some stationary, some with programmed attack paths and others with artificial intelligence to close in on you. The graphics have a very metallic look, similar to Cybernoid in a way. There aren't many power-ups on offer and you aren't too dependent on them to be able to survive. However, an auto-fire joystick is strongly recommended.</desc>

		<desc>This racing game is set in the Ramsay Street universe of the Australian soap opera, which was hugely popular in the UK at the time. Nominally you play Scott Robinson, riding his skateboard in races against between one and four fellow characters - Mike Young on another skateboard, Charlene Ramsay in a go-kart, her brother Henry on a lawnmower, and Matt Robinson on a motorcycle. The eight races take in Ramsay Street, the Lassiter's Complex, Erinsborough High School, and Anson's Corner. There are three boards available (two on the Spectrum), trading top speed off against manoeuvrability.

Gameplay involves guiding your craft through a series of gates around a forced-perspective course. There are three levels of hazard presence available - hazards include kangaroos, emus and other (stereotypically Australian) animals, Bouncer the dog, grotty old Mrs. Mangel, and traffic bollards. Contact with any of these costs you time, and popularity (reflected by a Neighbours logo fading out along the bottom of the screen - collecting litter will restore this).</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay was split between a traditional adventure setting, where a player could interact with 'real world' inhabitants within Chiba City, and a 3D grid representation of cyberspace once he'd managed to regain access. Different 'real world' locations led to different grid sectors, thus developing the plot and enriching the immersion.

Cyberspace combat was also simulated in the game as the player attempted to breach ICE (Intrusion Countermeasure Electronics) to gain entry to database nodes and potentially face the formidable AIs (Artificial Intelligences) that hide behind them. 'Combat' with ICE consisted of the ICE and the player doing damage to each other (the former through a built-in attack form, the latter based on what programs the player ran; some programs did one-time damage, some did damage over time for a while, and some had other effects such as slowing down the ICE) until either the ICE 'cracked' or the player was kicked out of cyberspace. Combat with AIs was similar, except that AIs were damaged primarily with skills rather than programs; were invulnerable until hit at least once with a specific skill or program; and the result of 'losing' was character death. Neuromancer was somewhat forgiving of even 'death', as a deceased character would be reanimated for the price of whatever money was in his credit chip at the time of death - although remaining logged into cyberspace at some points required credit payment.

Skills and abilities can be purchased as "skill chips" that can be used in a brain jack implanted in the protagonist's head, giving him an edge in a variety of situations. Skills could also increase with successful completion of a difficult task.

The game also used a code wheel as a form of copy protection. The code wheel was necessary to access the PAX terminals in the game at certain points and without it, the player hits a dead-end in the plot.

Plot[edit]

The game is loosely based on the events of the novel Neuromancer by William Gibson. Locations, characters, items and nuances of cyberspace from the novel appear.

Taking place in the year 2058 in Chiba, Japan, the plot centered on the protagonist attempting to discover the truth behind the mysterious disappearances of his friends as well as other, less friendly cyberspace cowboys. Unfortunately, the player's character has fallen on hard times and has had to pawn his cyberspace deck. He awakes in a plate of Ratz' famous spaghetti, and the first order of business is to find so</desc>

The game itself is indeed a platformer where you have to outrun giants (as in the movie) or push them over ledges. With every level you will be awarded with another advancement in the plot, usually a few pages written on a "book".</desc>

		<desc>New York Warriors is a fun top-down shooter that recalls Quicksilver's Heavy Barrel, although it is much less well-known. As a lone commando, your job is to rescue New York City from various gangs that are wrecking havoc. Each stage takes place in a nondescript New York location, with varied backdrops and excellent attention to detail.

What makes New York Warriors a lot of fun is the variety of enemies and weapons you can pick up and use. The gangs that control each location also have their own attack styles and weapons, and naturally the challenge increases with each location you advance. Another high point is the fact that each mission's objective is different: in some locations, all you have to do is get from point A to B without getting killed, while in others you may be asked to secure a bridge by destroying guarding tanks. The action is furious, and user controls are responsive.

Fans of Cabal and similar commando-type shooters should really enjoy this one, although don't expect it to be a groundbreaking title.</desc>

		<desc>The goal of each level is to safely get Tiki through the level, avoiding enemy fire and spikes, and rescue one of his kiwi friends at the end. The weaponry starts out as arrows, but pickups can change these into bombs, lasers, or bouncing fireballs. These act a little differently, and what is useful depends upon the player's location. A distinctive feature of this game is the ability to ride a variety of flying vehicles, including balloons, blimps, and UFOs. Vehicles can be found ready for use or can be stolen from an enemy.</desc>

The game features four main zones, each with four rounds, the fourth round featuring a boss fight at the end. Other features include the many secret areas and shortcuts hidden throughout the game, accessed using special hidden "warp" portals. On certain later levels, if the player loses their last life due to being killed by a projectile weapon, they will be sent up to a special "Heaven" round. Here, they can either receive a special ending or find the secret route out of Heaven and continue playing the game.</desc>

		<desc>The sequel to Nicky Boom; this time Nicky must find out who has been removing ladders and blocking off caves in his homeland. The gameplay is essentially platform, with multi-directional maze-like levels. Beating the obstructions requires occasional brainwork - hidden ladders are easy enough to uncover, and there are lots of hidden sections to look for. The levels are colourful, and the game has a cute look making it appear suited to younger players. Mirrors are placed around the levels, which transport you to a random place.</desc>

		<desc>Nigel Mansell's first licensed computer game recreates all 16 Formula 1 circuits of the time, viewed from behind the car but with a full cockpit-type view below. This is important because the game is very much a simulation rather than an action game.

Before each race you have to do three qualifying laps, and only make the grid if you are fast enough to meet the pre-defined qualifying limit. The races can be between 5 and 20 laps, or at full length if you prefer - fortunately a half-finished season can be saved to cassette or disk.

F1 cars of this era have turbo boosts, and this is available in the game to provide a quick blast of extra speed, which is useful for overtaking but can cause the turbo or the engine itself to be overstressed, as well as using fuel more quickly (pitstops are for tires but not fuel, again in keeping with the era's real Formula 1 rules).</desc>

		<desc>This is a mixture of action and adventure in a game based off of Clive Barker's movie "Nightbreed" (which is based of Barker's novella Cabal). You play Aaron Boone, the main character from both the book and the movie. Boone is attempting to get to a planet of bliss called Midian. His attempts at gaining acceptable go wrong when he is bitten by a cannibal, and the Police of Earth find Midian and set out to destroy it. Boone must stop them.

The game has several different sequences, most arcade based, trying to bring sequences from the movie to life on the computer screen. There are eight action types from driving to Midian, running from Peloquin the cannibal, or fighting 'The Mask', a serial killer whom Boone is mistaken for.</desc>

To do so, he needs to master a series of top-down mazes. The goal of each level is to find the exit, but it is secured with locked doors and energy barriers. Navigating the maze and finding the means to overcome the doors (finding keys) and barriers (finding switches) is the main challenge of the game, but there are also mines, turrets and patrolling robots. During the course of a level there are optional and needed upgrades to find, e.g. a cannon (initially the tank can't shoot), a mine detector, extra energy or a radar.</desc>

		<desc>A year after the events of the original Ninja Gaiden, a new villain named Ashtar receives word of Jaquio's defeat. Ashtar uses this opportunity to hatch a new plan to plunge the world into darkness. The ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, hits the trail to destroy all manner of vile creatures entering the world while fighting his way to destroy Ashtar, his Dark Sword of Chaos, and whatever else is behind the evil.

Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos is a fast paced, side scrolling action game in the tradition of the original Ninja Gaiden game. Ryu is a ninja who can run, jump, and slash with his ninja sword. He can also attach to vertical walls and climb up and down, which is an ability missing in the previous game. Powerups are hidden everywhere throughout the levels. These powerups include fireballs and ninja stars as before; a unique new powerup is the ninja shadow. Ryu can collect up to 2 ninja shadows that follow his every movement and use the same weapons at the same time that Ryu strikes.

Ninja Gaiden II tells its story through liberal use of cinematic scenes interspersed between the action levels. Different levels feature a variety of environmental interaction; e.g., one level has Ryu on a high mountain where snow is falling fast and the wind is blowing hard. The shifting direction of the snowfall indicates how the wind is blowing and Ryu has to fight against the breeze. In a night level, much of the environment is dark and is illuminated only sporadically by flashes of lightning.</desc>

		<desc>Ninja Spirit is a ninja-based action game that has the player leading Moonlight through numerous enemy-riddled levels on a quest to exact revenge against his father's murderer. To accomplish this task Moonlight is armed with a katana, shurikens, bombs, and a sickle and chain weapon. Each weapon offers its own advantages and must be used at certain times to overcome specific obstacles or opponents. 

The game's coin-op origins are evident in the fact that that the home versions do not have passwords or saves. To compensate for this, however, adjustable difficulty settings were added.</desc>

		<desc>The Ninja Warriors is a one or two player side-scrolling beat-em-up. The Taito coin-op featured three monitor screens side by side, while the Amiga version was developed in letterbox format in order to show as much of the wide screen background graphics as possible. 

The player(s) control robot Ninjas, which battle their way through the levels using Shuriken and knives. As the Ninja's take damage their classic Ninja garb is torn away to reveal robotic limbs, torso or head. When the damage reaches a critical level the Ninja Robot explodes scattering mechanical body parts.

As with The Sales Curve's later title SWIV, The Ninja Warriors uses the company's Dynamic Loading System to load sprites, sound and background graphics from disk on the fly.</desc>

After choosing whether to play with one, two or three (via keyboard) players, the player(s) must select a car and buy accessories at the "pit stop" before proceeding to the race. Three vehicles are available; namely the racing car, sports car, and turbo buggy. Accessories include nitros, high speed, acceleration, traction, fix damage, a change of car, as well as fuel which is imperative to the racing campaign.

The game consists of 32 levels, but the game ends when the fuel is depleted. To prevent this, the player must finish in a high place on most races, which rewards the player with up to 600 gasoline units. In addition, power-ups float around in the levels as well as being placed on the track, but these may be picked up by any of the four cars.

There are four different environments. Starting on city roads, the player advance through forest and desert tracks before playing the last levels in a wasteland terrain. (Evidently, the Nitro story is that the apocalypse occurs, and the races go on. "The end of the world is nigh" is graffitied on the track.) Every four races there are night levels, which means that the screen is pitch-black save for the small area illuminated by headlights. Double headlights are available as a floating power-up.

Obstacles during races are commonplace. Examples are cones and holes in the road, which mainly slow down the player, and (blue) oil spillage which causes the car to spin. The Nitro manual makes reference to pedestrians, and says that in some races extra points are given for hitting pedestrians&#x2014;however During a replay only 1 of the 32 levels has a message prior to entering the race, mentioning: money awarded for hitting pedestrians.

Nitro was also available as part of the Psygnosis monster pack, volume I, along with the original Shadow of the Beast and Infestation. The "monsters" in the game may refer to the players&#x2014;namely, Clint Eastwood (P1&#x2014;white), Rambo (P2&#x2014;yellow), and James Bond (P3&#x2014;red).</desc>

		<desc>The story is told quick enough: in 1990, terrorists capture the world's largest oil reserve and threaten to blow up an atomic bomb if their demands are not met. You are (as always) the only hope of mankind and so on.

Persian Gulf Inferno is a side scrolling action/shooting game. You control your character, who is at first equipped with a handgun and two explosives, around the oil rig, shooting terrorists left &amp; right and trying to disarm the bomb before it goes boom. You can of course aquire more weapons like the SPA-S semi shotgun and machine guns.</desc>

		<desc>It has been two years since the Stellar 7 war. Gir Draxon, the villain, has not been found. Nova 9 has just issued a distress call... Captain John Alex, takes the experimental Raven II tank to investigate the distress call...

Nova 9 is the sequel to Dynamix's Stellar 7, a futuristic "tank" shooter, and features similar gameplay. Played from a first person perspective in the cockpit of your tank, the goal is to destroy all of the various enemies found on nine planets. John Alex's tank, the Raven II, is equipped with various weaponry and a long range scanner to help in the mission. It is also equipped with a cloaking device for emergencies. Additional power-ups such as pickup energy and enhancement modules can be either beamed in or "salvaged" from the enemy wreckage.</desc>

		<desc>The game's introduction includes an homage to Dr. Strangelove. Each player - one human, four computer-controlled - is represented by a caricature of a national leader (the MS-DOS version allowed more than one human player). If there is a computer-controlled winner at the end of the game, that leader is depicted jumping for joy in the middle of a blasted wasteland, crowing "I won! I won!". If the player wins only the high score board is shown. Once a player (computer or human) loses, all of their stockpiled weapons are automatically launched. It's possible for a game to have no winner because of this. If this happens, a cut scene of the earth shattering and exploding is shown, and the high score table appears (though without any new entries).</desc>

		<desc>Obitus is a video game by Psygnosis, released in early 1991 for Amiga, Atari ST and DOS systems. It was also ported for the SNES, by Bullet-Proof Software.

King Cullen passed control of the peaceful land Obitus to his four sons, warning them to stand united or the land would fall into evil hands. To symbolise the unity, the king gave each of his sons a Gem of Tranquility, which when joined conjured a mystical force to protect the land.

Some time after the transfer of power took place, an enchantress named Salome sought to take advantage of the princes' fraternal pact. She told them each in confidence that they must break from the others in order to obtain personal wealth and power. The princes took these words to heart and fought for control of the kingdom. When the battle was over, each prince had one of the gems and one quarter of the land. The power of the gems had been broken. Only by reuniting them in the Tower Obitus can the kingdom be saved.</desc>

		<desc>You play Drak, the last of the Obliterators (genetically enhanced machines bio engineered for otherwise impossible missions.) Your mission is to save the Federation from an alien spacecraft.

Obliterator is an arcade style platform action game. The game screens are static (instead of scrolling, though you can optionally turn on scrolling transitions between screens.) and can be maze like at times with many locations to search. Armed with a variety of weapons, you have to board the alien spacecraft, disable its weapons, plasma drives and shields, then escape.</desc>

		<desc>Odyssey was published by Audiogenic in the later period of the Amiga&#x2019;s commercial life when it was being flooded with Doom clones and the Sony PlayStation had arrived. However, Odyssey harks back to earlier platforming adventure games such as Audiogenic&#x2019;s own Exile.

At its core Odyssey is about visiting islands and getting from one location to another by solving puzzles that prevent progress. These puzzles generally involve switches and doors but some areas are inaccessible to the human character. As the game progresses crystals allow the player to transform into different creatures such as a spider, a grasshopper and various birds and these additional powers open up new areas.

There are six islands with exterior and interior sections as well as a final castle to tackle. Be sure to check out the Amiga Format magazine coverdisk demo which features an exclusive training island.</desc>

		<desc>Society has become ultra-peaceful, but some retain a lust for violence and carnage. Off-shore racing fills that void perfectly in this behind-the-boat racer, which resembles Titus's earlier Fire &amp; Forget.

Four X1 boats armed with missiles tough it out over circuits set up in lakes and lined with rocks, desperately trying to avoid finishing last, as this will eliminate them from future competition. Contact with other boats can also be harmful, and will cost you time.</desc>

		<desc>In One Step Beyond you are Colin Curly, a dog, who loves Quavers (snack). It was a stormy night and Colin was playing his favorite game Pushover. Accidentally, Colin has been digitized and curlified into his computer at the moment he completed the final level of the game. Colin has been trapped inside his own computer and an amazing array of challenges are standing between him and the escape from this electronic nightmare.

You have to move Colin Curly from the ENTRY packet to the EXIT packet by jumping from one platform to the next. Colin can only escape from a level if ALL the platforms have shut before he reaches the exit.

As Colin steps off a platform, it will slide shut behind him, never to open again unless it has special properties. So, it is important to work out the correct route to follow in order to close all the platforms before Colin reaches the EXIT while still being able to move around the level.</desc>

When on offense, the player can rotate to keep away from his rival, take a shot from a distance or move in to the basket for special up-close slam-dunks. When on defense, you can try to take your rival's ball or jump up to block a shot. Particularly good set-ups get a slow-motion replay. You can even smash the glass on the backboard, which will send an irate janitor onto the court to clean up the mess.</desc>

This is a three-stage task, as first you must fight through hordes of fighters simply to reach the castle, and then you have to climb the various sections of the castle, before battling with its existing inhabitant.

The bulk of the game is side-scrolling platform hack 'n' slash action, with mines to avoid on the route. You can collect a number of spells, and select them using the function keys. Your physical and mental energy are measured separately throughout the game, and must both be kept high.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you are a space traveller lost in space. You have to travel to 100 stars (or levels), to collect the necessary components to build a new space-ship, one that is able to get you back to earth.

The game plays a lot like the more well-known Pang. Each level is a single screen, and to complete it, you have to destroy some bouncing asteroids. If you touch one of them, or the time runs out, you lose one life.

Your weapon is some sort of harpoon, that can only shoot straight up. When it hits an asteroid, the asteroid splits into two smaller versions of itself, unless it's already the smallest variant. If that's the case, it finally gets destroyed. When all asteroids are destroyed, you travel to the next star. Repeat this 100 times, and your ship will be completed, and the game is won.

You can also get different bonus-items, such as a gun, time-stoppers, shields making you temporarily invulnerably, and other stuff.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Stealth, also known as James Bond 007: The Stealth Affair in the United States, is an adventure game from Delphine Software International, released in 1990. The game is mainly the work of Paul Cuisset (programming) and Jean Baudlot (sound).

The game was released with the Bond license in the United States, although this led to some inconsistencies as the MI6 agent appeared to be taking his orders from the CIA.

Operation Stealth mainly features a point-and-click style of gameplay reminiscent of many of the LucasArts adventures of the time, as well as a number of more action-oriented elements including an overhead viewed maze section and a scene in which Glames/Bond attempts to escape from an underwater cavern before he runs out of oxygen.

The cracked Amiga version of the game featured a primitive synthesized voice that would perform all the dialogue in the game if 1MB or more RAM was installed. Unfortunately the crack featured a bug which meant that if the player attempted to click the mouse button in order to skip through the speech faster the game would freeze and have to be rebooted. For this reason many seasoned players would actually remove the memory expansion before playing the game for any extended period of time.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.

There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.</desc>

		<desc>The Oriental Games offer skilled martial artists the chance to prove themselves in Kung Fu, Kendo and the relatively brutal Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai., using courage, skill and flare (sic) according to the packaging. It makes for a series of one-on-one fights viewed from the side.

Kendo involves using a stick as your weapon, whereas Kung Fu various punches and kicks and Kyo-Kus-Hin-Kai involves head butts and flying attacks. You can jump over opponents; a quick tap of the fire button turns you around. You have an energy bar with 5 blocks of gradually decreasing colours, which drops when you are hit and increases as you pass time without being hit. Impressive moves earn you bonus Merit Awards.

On the 16-bit versions, there are 3 skill levels (Novice, Professional and Master), digitised sound, and an editor to set up joystick moves. The 8-bit versions lack these niceties, but include an extra discipline, Sumo; these are played in sequence rather than by choice.</desc>

		<desc>Ork tells the story of a young alien military cadet Ku-Kabul, who is beamed town to the surface of Ixion - the planet of trials. Once on the surface, he must complete 5 survival boot camps and become the Legion-Command Officer or die trying.

A sidescrolling action-adventure developed by WJS Design and published by Psygnosis (Shadow of the Beast, Leander), Ork features five expansive levels characteristic of Psygnosis games of the era. While slightly similar to the same firm's earlier Killing Game Show, Ork's presentation is more polished, and the gameplay is less hectic.

In addition to blasting enemies, the player must complete tasks reminiscent of adventure games. Examples including locating and delivering a payment to a gate keeper, finding a specific key to open a door, or locating an orb to deflect lasers.</desc>

		<desc>1994 saw the release of Action game called Ork Attack: The Return on the Amiga systems, created and published by Ian West for free as a Public Domain.

Essentially this is a game in which the player patrols the top of the castle and drops rocks onto the Orkish enemies who are trying to scale the wall. Should an Ork make it to the top then the player can call for their trusty sword and chop of the offending invaders head. What makes this game difficult is that there can only ever be one rock on screen at a time and while the player is holding their sword no new rocks will appear.

Randomly throughout the game a chief Ork will appear. They ascend slower than their companion Orks and can only be killed by dropping a rock on their head. If a chief makes it to the top then it's game over.
Between levels there is a time limited bonus round where the player must sweep defeated Ork bodies into the moat.</desc>

Gameplay is viewed form just above and behind the car. The roads are full of sharp bends and hazards, contact with which can cause the car to roll and lose the player's time. On each section of track there is a fork in the road, allowing the player to choose which direction he or she wishes to go in.

		<desc>In Outzone the player takes control over a support space ship which has to aid a safety unit which has to travel through the dangerous outzones. The 28 levels are basically a big escort mission: in order to to protect the steadily moving ship, the player has to destroy all opposition waiting ahead in the usual shooter way. However, there are also blocks in the way which need to be destroyed by ramming them into each other. When they are destroyed in the correct way, they reveal power ups like new weapons, weapon upgrades, life energy, or shields. In order to keep the ship from crashing into non-destroyable blocks, the player has to connect to the ship and change the direction it steers to. When connected, the players own ship can't shoot.</desc>

		<desc>Overdrive is practically two games in one. First, you have the arcade game, where you have to race against a succession of drivers, each better than the one before, until you reach the final challenge and claim victory. The second game is a time-trials challenge, where you have to race a variety of vehicles over a number of courses against the clock. This is slightly easier than the arcade version and gives you the option to get some practice in.

You have four different cars to control in Overdrive, ranging from a GP to a Super sports car. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, as you would expect. The controls are very responsive, and it goes without saying that it's incredibly playable. What makes it so tough is the speed. Everything just whips along at such a rate that it's often hard to anticipate corners, and you end up careering all over the shop. Overdrive lets you link up two machines via the null modem cable.

Of course, it can't all be good, or it would have got a mark of 100%. The biggest problem is the horrendous loading times. As the levels vary greatly, the game has to load in complete graphics for each race, which can take a lot longer than the race itself in some cases!</desc>

		<desc>It's the end of the world as we know it. What has happened? Global thermonuclear war, another ice age, little green men coming from the planet Zitt? No, it was underarm deodorants! Yes, the CFC gases from smelly aerosols have finally destroyed the ozone layer.

So what do you do? Sit in the sun getting skin cancer? No, instead you drive a super-fast car and are paid to transport dodgy goods from city to city. To liven up the journey other motorists try to ram you off the road or just shoot you! It's just as well there's a shopping centre nearby where you can buy essential stuff like turbos, battering rams, flame bombs, and rockets.

The undulating road's quite good, but other than that the graphics are bland and badly animated with poor collision detection. Complementing them perfectly, the simple roadblasting gameplay will drive you mad with boredom.</desc>

Using a Transnuclear Hypernipple device he beams some fearsome enemies from a parallel dimension, who can see thorough his plan to wreck life as the Oxxonians know it - making them unable to eat their staple food, popcorn gateaus.

In order to fix the situation, the player has to explore mazes, shoot enemies and find food, new weapons, money and tools. Badly all these things are hidden in boxes, of which there are several types. Opening boxes is not very easy: only if three boxes of one kind are standing beside each other, they open. The player can push and pull boxes (like Sokoban).

Energy is decreasing constantly and therefore a constant time pressure is on the player.</desc>

		<desc>P. P. Hammer and his Pneumatic Weapon is a platform game with puzzle elements. It draws obvious influence from the earlier game Lode Runner. In the game, you control a character called P. P. Hammer, who is on a quest to discover and acquire all treasures from a series of more than 60 levels. These levels are divided into four graphical themes: Ancient Rome, Ancient Egypt, Medieval castles, and ice. A fifth theme, LegoLand, appears on bonus levels.

Each level in the game is made up of rectangular blocks, and contains various things including treasures, enemies, locked doors, bonus items and traps. P. P. Hammer carries a jackhammer, which allows him to drill through a block he's standing next to. As in Lode Runner, drilling through more than one layer of blocks requires creating a triangle-shaped cavity more than one block wide, and blocks reappear after a short while. A block reappearing on top of P. P. Hammer kills him.

P. P. Hammer can collect treasures and various power-up potions lying around the level. When he has collected all the treasures, the exit door opens, and going through the exit door completes the level. The player doesn't have to play from the beginning of the game every time; after completing each level a level password is displayed, allowing the player to continue from that point at a later time.

		<desc>P.O.W. is the second light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga similar in style to Operation Wolf. The premise is to rescue a group of trapped US soldiers from hostile territory.

The game takes place in following locations and terrains: jungle, bridge, village, armory, swamp, radio tower, prison camp and beach. Armed with your machine gun and a few rockets you must shoot enemy soldiers and vehicles (tanks, helicopters, submarines) while avoiding the innocent bystanders. You can also shoot bonus icons that include additional ammo and health.

The screen is scrolling sideways and play became faster as the game progress. There are three levels of difficulty and three corresponding maps a player could follow.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Land is a side-scrolling 1-2 player game with a cartoony feel to it. Now equipped with arms, face, and legs, Pac must guide a fairy back to her home in Fairy Land, but this task will not be easy because Inky, Blinky, Pinky, Clyde, and Sue will pursue Pac-Man as he travels through Pac-Land. When he finally transports the fairy back to her home, Pac is given some magic shoes, which will help him get to his own home, where he will be greeted by his family: Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, Chomp Chomp, and Sourpuss.

There are sixteen rounds to complete, with four trips each. During each round, he can grab a power pellet, which cause ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for points. Points are also awarded by collecting fruit that appear, like cherries and strawberries. In some rounds, Pac must use a springboard to jump over a lake. He must also make it to the end of each round before time runs out, otherwise a ghost will chase him.</desc>

		<desc>Pac-Mania is a variation on the game Pac-Man. You need to guide Pac-Man around a maze and eat all of the dots on the board in order to proceed on to the next round. Numerous, multi-colored ghosts also roam the maze trying to stop you. If you eat one of the power pellets in the maze, the ghosts will temporarily turn blue and run from you. Pac-man can earn bonus points by eating the ghosts when they are in this state. The maze is now in 3-D and is larger than screen which will scroll to follow the action. To help get out of tight spots, Pac-Man now has the ability to jump. But be careful, because some of the ghosts have learned this trick as well and you could end up in a mid air collision!</desc>

		<desc>Pacific Islands is the follow-up to Team Yankee and as its name suggests is set in the Pacific Islands, where conflicts demand the intervention of the USA and you, as a crack tank commander. You are in complete control of 16 modern American tanks which are divided into 4 squads.

The objective in each mission is usually to take control of key areas, destroy enemy communications, escort support groups, etc. In a nice touch, missions may be undertaken at any time of the day; night missions surprisingly being the easiest, as the enemy has inferior Infrared imaging to your tanks.

The graphics could be best described as 'functional', they certainly aren't to the standards of other war sims like Gunship 2000, but the functions are well laid out, simple and extremely easy to use.

Overall, Pacific Islands is an improvement over Team Yankee, although interface and dumb AI problems still remain. Once the initial problems of controlling 4 groups of 4 tanks are overcome, the rest of the game is quite easy to get into, and very rewarding. Recommended if you like tank sims, but don't expect it to be very realistic.</desc>

Six years thereafter, the Tokyo based software developer Mitchell Corporation began to update the concept for their next generation arcade machines under the name of Pomping World. Released through arcade giants Capcom and Taito, Pomping World received a very warm welcome in Japan, and the arcade rom was then exported around the world. In the U.S, the game was renamed as Buster Bros; while in the UK, the title was changed (yet again) to Pang.</desc>

This is a traditional, side-scrolling platformer in which the player walks from left to right while avoiding enemies (respectively killing them with the laser gun) and jumping over gaps. Additionally there is the need to hurry because each level has a time limit. There are various extras to collect on the way, e.g. shoes for a higher jump, smart bombs to get rid of multiple enemies at once, extra time or extra lives.</desc>

You should build up sea routes between the 16 cities in the North and Baltic Sea, and your ultimate goal is to be governor of your hometown. For this you need a lot of money and high respectability. The game ends, when you are elected to &#xC4;ltermann&#x2014;the highest rank in this century.

You earn money by buying goods cheap and selling them for higher price. With the profits you can buy new ships (out of 4 different types) or stores. 

There are also pirate battles. For these, you can buy weapons for your ships and go with ships from other traders to hunt the pirates.</desc>

		<desc>The aim of this interactive fiction with graphics is to escape from the land of Kerovnia, where strange occurrences are routine. The Roobikyoub dwarves have been banished from the kingdom, which is not good as they produce high-quality whisky. King Erik is not popular for this decision, as some feel that ale brewers and mineral water bottlers have influenced him. Honest John the trader and Kronos the Magician play a key role in your journey, each offering sub-quests to attempt.

The package includes a novella complete with map and decipherable hints, which are accessed by typing 'hint' followed by the code into the computer. Therefore, those with only a pirated copy would struggle to complete the game.

Your score and the number of locations visited are both displayed in the title bar. The parser allows whole words to be deleted and unaccepted previous entries to be re-edited.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, an evil demon called Satan has spread chaos in the world, and someone has to stop him. This is where you come in. 
Playing as the hero Perseus, you have to go to 5 different worlds, each with its own theme, and kill Satan's guardians (end of level bosses). 
A friendly wizard has also given you a magical flying horse called Pegasus, to help you in your quest.

Each world has 10 levels, and half of them are played flying on Pegasus back, and the other half walking, without your magical horse. When flying, the game plays like a Shoot'em up, but when walking, it's a platform game, and you have to rely on your sword.

You can buy weapon upgrades and other bonuses, if you collect enough diamonds. They can be found spread out all over the levels, and fallen enemies drop them sometimes as well. If your health drops too low, you can also heal yourself by spending some diamonds.

After every world, you get a password, letting you continue from the same place the next time you play. That's fortunate, because this game takes a long time to complete.

		<desc>Penthouse Hot Numbers is basically the same game as the publisher's previous Sexy Droids with new pictures; this time nude photographs from 15 Penthouse models.

Two opponents (the second either human or AI) compete on a 8x8 grid field. The players take turns and each one clicks on a field which has two effects: a part of the photograph is revealed and the player gets positive or negative points; depending on the field's colour. The catch is that one player can move the cursor only horizontally and the other is restricted to vertical movements. The game ends when no more moves are possible and the player with the most points wins.</desc>

		<desc>The story is told quick enough: in 1990, terrorists capture the world's largest oil reserve and threaten to blow up an atomic bomb if their demands are not met. You are (as always) the only hope of mankind and so on.

Persian Gulf Inferno is a side scrolling action/shooting game. You control your character, who is at first equipped with a handgun and two explosives, around the oil rig, shooting terrorists left &amp; right and trying to disarm the bomb before it goes boom. You can of course aquire more weapons like the SPA-S semi shotgun and machine guns</desc>

		<desc>Licensed around former England player Peter Beardsley, this football (soccer) game is viewed side-on. The only playing option is the European Championship tournament of the day, although you can choose the 8 teams from the 26 major European footballing nations of the time (so the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia are all still complete). Two players can compete in these groups, but there's no guarantee of getting straight to a 2-player game, especially as tournaments (and individual matches) can't be quit out of.

The gameplay features variable strength kicks, determined by how long you hold the fire button for. In a break with realistic physics, the ball ricochets back in the direction it came from. Goalkeepers stay on the goal-line rather than using the whole penalty box.</desc>

		<desc>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.

The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.

As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</desc>

		<desc>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. 

Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.

When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear in the game, with one providing tactical advice for each hole.</desc>

Phantasie is a classic role-playing game, and one of the first to introduce a "bank" for storing money in addition to expanding on the classic Wizardry-style gameplay of building your own adventuring party with traveling from town to town via the countryside, overhead views of dungeons, and multiple styles of attack.</desc>

The game's four tables each had a theme, as do most real life pinball &amp; Panchinko machines.

"Ignition", themed around a rocket launch, planets, and space exploration.
"Steel Wheel", themed around steam trains and the Old West.
"Beat Box", themed around the music industry, charts, bands and tours.
"Nightmare", themed around a graveyard, ghosts, demons, nightmares and generally evil things.</desc>

		<desc>After the success of Pinball Dreams on several systems, a sequel featuring four new tables was created. The gameplay is much the same as the first game, with realistic physics, multi-player options and a high score table to aim for. The tables are Partyland, Speed Devils, Billion Dollar Gameshow and Stones 'n' Bones, taking in a funfair, racing cars, a tacky game-show, and a graveyard. Each one has a range of ramps, combos, light sequences and targets to shoot, as well as general themes which are less influenced by real tables than those in Pinball Dreams.

These contain ramps, bonus areas and combo sequences to set up. All the artwork were produced in true 256 colors from the ground up for AGA Amigas and the PC, rather than originating in 32 colors on older Amigas.

New to this version is multiball: Pinball Illusions supports up to six balls simultaneously, in which case it switches to high resolution mode. CD versions use CD audio for music.</desc>

		<desc>Pinball Magic is for one or two players, working through a sequence of twelve tables. Each one has several letters on screen, usually in more than one place. Runnig the ball over each letter opens the exit; pass through this to reach the next screen. Completing a screen gives both players a new set of the 5 balls they start the game with.

Tables look similar to 1950s designs, with 'mushroom' bumpers, points-based targets. A more electronic feel is added by 'black holes' yielding an extra life, a set of bricks to be cleared on one level, and an integrated 'fruit machine' segment on another.

		<desc>Digital Illusions was not involved in the fourth title in 21st Century's pinball series, with this version instead being developed by veteran pinball game producers Spidersoft. 

Four tables are featured: Kick Off centres around soccer/football, Jail Break is set in a prison, Tarantula reflects Spidersoft's name and logo as it features a rampant spider, and Jackpot is based around gambling.

There are sequences of lights to activate, ramps to guide the ball through, and flippers to keep it in play. Multiball can be activated in set ways, to bring a second ball into play. The flippers are not as powerful as in previous games in the series.</desc>

		<desc>The goal of the game is to help Pink Panther guide his sleepwalking employer through his house without waking him up. To help you in this, Panther can use various items, such as a little bell, which he can use to attract the sleeping man.

The game is a sidescrolling adventure and takes mostly place in the house of the employer. Pink Panther can himself move freely in the house, but at the same time he needs to keep his eye on the sleepwalker, so that he can prevent him from stumbling on various objects, such as rugs and tables.

Before each level you can purchase different kind of objects from a store. These items can be used to gently lure the sleeping man in the right path.</desc>

		<desc>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.</desc>

How you acquire stature is up to you; you can make your living through honest trade and the search for hidden treasure, or you can be a little more daring and attack and plunder ships. As you can choose a specific skill to stand out in, the game can vary each time. Sword fighting is played out in side-view action sequences.</desc>

		<desc>The colonization of space goes well, but there are not enough humans to do all the work. So scientists engineered androids which are constructed on one planet. Unfortunately they got infected with a virus and they mutated into monsters. A hero, optically representing a barbarian despite the science-fiction scenario, has to clean this mess up.

The Plague is a traditional shooter of the "run and gun" variety. The player walks through the four side-scrolling levels while shooting everything which moves. There is also bit of platforming and dodging involved: getting hit by enemies result the energy bar to go down which eventually leads to death. The protagonist wields a machine gun which can be upgraded by collecting power ups and makes a big blast when holding the fire button for a time. A limited amount of smart bombs can be used to kill everything on screen. The sprites are relatively big and every level has a boss.</desc>

		<desc>The film Platoon featured a squad of five soldiers on their mission for the US Army in Vietnam. In this action game based around the film, you take control of these five guys in turn, with the chance to switch between them as they each take one of the 3 hits that would kill them.

The game recreates each of the sections of the film, starting with a side-scrolling journey through the jungle, with paths to cross both horizontally and vertically, and the ability to jump or duck hazards. You will need to blow up a bridge and then locate a village, which contains a torch, a map and a trap-door. The enemy has booby-trapped the area and are launching airstrikes, so the danger is not all from enemy ground soldiers.</desc>

		<desc>When this game arrived in it was hard to find any difference, apart from the obvious graphical ones and a bit more speed in the player section, between it and the original.

Your aim in Player Manager 2 Extra is to raise a team from division 2 capable of winning promotion to the Premier League as well as competing in Europe. You are pitted against three other managers who can be either computer or human controlled. These guys are pretty smart too.

The big change in PM2 Extra is that the graphics have all been upgraded. The tactics editor is still brilliant though. If this is your area of interest then PM2E stands out as the best.

All in all, PM2E is a very competent management simulator and if you like the Kick Off series then you'll enjoy the Kick Off playing engine. Though still a solid game it's not that much better than the first version to warrant an upgrade (A1200) unless you're a real fan.</desc>

		<desc>Sonny Bonds is a small town policeman who must fight against the rising tide of drugs in his city. The game is based on real police procedure and adheres carefully to following the rules of police work. Beginning as a patrol officer and working into detectives, Sonny will chase down the infamous Death Angel and put an end to his criminal underworld.

A typical Sierra parser game built with the popular AGI engine, Police Quest differs from the others release by the company in the realism of the setting and travelling, that is done by car, controlled by the player using a overhead view (instead of the cabbie of Leisure Suit Larry or walking around in Space Quest). Some sections of the game require the player to be efficient driving the car (as there are a fair number of chases, and traffic rules also apply to the player).</desc>

		<desc>Little time has passed since the events of Police Quest, when Sonny Bonds climbed the ranks of the Lytton police department and became the key element in the arrest of Jesse Bains, the notorious drug lord. After the trial, Sonny's application to the Homicide division was accepted and proposed to Marie, who had her prostitution charges dropped and started a new life away from the streets. Life was good - until Bains escaped, taking advantage of a low-security prison and an inexperienced correctional officer. Sonny is now in danger from a vengeful Bains and is saddled with his new chain-smoker partner Keith. Sonny goes to the field again to capture Bains, but things are about to get awfully personal...

Using Sierra's new SCI engine, the graphics are more vibrant than in the first game, but gameplay remains basically the same, with the player ordering Sonny to move to a place in the scene (either using the directional keys or the new mouse interface) and a parser interface to interact with the game world. Game sequences are more varied, and include a shooting range, an underwater search or searching the inside of an escape vehicle. The driving sequences are gone, and the player can relax while reading the chatter between Sonny and Keith as they move from location to location. The approach to the game, however, is radically different. While the first (for a large part) is based on street police work, this sequel is oriented into forensics field work such as collecting evidences that link Bains into the happenings of the game.</desc>

		<desc>Sonny Bonds, the sergeant of Lytton police department, thought he could finally enjoy peaceful life with his wife Marie after the drug lord Jessie Bains has been put away for good. However, a series of gruesome murders perpetrated by a sinister cult known as "The Kindred" shocks the city. Marie becomes a victim of their attack and falls into a coma. It becomes Sonny's very personal mission to track down the attackers and make them pay for their crimes.

The Kindred is the third installment of the Police Quest series, its events taking place after those described in The Vengeance. The game brings back some of the elements of the first game, such as a modified version of driving sequences and police procedures unrelated to the main plot the protagonist must go through. Computer work is particularly emphasized, requiring the player to perform tasks such as using facial composite software or figuring out murder patterns by studying a map. Like other Sierra adventures of the time, the game uses an icon-based interface for interaction with the environment.</desc>

		<desc>Pool is a game about pool billiard. There is one opponent to compete against (either controlled by the AI or another player) without further possibilities for customization. The control method is divided into two distinct parts: first the basic position of the cue is set in a top down view. After that the game switches to a first-person perspective where the player can fine-tune the cue to select the spin (the game gives the parameters of the current position). Finally the shot is performed with a mouse click. For both parts the player is on a time limit of about ten seconds each.</desc>

		<desc>Strange happenings are afoot once again in Sweethaven and only Popeye can make it right. In Popeye 2, our spinach lovin' hero must once again rescue Olive Oyl and make mincemeat of Bluto while looking after Swee'Pea, feeding Wimpy and keeping an eye on Jeep.

Popeye has four different levels to traverse through. His initial adventure takes him to a construction site where bouncing springs, falling girders and open welding flames impede his progress. Rolling barrels, and bombs which must be touched to be put out also stand to cause harm. In every level scattered hamburgers must be collected in order for Popeye to get past Wimpy who is often hanging out somewhere near the top of every vertically scrolling platform level. There are also feats of strength that Popeye must perform by beating up a punching robot-type thing with the aid of Spinach. Once past all these obstacles Popeye can move on to the next level.

The second level takes Popeye into the urban jungle where he must climb the side of the Biff Spinach building and avoid the same obstacles as in the previous levels. In the third level falling girders are replaced with giant bananas as Popeye finds himself in a jungle. Coconut throwing monkeys hang from ledges and snoozing tigers and snakes decorate the trees. The fourth and final level of the game finds Popeye climbing the masts of the S.S. Trev and the S.S. Andy as he makes his way to a final confrontation with Bluto and rescue Olive Oyl.

Popeye is able to jump around and occasionally when the situation calls for it punch his way through this vertical platformer. Bonus points are rewarded for finding Swee'Pea and Jeep. He can take multiple hits before he takes a curtain call but thankfully is unharmed by long drops. The player should beware as Popeye has only one life to get through the four levels of this adventure.</desc>

		<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest. To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer. A god's play is just never done.</desc>

		<desc>Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods is a 1991 strategy video game in the Populous series for the Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS-based computers, developed by Bullfrog Productions. Populous II was remade and remastered for the Nintendo DS in 2008. Populous II is a direct sequel to Bullfrog's earlier game Populous and is one of the company's most notable games.

Like its predecessor, Populous II is a god game, where the player is guiding his people in battle against the followers of an enemy god. Whereas Populous only generally alluded to undefined deities, Populous II is specifically set under the backdrop of Greek mythology. The player is a demigod, one of Zeus's countless children with mortal women, and has to battle one Greek deity at a time until finally facing his father. Zeus has promised to let the player into the Pantheon on Olympus if he can survive all the battles.</desc>

		<desc>You play a god, gaming against other gods in a celestial game of conquest. To win, you must help your chosen people take over the world and wipe out the vermin who worship that other god.

Each god starts out with a single human, dumped into the middle of the wilderness. Sometimes there is inhabitable land in sight, sometimes not. To get a chance to win, you must change the landscape, creating flat land for your followers to build on. The more followers you have, the more powerful you will be, so take care of them. Build as fast as you can, because the other god is doing the same.

When you have enough followers, you can make the leader of your people into a hero. He will then go around the land you have built, literally taking strength from the people into himself, and working his way toward the enemy. When he gets there, he will engage in holy warfare upon your enemy's people. He will burn; he will kill. And he won't stop until they're all dead... or he is.

But you don't have to let your people have all the fun; the gods have other tools as well. You can drown your enemies one at a time with your land lowering powers, submerge their towns in swamps, or raise a volcano in the middle of their best farmland. Even better, you can flood the land and drain all the people who didn't build on high ground. 

And when you win, you'll have 500 more worlds to conquer. A god's play is just never done.</desc>

		<desc>Ever wanted to race dune buggies at high speed on a variety of tracks? Power Drift is an arcade racer that gives you the chance to do just that.

There are 5 tracks to choose from, each with 5 stages. The stages range from cities, to deserts to tracks over water. There are also 12 drivers to pick from, from businessmen to skinheads and mohicans.

Your buggy has 2 gears, high and low. Once the light goes green, just keep the pedal to the metal. You&#x2019;ll need to place third or higher to continue to the next stage. Be careful not to bump into other buggies or objects next to the road. While you&#x2019;re buggy can take a pounding, crashing will slow you down.

Finish all 5 stages in a level and you&#x2019;ll be presented with a bonus level.</desc>

		<desc>As one of the four great Gods Apollo, Hermes, Hecate and Aphrodite, choose a team of four mighty warriors to fight for you in the Powerplay tournament to prove who is the greatest. This battle will be fought out not using swords or knives, but with knowledge - gameplay takes the form of a complex quiz on a chess-like board.

You have four playing pieces, which start off arranged as a cross in one corner of the isometrically-viewed board. The squares are split into four different colours, which each represent a particular broad Trivial Pursuit-style subject area. The question has four possible answers, and a correct answer allows you to move your piece one space, perhaps onto one of the four white teleport squares (which randomly places it on one of those four squares).

When a piece lands on the same square as an opposition piece, a challenge ensues, which plays out like a quiz show, with questions asks in quick fire and the first player to answer gaining a point if right and losing one if wrong. The losing piece drops down a skill level.

Once a piece reaches 25 Wisdom Points, it can mutate up a skill level - this makes it harder to beat, but makes the questions it faces harder.</desc>

		<desc>The Power is a puzzle game with similarities to Atomix: The player takes the role of the blob Max who has to collect all hearts divided over the level and then go to his girlfriend Mimi; all within a time limit. However, when Max starts walking into one direction, he only stops when he touches a block. The player also has access to certain blocks of three colours which can be moved with the same rules as Max, but when blocks with a certain colour combination crash against each other (e.g. a moving red onto a green) they vaporize. The game features two playing modes, arcade and tactic, with the basic difference that the arcade mode scrolls and the tactics mode fits each level in one screen.</desc>

		<desc>The Powerdrome racing series is now into its 24th year of high-speed high-octane action. Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine.

There are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games.

Each planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.</desc>

		<desc>Prehistorik is a side-view platform game with a superficial similarity to Chuck Rock. You control a neanderthal who must march through hostile pre-historic environments seeking food and keeping himself safe. Some food can be found in caves, but it mainly exists in living animal forms.

These include fire-breathing Pyro-Tax dragons, the Turtosaurus, and the Bad Bat. Each of these must be clubbed to death, some taking up to 5 hits, and then walked over. Some other enemies are indestructible, with the monkeys who throw coconuts at you particularly fiendish.

You will have to complete the level within the time limit, and avoid contact with these foes. However, bombs and improved weapons can be collected, as can extra lives, time bonuses and an improved jump.</desc>

		<desc>The first game in Gremlin's series of football management games. You start off managing a team in the Conference (the fifth tier of English football) and aim to progress up the leagues, either by improving your existing team or earning jobs at better clubs elsewhere.

The features at your disposal include selecting training regimes, planning tactics for each match based on your opposition's strengths and weaknesses, scouting for new players including youth prospects, and arranging sponsorship and stadium improvements (so as to attract more fans).

The transfer system is a crucial part of the game, as you aim to sign players (who are broadly rated in each of the main skill areas) up against other teams who want them, and sell off players you don't need. You have an overdraft available, but make sure not to exceed it.

The game supports up to 4 players, whose matches all take place at the same time. You can make tactical changes and substitutions mid-match.</desc>

		<desc>In the Premier Manager series you lead a team from the Conference, the fifth division of English football, into the Premier League and onto European glory. Sign the right players and sell the bad ones to improve your squad. As in previous games in the series, the telephone puts you in touch with your staff, such as coaches to improve your players' skills and a scout to find new players. Stadium improvements (room for more supporters, undersoil heating, a better supporters' club) and sponsorship (assigning a brand to each piece of the stands around and above the pitch) are largely unchanged from PM2.

New to this version is the Assistant Manager - if you can sign a quality one, he can do jobs such as training for you. Tactical depth is increased in PM3 - each player can be assigned a position on the pitch depending on which sector the ball is in, in a manner similar to Sensible World of Soccer. Match coverage is fuller than in earlier versions, with an isometrically-viewed pitch displaying each touch in detail, helping you work our why your team lost 5-0, and how to stop it happening again.</desc>

		<desc>Prime Mover is a motorcycle racing action game, viewed from behind the bike. There are twelve riders and five bikes (with different top speeds, acceleration and handling) to choose from. The full championship includes 12 races against a field of seven riders (computer opponents are loosely named after real riders of the day - Rain Wayney and Lucie Kavanora for example). 

Circuits are set around the world, with various weather effects, with a rendition of each national anthem played on the pre-race screen. Handling is loose and arcadey. It is not possible to fall off - contact with hazards or other bikes simply results in you losing time.</desc>

		<desc>While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'tat. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platformer genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.

The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.</desc>

		<desc>If this 'simulator' is to be believed, powerboat racing is a chaotic race across a number of largely one-directional tracks with fjords and inlets forcing you down one of two lanes, and sections where a bridge needs to be cleared by hitting a ramp at the right speed beforehand (as you jump over these, you can land so as to skim off other boats). Your boat is fitted with bombs, which can be placed so as to force the other boats to run over them, gaining you points. Extra bombs and fuel litter the course, often close to the banks, which you must avoid contact with, for fear of crashing your boat. When this happens you are forced into the next one, which is, as if by magic, available at a convenient point just beforehand. A helicopter flies overhead, dropping bombs which you must avoid, and often obscuring your view. The other boats often crowd together attempting to force you into the wall.</desc>

		<desc>Endorsed by famous tennis player, Jimmy Connors, this game offers tournament and single play on multiple court types.

Using crosshairs, aim your ball to the other side of the court and hope you hit where you want. If you are lucky, you might even score an Ace. If not, you will need to be ready to return your opponent's return. Run back and forth as you try to keep hitting the ball over the net until your opponent misses, or you do. When you hit the ball, you will want to attempt changing the direction and speed of the ball to throw your opponent off balance. This is the real challenge of any tennis game.</desc>

		<desc>Projectyle is a single or multiplayer (1 to 3 players) hockey-type sports game of the future. It features smooth-scrolling, frantic action, colorful graphics and digital music.

A total of five goal rooms, arranged in the shape of a cross, are connected with tunnels. The camera smoothly follows the puck/ball (the "projectyle") and scrolls to the adjacent rooms when entering one of the connecting tunnels. Each player, whether computer-controlled or not, has a room in which his own goal is located (their "defense" zone.) A fourth room -- the Frantic Zone -- contains a goalmouth for each player, while the central room, where action begins, allows access to the four other rooms.

The object of the game is for each player to protect their own goal while trying to bring the puck/ball into the other players' rooms to score a goal. Bonuses appear randomly in the rooms, allowing the player who passes on them to gain some benefits, such as freezing the other players for a few seconds, gaining extra stamina, or sealing exits.

The game supports up to 3 player simultaneous quick action single game play, and can support up to 8 players in leagues of varying lengths. League/tournament play supports player/team management, including training, injuries and position reassignment.</desc>

		<desc>ProSoccer 2190 is set in the future in which soccer tournaments are mix between real-life outdoor and indoor soccer. The most important difference to outdoor soccer is that there is no out because the ball bounces back from the indoor walls. The three other changes are the different match division (four quarters  15 minutes), a time-out system and that the athletes wear American Football helmets.

The player takes control of one of 16 fictional teams and, depending on the team's origin, participates in either the American or European league. The winners of each league fight for the championship. During the matches, the player either controls the athlete with the ball when in offense or switches between athletes when in defense. When starting a shot, the game switches to "kick mode" in which the player needs to position the cursor in a box. Depending on the position, this changes the power, swerve and elevation of the shot.

The player also has a few management jobs to take care of, mostly player transfers between seasons and choosing the lineup for the next match. Every athlete has a set of statistics which influence his performance during matches, e.g. the result of duels. After calling a time-out, the player can make a substitution or change the tactical system.</desc>

		<desc>You are a psyborg named Duncan Norton, who must travel through the vortex from a space vessel trapped in a galaxy very far from Earth. An alien race is threatening to take over 38 planets and you've got to stop them. 

Starting from Anacreon, you will mentally pass through the Krypton, Kalgan, Zorgon, Terminus, Trantor, and finally Sol systems. Each stellar system has a certain number of planets, which you will traverse from one to another. 

The game is a first-person virtual reality race, where you run as fast as possible on the tiles that are formed in a pentagonal prism. At the starting point you accelerate, and then change the facets of the prism in order to avoid falling through the gaps. When the tile's path spirals, you may decelerate your velocity. Time runs out, and you must refill your time meter by standing on tiles marked with a "T". Standing on certain tiles that are marked with shapes of different blinking colors will give you a different amount of points. Special actions, such as jumping from one part of prism to another as well as teleporting forward and back, may be performed. Save points are placed on the track but the number of prism facets may change during your run.

Finishing the race to each planet will give you a password, which may be used later to start from this point. The best scores will be written in High Scores table.

The game is available for 1 or 2 players.</desc>

		<desc>Pub Trivia Simulator is a game that attempts to simulate an Arcade Quiz Machine found in public houses. The idea is to move up a pyramid answering questions on various subjects to reach the top so you can attempt another pyramid but for money. Before you start the game you can select how many players (1-4), which question block to load (1-3) and which avatar for your player.

The game costs 10p and you select a square on the bottom row of the pyramid with various categories. When you have selected your question you then move to a new screen and press the start button. The question appears with the choice of three answers and you must answer before a timer reaches zero and if you get it correct you receive points and move back to the pyramid screen. You pick a new question on a new row and one that is touching the square you last answered. If you get it wrong and you are on the bottom row of the first pyramid you can try again but get it wrong at any other time and it is game over. The next player if selected now plays and if you have any money then you can play again after the other players turns.

If you reach the top of the pyramid and answer the question correctly then you move to the money maze. This is another pyramid similar to the first one but now has money hidden on certain squares. If you answer a question correctly with money then it is added to the bank and allows you to carry on if you get any questions wrong. Once all players have finished then the points collected during the game goes towards a high score.</desc>

		<desc>Putty is a platform game where the lead character is... a blob of putty. He has been expelled from Putty Moon by Dazzledaze the wizard and his assistant Dweezil the Cat. Your job is to lead the character round the platform levels making use of his special abilities to rescue and destroy.

When moving, Putty has a natural bounce, and his eyes are loosely attached, moving after his body after falls (as a visual effect). He has many moves available - he can stretch himself to traverse larger gaps between (or move up/down) platforms, unleash a long-range punch, explode (which works like a smart bomb, clearing the screen of enemies) or flatten himself into a puddle on the floor (to absorb anything that walks over him).</desc>

		<desc>In Pyramax, the player takes the role of an explorer on the search of the Thaalian crystal, a priceless artifact from a long extinguished race. This crystal is at the top of a six-level pyramid which naturally has to be conquered first. Each level consists of a number of rooms which have to be solved in a linear order by activating a touchstone. So the player walks through the rooms in a top-down perspective while dodging the enemies - contact causes the life meter to go down and an empty bar results in losing a live. Picking up power ups rewards bonus points, health refreshments, extra lives or smart bombs.</desc>

		<desc>Q-bic is loosely based upon the arcade classic. Fuzzball (AKA Q*Bert) and has been written by Ronald Weeserik. Ronald's no stranger to writing classic games on the Amiga and a few of his smashes are Silkworm, SWIV and Rodland.

The idea is to guide a blobby little sprite around a three dimensional pyramid by hopping from square to square and lighting up all the cubes in the structure. It all sounds very simple, but Ronald has included some devious nasties to compete with your sprite. Bubbles roll down the pyramid from top to bottom, whilst other similarly-shaped creatures may roll down and move from side to side.

Amazingly, Weeserik has chosen to release Q-bic onto the bulletin board circuit, and is not hoping to make any money out of the venture. Game is released as a Coverdisk on CU Amiga disk 41.</desc>

		<desc>Quadralien is a real-time puzzle game in the tradition of Sokoban.

The future: Mankind's space stations throughout the solar system are powered by a huge space reactor, called Astra. Astra is about to break down. The enemy race of Quadraliens has captured the reactor; now, contamination is rising and total failure is imminent. The last chance are six remotely controlled droids, which are to clean Astra and destroy the Quadrailen mother in Astras core.

You're controlling two robots in each of the 19 levels, cleaning up the contamination on your way. Gameplay is a variation of Sokoban: You've got to push spheres in the right direction to clear the way. However, the spheres are magnetically charged, meaning that they repell or attract each other. You've got to consider chain reactions. 

Before entering a level, you may chose which robots to take with you. Each droid has different abilities, like higher range of movement, higher capacity to carry contaminated materials, or a magnetic charge of its own. You can blast your way out of hopeless situations with a limited number of detonators, and you may restart every level with already removed contamination staying removed. However, there's a time limit for the whole game in form of reactor core temperature and energy, so be quick!</desc>

		<desc>Quadrel is a puzzle game in which you must fill each piece of the selected layout with different colored paints, without painting two adjacent pieces the same color.

At the beginning of a game, you can select the desired image or layout, as well as whether you wish to play with unlimited time or not. You can also select the "Imposed" game mode, in which the game points which piece you must fill next. Each layout has a set amount of paint available for use, in four different colors: red, green, blue and yellow. The amount of brush stokes left for each color is indicated on your palette. Some layouts have a large amount of a particular color and a very small amount of another, while other layouts have a more even amount of each color. The goal is to plan well from the start, so as to avoid running out of a particular color that will be needed to finish the layout.

The game can be played in solitaire mode, against the computer, or against another human player on the same screen. There are no sound effects during gameplay, only music. If you manage to finish a layout, you can enter your name in a high score table.</desc>

		<desc>The Quest of Agravain is a platform game where the player controls a medieval knight armed with a sword. The main objective is to reach the exit door at the top of each level. Pressing the fire button makes Lord Agravain thrust his sword forward. Pressing fire while holding down makes him throw a weapon (the default one is a small lance). Like in Ghosts 'N Goblins, when the knight is hit he loses his armor. If he is attacked while semi-nude, he dies. There are several power-ups scattered throughout the 4 sets of levels (a cross paralyzes the enemies, a star gives invulnerability, etc). The game starts with three lives and has no form of saving progress.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, you play a duck and the object of the game is to get the highest score without losing all your lives. This can be achieved by getting all the fruit and gems in the level, or killing off enemies. There are 80 levels to complete and once you complete all of them, the levels are repeated. 

You exit each level by collecting all the gold keys then entering through the door that opens. You have a certain amount of time to complete the level before spikes fall down the level. There are eight areas, all consisting of ten levels. At the end of each area, there is a guardian waiting for you, and again, you have a certain amount of time to defeat them.

You kill enemies by throwing orange-colored eggs at them, and in the earlier levels, they go down in one or two shots, but in later levels, you'll find out that all of them take more than two shots to bring down, so your orange balls would be useless here. The solution is to get a special power-up that will give you chocolate eggs.

Besides gold keys, you can also collect silver keys. This lets you unlock a gate, giving you access to more shots or power-ups. There are also booby traps in the level, such as spikes, and some parts of a level are blocked off by spikes. Get a mushroom and they turn into flowers that you can pick up. Beware, getting another mushroom will make them turn into spikes again. 

Apart from the normal levels, there are challenges where you have to complete a level and get all the fruit as you can under a 20-second time limit. Depending on gameplay, there are also tricks where the last key you have to get flies away and you have to catch it. Other tricks include turning on the lights to see enemies, and running away from the "happy ghost". You'll receive bonus points at the end of the level if you manage to collect every gem in the level.

Qwak can be played as either a one or two player game. The game was released at budget price, and later on a CD double pack with Alien Breed '92.</desc>

		<desc>An eccentric old millionaire stored all his gems and money in odd places around his mansion. When he dies, his widow is unable to find any of this, so she hires master thief Devon Aire to look in the places his criminal mindset suggests it will be stored.

Each room of the house is viewed isometrically, and contains all the features you would expect to find in a large house, from cookers and telephones to pool tables and paintings. Each one can be picked up, pushed, pulled and used, with the diamonds located in intricate and surprising places.

Due to Mr. Croucher's keen interest in experimental science, there are also monsters moving through the rooms. Contact with these reduces some of the energy on one of your 3 lives.</desc>

		<desc>With $100000 in the bank after taking out loans and selling stocks, it's time to start a railroad! Choose from 4 scenarios across two continents with randomly generated resources, and design your own railroad that moves people and goods across the country. Use the revenue to continue expanding, while keeping control of your company and appeasing your stock holders with growth and revenues. Play the stock market with company assets. Drive your competitors out of business with buyouts and rate wars. Multiple types of resources to carry (roughly grouped as slow freight, fast freight, passengers, mail) and convert, own facilities to maximize profit (buy a steel mill and the conversion from iron ore to steel makes money for YOU). Use the latest available technology to your advantage (new locomotives). Your objective is to retire with a huge bonus (based on your company's assets) and become the President or the Prime Minister (depending on which continent). 

The game is essentially a bird's-eye-view real-time strategy game with aspects of building and stock market manipulation. Each fiscal period is 2-years, which corresponds to 1-day of track time. Build different sizes of stations to take care of different local needs, create trains that switch consists at different stations and maximize throughput. Upgrade/retire/modify trains as times change. The faster the trains arrive, the more money they earn. Multiple options will keep you busy as each game is different.</desc>

		<desc>Sequel to Bubble Bobble, Rainbow Islands sees Bub and Bob (in 2 player mode), who are now curiously small boys rather than dinosaurs, attempting to rid the Rainbow Islands of bad guys.

Using the power to cast rainbows, trapping anything underneath, the boys must ascend vertically 4 levels each island, with a big, bad boss at the end of each.

By trapping beasts under your rainbows, then jumping on them to break them you can collect seven different colored gems, and there are also power-ups for extra speed and rainbows.</desc>

		<desc>Rambo's mission is set deep in Afghanistan, in the days when the Soviets occupied it, and America was putting this right (we won't mention who they enlisted to do so). Colonel Trautman has been kidnapped by the Soviets, and you've gone in there to rescuing him. Doing so is a three-part operation approximately following the plot of the film.

In the first part, you explore the building Trautman could be in, through a top-down view of the building. It is heavily protected by infra-red security beams, which when activated unleadsh the enemies. The locations of the beams are only apparent if you collect the special goggles. Other hazards include mines, trapdoors and booby-trapped doors, but there are enhanced weapons to collect.

Section two is identical to the first, except that it is located outside, the enemy are onto you from the start, and there are no traps. The final section changes to an Operation Wolf-style shoot 'em up, with a horde of tanks, foot soldiers and helicopters to face. Your gun can jam, which adds to the challenge of finally getting out alive.</desc>

		<desc>This action game is adapted from the Italian comic book Ranx  New-York by Stefano Tamburini and Tanino Liberatore. Here the player controls Ranx, a cyborg in a cyberpunk-style world. A lethal virus is spreading, and the President has caught it, so Ranx must go to New York with the antidote to save him. After this, he must rescue his girlfriend in Rome.

Ranx will fight with ninjas, homosexuals, the Chinese, and others, using his kicks and punches. Items can be picked up including pieces for later repairs and items which can be sold when talking to other characters. Destroy street lamps to get money, but make sure the police don't see.

		<desc>Red Heat is based on the Walter Hill film of the same name, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Belushi. You take control of Soviet detective Ivan Danko (played by Schwarzenegger), who travels to Chicago in pursuit of the fearsome Georgian drug lord Victor Rosta. 

The game is essentially a side-scrolling beat'em up in the vein of Vigilante. As Danko, you proceed across four levels which follow the movie's original setting, where you are constantly attacked by members of the Cleanheads, a group of drug-dealers who are in business with Victor Rosta. To eliminate hostiles you can either punch them (slow but long-ranged) or head-butt them (close-ranged but faster). The only defensive move available is crouching, so as to avoid being hit - there is no jumping or any other evasive tactics. Occasionally, you can get hold of a handgun and fire six shots at the villains. Other items you can pick up will boost your health, grant you access to bonus levels, or cause you to lose control of Danko for a few seconds.</desc>

		<desc>Red Zone sees Psygnosis attempt to simulate motorcycle racing using 3D polygon graphics, in a similar way to Team Suzuki and No Second Prize. Ten different circuits are featured in the game's championship, although there are no bike setup options. The graphical detail level can be set, which affects the game's running speed and smoothness.

The mouse is used for control, with options to vary the sensitivity of the response as well as the skill of the opposition. The game keeps track of how many times you punted an opponent off, and how many times you endangered one with your riding.</desc>

		<desc>This is the scrolling beat 'em up by Technos which started the Kunio / Nekketsu High series. The original takes takes place in a Japanese city, whereas its western version named Renegade is set on the mean streets of Brooklyn. This conversion later produced unofficial sequels Target: Renegade and Renegade III: The Final Chapter. You must venture through to meet your girlfriend, and then rescue her from her kidnappers. This is split into five levels, taking you through the subway and the docks as well as some inhospitable streets. A wide range of aggressive moves are on offer, including headbutts, kicks, punches and flying kicks. Much of the game's violence is depicted in a fairly tongue-in-cheek style, with an element of attempted humour along the way.</desc>

		<desc>Hoverforce takes place in the year 2050 where enemies known as 'alterants' have taken control of the city by distributing mind controlling drugs. You play with a 3-D view from a hovercraft in an attempt to destroy all alterants and stop the drug runs they make.

The story is slightly different in Resolution 101. This game is set in the USA in the city of Las Envegas. Crime is rife and law enforcement just cannot cope so in 2038 a new law, Resolution 101, was passed which allows convicted felons to be released from jail in return for tracking down and eliminating gangland bosses.

The player takes the role of one of these 'Search and Destroy' criminals. They are given a Theta 4000 ground skimmer armed with a light machine gun and they play their way through a series of increasingly difficult levels. Each level starts with a meeting with the sheriff who names the new target. After that the player is in their skimmer patrolling the streets shooting things, not mind controlled alterants but the drug runner's henchmen and gangland minions (same sprites different names).

The city of Las Envegas is divided into four areas each of which is controlled by a separate drug runner. The during the course of the game's twelve levels the player must defeat each runner three times in order to finally kill them. The runners have minions who will attack the player as they pursue their quest for justice / freedom. As these are destroyed they leave behind cash and drugs that can be collected, the drugs must be collected as evidence.

As a further complication the drug runner only makes a few runs through the city in each level so the player must collect the evidence and shoot them down before the last run is complete, otherwise the sheriff will be displeased and the player will lose a life. Around the city are three shops where the player can upgrade weapons, and repair shields or their skimmer.</desc>

		<desc>Someone is trying to destroy the earth's oceans. As you are an expert on deep-sea diving and underwater combat, it's up to you to stop it. After planning your mission, choosing equipment and healing yourself from your Viceroy mobile base, you must dive into the oceans with your helpful robotic drone RUF and complete a series of 14 missions to save the world. 

There are around 100,000 unique locations to be explored in this 3-D side scrolling game, which is a cross between arcade style action and a role playing game. There are lots of things to explore and experiment with as you travel back to Atlantis. You will meet and question many NPCs throughout the game - talk to them carefully and wisely to gleam key information.</desc>

		<desc>Return to Genesis takes place in the Zephyr system where twelve scientists work on secret projects. Of course every bit of help is appreciated and so every scientist is cloned 50 times for a better productivity. Unfortunately the evil Mechanauts have invaded and the player has the mission to save the scientists and drive the Mechanauts off.

This game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player's main task is to shoot everything in sight - except the scientists of course, which should be picked up. They also can be shot to win the level, but then the player misses out on extra weapons: every scientist (along with his/her clones) has his own piece of equipment which can be activated at any time as long as the scientist is on board. In contrast to many other games of the genre, contact with the environment does no harm but causes the ship to reverse the flying direction at full speed. All in all there are 50 levels with twelve scientists each.</desc>

		<desc>In the 27th century, centuries of peace have allowed great scientific progress in the development of the first interstellar warp drive. Two research ships, designated Explorer-1 and Explorer-2, are outfitted with experimental drives and sent to find new planets for colonization. Only Explorer-2 returns back to Earth. Refitted as a colony vessel, Explorer-2 is once again ready to embark when the peace is disrupted. A planet-wide rebellion stages a coup and overthrows the government. The Explorer-2, crewed by a loyalist space crew, barely escapes and leaves the solar system. Years later, the Explorer-2 arrives damaged at it's destination and a colony is set up, naming it New Earth. After many generations, the colony is self-sufficient enough to develop a mission: Explore nearby space, research new technologies, harvest resources, develop a space fleet and eventually... reconquer and reunify with the Earth.

Reunion is a strategy game where players must manage the resources and development of a colony. From a central command area, players select from among different menus to control different aspects of the colony. Many of these menus also need the appropriate personnel in charge (commanders), whose skills and price tag vary. Typical menus include: The research screen where specific areas are selected, the production/buy menu which turns resources into goods, the colony building menu where construction can be scheduled and the colony's facilities managed, the galactic map where new planets are chosen for a closer look, and eventually colonization. Players can also consult with their commanders or go to "space local", the nearby bar for all the gossip. In order to produce new material, the player has six different minerals to mine and discover on various planets in the solar system.</desc>

		<desc>Revelation is an abstract puzzle game based around cracking codes on safes. Each of the 80-plus levels is a top-down view of an arrangement of locks and dials, which must be aligned so as to unlock each section by having identical colors touching each other. Not all locks can be moved however, and all of this must be done within a time-limit. Your time to collect the gold (by opening each of the 9 doors in sequence in the hope of finding lots of bling) is limited by how long you took to crack the code. There is a bonus game to unlock, as well as extra lives and special power-ups. A password system ensures that a level need only be cleared once.</desc>

		<desc>Rings of Medusa is a strategy game with light role-playing and business simulation elements. Located in a medieval kingdom, the game puts the player in control of the former king's son. Unfortunately, an evil sorceress called Medusa has taken control of the country and is now dominating the people.

The prince's task is to find five magical rings that will give him the power to overthrow the sorceress and claim back his heritage. In the beginning the hero will try to earn money by doing trade between different towns, or try his luck at bounty hunting or at treasure hunts. Once enough money has been earned to maintain a larger army, the prince will send forth his men to search for the rings which are in the possession of large soldier of fortune armies rallying the lands.

Sometimes the player takes part in small arcade sequences like sword fighting and sea fights, or controls an army on the battle field.</desc>

		<desc>In Ringside you can chart your aspiring fighter's progress from untried stripling to awesome killing machine, well, almost, but you can rise up the world ratings by challenging and beating opponents.

There are a fair selection of punches and tactics. The punches themselves are hardly textbook affairs, nor are they aesthetically executed, but they do seem able to bruise your opponent.

Game has better than average graphics and well defined sprites, but a boxing simulation stands or falls on the flexibility of its play. Standing next to someone and thumping them can get very boring. Ringside is reduced to a fairly static and visually unexciting game. Not even the absurd sequence between rounds where you have to wave a towel over your boxer by fiercely woggling the joystick can alter this.

Ringside can be a good laugh either in the one player or in the two player mode. Then again, no-one gets their nose broken.</desc>

		<desc>The year is 2053, and Los Angeles has turned into a grim place ruled by crime and corruption. William 'Blade' Hunter is a private detective who once was a police officer. He is asked to investigate a horrible murder of the mayor's daughter, whose body was mutilated. As Hunter begins to search for clues that would help him solve the crime, he uncovers a conspiracy involving a deadly drug and a powerful criminal syndicate behind it.

Rise of the Dragon is a futuristic first-person adventure game. The game's visuals are reminiscent of a comic book, with digitized photos of actors and hand-painted backgrounds. Unlike most other adventure games of the time, it relies less on inventory puzzles and more on specific choices made by the player. The game has an internal clock and requires the player to plan the protagonist's moves ahead in order to be in the right place at the right time. Dialogues with multiple choices are utilized as a gameplay tool; a wrong choice will often lead to a premature end of the adventure.

There are two side-scrolling action sequences in the game; both can be bypassed without penalty if the player character dies several times in a row. The Sega CD version does not allow the player to skip these sequences. In addition, it uses a different color palette with a greenish tint, and has voice-overs for the dialogues.</desc>

		<desc>Unusually for Electronic Arts in the early 90s, this was a platform -shooter game with little or no adventuring or strategy elements. The game scrolls sideways, and has sections where precision jumps are required, either to clear rivers or collect bonuses. You carry a dagger to deal with the enemies, and must avoid contact with them. When killed, they leave coins to be collected - these are spent in the shop sections. Death loses you most of your coins, but they can usually be retrieved if they land on solid ground - making it better to be killed in combat than by drowning.</desc>

		<desc>Road Rash is an aggressive motorcycle racing game where the player assumes the role of a biker who takes part in a series of illegal races across the U.S.A. Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.

By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.

Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.</desc>

		<desc>The awkwardly-titled Robbeary gives you the opportunity of raiding a 24-floor mega-store of its fruity contents. The game opens with the obligatory irrelevant parallax starfield backing the title screen. A short entertaining sample borrowed from a Pet Shop Boys intro is looped continually until you start the game. If you have read between the lines of the scenario you will not be surprised to hear that Robbeary is a traditional platform game. It would seem that this store is an enormous greengrocer's shop, for almost every bit of floor space is occupied by big juicy pieces of fruit. Collect them all from the current screen to get to the next.

Beartle is a very neatly drawn sprite, as are all the enemies. Everything is large and very colourful, no doubt designed with a younger player in mind, the graphics certainly impress. Sound effects during the game are suitably jolly, though it is a shame the title piece never gets anywhere.

Robbeary is definitely one of the better platform games around the Amiga at the moment (1988), and if you have a younger player in mind it would be an ideal choice.</desc>

		<desc>Robozone is a three-part arcade game, divided into a platform section, a 3D maze section and a horizontally-scrolling shoot-'em-up. Now there's nothing inherently wrong with the multiple-subgames style, but each of the three mini games is as thin and dull as the ones found here.

Everyone here has found the platform sequence tedious within 30 seconds, the middle game is simply atrocious, and the last section, a fairly presentable R-Typeish blaster, is unlikely to be reached by anyone other than the most bloody-minded, making it a bit of a waste of time.

The bottom line: excellent in-game music, but a tired, uneventful and repetitive game that more or less completely fails to provide any decent entertainment whatsoever after the neat front end sequence.</desc>

The game screen is laid out much like a Jeopardy board and players take turns at clicking on a square to reveal a multiple choice question. Get it right and you gain points, get it wrong and it's the next players turn. The game ends when at least 3 of the 4 questions in each category have been answered correctly. The questions revolve around Rock music and cover the 1950's-1980's. He who finishes with the most points wins.</desc>

The game fits the Cinemaware template closely, with a string of action sequences linked by cinematic animation sequences to set the scene. There's also a strategic element, as you move your spies around to gain information and avoid detection, and decide how much Lunarium to use at each stage of the game.

		<desc>The granddaddy of dungeon hack RPGs, Rogue has a long history that dates back to the 1970's. It was first released as a test application for UNIX, and quickly captured the imagination of popularity among system administrators and computer science students. It was such a popular test that enterprising UNIX admins and users distributed it, expanded it, imitated it, and ported it to their home computers.

What is so special about the game that it still attract gamers for over a decade? Many revolutionary features that have become the norm in today's RPGs. Rogue is an  turn-based, single player dungeon crawl. Its attraction lies neither in plot nor puzzles, but in the seemingly endless combinations of features, a wide variety of monsters and loot, and randomly generated dungeon that guarantees infinite replayability. In short, Rogue is to RPGs what Crowther's mainframe Adventure is to adventures: a revolutionary game that spawned a genre.</desc>

		<desc>Roketz is a 360 degree scrolling shooter featuring gravity environment and thrust-and-turn gameplay similar to the likes of Thrust, Virus, and SubSpace. Just like the latter, Roketz is an excellent multiplayer game. The fast paced dogfights guaranteed high levels of adrenaline for countless hours. The game boasts very nice ray-traced graphics and a wide variety of weapons to choose from.

Each battleground has different obstacles: gun turrets, pulsating force fields, etc. And of course, gravitational force constantly drags you down, so you will need both precise piloting skills and reflexes to succeed. The locations are nicely varied, although most of the action takes place in old production facilities rather than open space. Overall, if you enjoy classics like Thrust or Gravity Force, Roketz is well worth your time.</desc>

		<desc>Rome: Pathway to Power is set - as the name implies - in Ancient Rome. You start life as a poor slave in Herculaneum, which, along with Pompeii, was destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius. Eventually you travel to Rome and climb the social ladder, becoming a Captain in the army, a Senator and eventually Emperor of Rome. Four of the game's six levels are adventure style romps, while in the other two levels you control an army in an attempt to conquer an enemy of Rome. 

The game contains many characteristic details to be seen around the levels; from naked people running around the Baths, to buying slaves to fight in the Gladiatorial games. There are instances in which you have the freedom to choose how to deal with various problems.</desc>

		<desc>In this 3D Rotoscoped landscape the player controls Rotox the robot, which is required to to eradicate any form of mechanized existence on each of the levels. Each level is comprised of nine sectors, which are not all linked together. At the beginning of each level you drop in from above and get a general overview of the level. 

Planning a path from sector to sector often involves using moving pathways. The sectors are heavily defended, but weapons can be picked up throughout. When a sector is cleared of robots, the screen flashes and the player is free to move on to the next sector.</desc>

		<desc>Rubicon's plot deals with a catastrophic nuclear accident in Russia. The player must trek through seven levels inhabited by mutated super-intelligent animals in order to diffuse each nuclear reactor.

Gameplay is a Gryzor style flip-screen run'n'gun shooter (with occasional jetpack flights), with fairly unrelenting action. Power-ups are issued by a canister which the player will have to control in order to gain the weapon they want. The difficulty level is pitched high, as with Project X which was released at a similar time.</desc>

		<desc>Ruff Rogers has lost his marbles - in the literal sense of the small round balls used to play a game on drains. He's been armed with a gun to retrieve them from 16 levels of side-scrolling platform shooting.









The gun you start with isn't especially powerful, but various machine guns and flamethrowers can be collected, which make much lighter work of the enemies. Your character can jump and duck responsively, and fire at all angles.

There are 3 different colours of marbles, which a quota to recover from each level. Collecting enough of each particular colour sees all similar ones turned to coins, which can go towards extra lives and points bonuses. Switches are built into the levels; these act as restart points.</desc>

		<desc>Ruff and Reddy have agreed to test Professor Flipnoodles Pocket Rocket. At blast off, something goes terribly wrong and the rocket spins wildly out of control, heading off into deep space.

It crash lands on a planet inhabited by small blue aliens known as Lilli-Punies. Some of these have decided to go exploring on a nearby planet and have become either lost or captured. The Lilli-Punies kidnap Ruff and Reddy and tell them that the only way to regain their freedom is for Ruff to go and rescue all the missing aliens. Without much of a choice the Lilli-Punies take him to the planet where their friends are. Ruff has to search through four areas of the alien planet, beginning on the surface and working his way underground. Each level comprises of various puzzles to solve and varying amounts of Lilli-Punies to find, 20 in all.

Prepare yourself for the wild and wacky adventures that ensue!</desc>

		<desc>Ruffian is a platform adventure played across 17 levels, starring one of the younger videogame characters you'll see. The game scrolls in multiple directions, although you are mostly progressing vertically, with levels designed so that one slip can see you falling a long way - this is similar to Rainbow Islands, but the levels are considerably longer, and it happens right from level one, making it more significant. Hits with the bad guys cause your percentage of energy to deplete. Each level is time-limited, and you get continues as well as lives. There is an surveillance element to positioning, with characters often camouflaging themselves behind backgrounds, and it being possible to use hills to hide, and get to attack creatures that would otherwise be much tougher foes.</desc>

		<desc>Saint and Greavsie is a sports trivia game where one to four players have to answer sport-related questions. Players start by throwing a ball across a series of stadiums. To the left of these stadiums is a green bar, and the higher the green bar, the greater the distance the ball will go. 

Depending on where the ball lands, the player has to answer three types of questions from one of four question packs. Home questions (worth one point) are generally related to modern football and are the easiest to answer. Away questions (worth two points) are generally related to football in the 1960s and '70s with teasers about 'golden oldies'. Finally, derby questions (worth three points) will test your knowledge of football trivia, and these questions are fun as well as factual. Players can choose to answer the question or pass onto the next player. If the player chooses to answer a question correctly, a penalty shootout is given which involves the player kicking a goal to score bonus points.

The winner of the game is declared after all players have completed 21 or 42 matches (when one league season is completed). The winner is the player who has the most points.

		<desc>A simple variation of the classic game of Mahjongg (also known as Shanghai). Each of the 40 levels consist of rows and piles of tiles, patterned with symbols such as butterflies and masks. Pair them up within the time limit to move on a level. The difficulty is that a tile can only be moved if it has no tile on top of it, and a gap either to the left or right (or both). Careful planning ahead is required if all tiles are to be cleared.</desc>

		<desc>Level 9's last adventure game features one of the most unique plots and player character ever seen in a game, even though the puzzles are sometimes bordering on the illogical. You are a police man who returns from beyond the grave as a ghost who has to overcome the troubles of ghost-dom together with your ghost friends in order to solve your final case and avenge your own death.

The game is excellent in every respect, the parser is very powerful and rivals Level 9's own Knight Orc in versatility. Non-player characters are quite memorable, especially your ghost friends who will pour out their hearts on you and keep constant company with incessant stories of how they died. Most puzzles involve pleasing those ghosts so they could help you in return, and are largely fun because you have to think like a real ghost to succeed. Overall, Scapeghost is a great but overlooked Level 9 classic that isn't nearly as good as their best games, but is definitely much better than most other IF games.</desc>

		<desc>This licensed platform games sets you as Scrappy Doo, with the aim of trekking through four levels to rescue Scooby and Shaggy. As his name suggests, Scrappy is adept at using his fists to vanquish many of these foes. The layout of the castle and the route to it features lots of ladders, ledges and gaps to negotiate. Bonus lives (via Scooby Snacks), invincibility periods and extra points (burgers) are on offer throughout the game. Many of these are in precariously-placed areas that require precise timing and considerable risk to reach.

		<desc>Scrabble is a licensed version of the popular Spear's game developed by U.S. Gold Ltd. 

Scrabble is a word game for 2 - 4 players. It is played by forming inter-locking words, cross-word style, on a Scrabble playing board. The Scrabble board is a grid on which there are bonus squares, playing a letter on one of these squares doubles or triples the score for either the letter or the entire word. Players have seven letters, or tiles, each and at the end of each turn they take new letters from a pile, unseen, to replace the letters used.</desc>

		<desc>Deep in the Caribbean lies Melee Island, ruled by the governor Elaine Marley. The cruel pirate LeChuck is deeply in love with her - so deeply that he refuses to accept his own death. As a ghost, he dwells with his undead crew somewhere near the mysterious Monkey Island. Meanwhile, a young fellow named Guybrush Threepwood is determined to become a real pirate. At the Scumm Bar he meets three pirates who tell him he has to complete three difficult tasks in order to be worthy of this title. But as Guybrush is trying to complete these tasks, he encounters the lovely governor, and this meeting changes his life forever. Risking to incur the wrath of LeChuck, Guybrush has to prove his wit is as sharp as his sword, and figure out a way to foil the ghost pirate's plans...

The Secret of Monkey Island is a classic adventure game that utilizes the command verb-based SCUMM interface first introduced in Maniac Mansion: the player constructs commands for Guybrush by selecting an appropriate verb and then combining it with an object or an inventory item. Objects that can be interacted with are highlighted when the player places a cursor over them. The game is the first LucasArts adventure in which it is impossible to get irrevocably stuck; like in Loom, the player character also cannot die. The branching dialogue system, where the player chooses between several available responses during conversations, allows the player to talk to characters in different ways without fearing a wrong choice, and is often used as a humorous device.

The puzzles are predominantly inventory-based; most of the problems in the game are solved by picking up items and combining them with each other or with objects (or people) in the game world. Several tasks are dialogue-based; among those is the humorous "insult swordfighting", which involves Guybrush learning and choosing witty insults while dueling pirates.</desc>

		<desc>Most of the fundamentals of this game work in a similar way to Desert Strike. You pilot a helicopter or a three-barreled tank through 14 increasingly tough multi-phase missions, each of which is preceded by a full briefing and a shopping phase. Before each phase you can enter the shop and upgrade your weaponry, paying with golden medals gathered during previous phases. Your starting weapons are the chain gun and rockets/tank shells. Every weapon has three upgrade levels. After that, you can decide how much ammunition for each weapon you want to load into your vehicle's weapon bays, switch between the tank and the chopper (which can only be done between phases, and some of them don't give you the choice), choose one of the three special weapons and adjust the fuel/armor/speed characteristics. All these preparations are surprisingly complex for a shooter like this, and a bad configuration can make the game really hard (no fuel in the middle of the desert, or a paper-thin armor are just two examples). Missions are set in the desert and jungle as well as over the sea and in snowy regions. Most often your objectives are, obviously, to seek and destroy, while performing some rescue operations and gathering as much powerups as you can. The powerups consist of ammunition, fuel, medals, and others. A scanner is installed into the vehicle to guide you, as is a mapping system and a limited shield. Unusually, the game only scrolls vertically even though you have full directional movement. When you rotate the direction the ground moves underneath you, ensuring a more realistic effect and smartly mimicking motion effects.</desc>

		<desc>Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation.

Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of "No fuss, just fun" could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf.

Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.

Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing. 

The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.</desc>

		<desc>Sensible Soccer is a soccer game similar to the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen, but allowing players to view around half the pitch.

The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.

The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has three star players who are more gifted that the others.</desc>

		<desc>Greatly enhanced version of "Sensible Soccer". Virtually any important soccer league in the world is included in this game, with some countries not only having premier / first division, but 2nd, 3rd, and more divisions. All important international competitions are also included (club- and national-team based). The game has a career mode, where you may play up to 20 seasons as player manager or manager only. During a career as a coach you're not tied to one club / national team, meaning if you're good enough one (or more) big clubs make offers to you to coach their team. This works both ways. [AFAICanProve] All teams featured in this game have "real" players (names, strengths, weaknesses, etc.) from the ~1995 season. The management part of the game allows you to buy any of these players (which number 24,000 in total) if you have enough money (and a free slot in your team, of course).

Besides the player manger career, one may play friendly matches, single season of any competion, and custom competions (can be made from scratch or based on a real one). Teams participating in these competitions can be chosen from any country. All / Any teams may be played by human or computer.

		<desc>A "sequel" of sorts to Sensible Software's 1995 Sensible World of Soccer. Based on the teams that played in Euro '96 tournament, SWOS: European Championship Edition sports new features that make the game even more addictive than SWOS, including the ability to pull off looping headers and curved passes, trial players, international management, and more charming cartoony graphics such as animated crowd and goal celebrations. The game itself remains what SWOS is, and more: a very addictive football game featuring tiny players, top-notch feel of the game, and excellent management options (although that is never the focus of this series) to round things off. Anyone who prefers "realistic" players such as motion-captured 3D models of current football games might be disinclined to try the game, but if you are a real fan of the sport, you will recognize after a few minutes how authentic SWOS: ECE feels, despite its cartoony players. You need to dribble the ball for real in this game - it doesn't "stick" to your foot like in FIFA. This, plus a staggering range of moves and shots you can do, make SWOS ECE much more fun than most other football games in the market. Released right before the 1996 European Championship in England, SWOS: ECE was a great PR move by Sensible Software and a superb game to boot. But since everything in the game would be included and surpassed in the 96/97 edition of SWOS , there is little reason to play this game.

		<desc>The updated Sensible World of Soccer, with more up-to-date-teams and less of the bugs from the previous version.

SWOS is a top down football/management game, with either quick game or 20-year career player-manager options. The games are set to last 3 minutes, but the 20-year career can suck in your entire life for a few months. The graphics are kept very small so the player can orientate themselves on the pitch without need for a radar. The controls are simple, easy to get used to and very effective. In the full career mode you can jump from club-to-club buying any of the game's 29000+ players, as well as play around with team tactics.

And you can choose from 1400 teams over the five continents.

		<desc>Undoubtedly the best game in the venerable Sensible Soccer series, Sensible World of Soccer 96/97 is the last annual update by Sensible Software.
SWOS 96/97 basically upgrades the earlier version, SWOS 95/96 Euro '96 Edition, with 1997 teams from around the world. Innovations from the previous version (SWOS 95/96) includes bendy passes, looping headers, more international teams, and even bells &amp; whistles such as crowd animation. The hallmark of the series has been spotless playability and the sheer adrenaline rush of controlling tiny players from a top-down view, and SWOS 96/97 takes the fun to new heights with smoother animations and even more coaching options such as trial players and international management, one of the best new features. International management essentially means that after at least 3 consecutive successful seasons as a club's manager, you can be offered a chance to manage your national team in international tournaments, such as the World Cup or European Championship. You can actually manage any other nation if you don't select a nationality at the start. This feature is a lot of fun, and greatly extends the game's longevity. The career mode also sees some tweaks that make the game longer and more realistic. There are also numerous little additions that make the game a lot more user-friendly, such as flashing the name of a player who has control of the ball on screen, so you can tell the little players apart.
If you love soccer, this is THE soccer game to own. It may not have the realistic ball handling of Dino Dini's Goal! or complex simulation options of Championship Manager, but for sheer playability and joy of on-the-pitch action, SWOS 96/97 is the only game in town.</desc>

		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories. As the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes his father's face. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platformer. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>Using the same graphical interface as Deja Vu, Shadowgate is an adventure game set in a fantasy world. Players take the part of an adventurer sent to the ancient keep of Shadowgate on a quest to find a mystic artifact known as the Staff of Ages and stop the evil Warlock Lord from summoning a horrific demon known as the Behemoth. However, Shadowgate has become infested with the Warlock Lord's demonic minions, not to mention the castle's still functional booby-traps. 

Unlike Deja Vu, death comes at the protagonist suddenly, unexpectedly and, most of all, often. Such simple acts as pulling the wrong switch or opening the wrong door can cause the hero to be skewered by a booby-trap or disemboweled by a monster. If the player character's torch burns out (this happens quite regularly) and the player forgets to light a new one, the protagonist will trip in the dark and break his neck.</desc>

		<desc>Operation Wolf and The Untouchables combine for this action game set in 1920s Chicago. You play Lieutenant Sharkey, who has been sent out to wipe out Rubbers Malone and his henchmen.

You have control over the gun, which you move across the screen as the game scrolls steadily from left to right, and must kill as many of the henchmen as you can - otherwise they will shoot at you and reduce your energy level. You are armed with a limited amount of ammo plus a few Molotov Cocktails to throw - both of these can be replenished from bonus items. As well as on the streets, enemies also appear in cars and through windows (there's a special bonus for shooting these). At the end of each level you meet an informant, who must not be shot, as this destroys the entire level of work.</desc>

		<desc>Shuffle is a successor to Atomix and offers the same playing principle: the player has to construct a molecule by combining atoms. Those atoms are spread out over the top-down playfield and can be moved by walking into them with the player character. Once nudged, the atoms don't stop until they meet a wall or another obstacle. All this has to be achieved within a time limit. Also included is the two-player mode known from the predecessor: both players work at the same puzzle, but only the one who finished it gets the points. The players take turns of ten seconds.

The main addition to the gameplay mechanics are power ups which can be collected in the levels, e.g. extra time, bonus points or a level skip. The game features 30 regular levels and all five levels the player has the opportunity to improve the high score by playing a bonus level. In addition there are 35 levels which are designed for advanced players.</desc>

		<desc>Shuttle is a vastly underrated and undersold simulation, probably because it is a hard SCI-FI game with a steep learning curve. This is the perfect game for would-be astronauts. It's a very realistic (and the only decent) simulation of the Space Shuttle. This one should not be approached by casual gamers, as this game is rock-hard. The flight model is very good, and it the glide test, the shuttle really handles like the enormous winged brick it is. Avionics are very detailed, and you should get a proper manual to get to use this game effectively.

The manual accurately describes the launch and mission procedures, and unless you happen to work on the space shuttle program, you'll very likely need it. Graphics are very good for the time, sporting good old polygons. Sound is somewhat limited, but decent.

This is a great game that has never really had a sequel, but one really needs to persist with it. Definitively recommended.</desc>

		<desc>The legendary game of the Civilization series, it defined a new genre of turn based strategy.

When Sid Meier's Civilization was released in 1991, it changed the strategy video game market forever. Its format has since been copied by a number of 'turn-based' games, and the basic plot of the game was to build an empire. Once this had been successfully established, the aim of the game was to get your civilization to grow and flourish.

The game itself covered a wide period of history, stretching from the prehistoric ages to the futuristic development of Outer Space. This included an in-depth look into the Ancient Greeks, as well as detailed game play that covered the Roman Empire. This variety of content was enough to keep players hooked on this gaming classic for countless hours - the publisher was also ultimately responsible for the Sim City series of games across a number of different platforms.</desc>

		<desc>As special agent Maximilian (or Maxine) "Max" Remington, you are the premier anti-terror agent in the world. CIA have received tips and clues about some suspicious activities of some known bad guys. Gather enough evidence through house search, wiretaps, etc. Decode any messages you discover to unravel additional clues. Each operation will be handled by multiple people. Figure out the crime before it happens and get enough evidence to find the true mastermind behind the whole thing. Then chase down and arrest the suspects via car chases or go into the house arrest the suspect yourself. Can you arrest all the masterminds? 

Covert Action is best described as a secret agent simulator, with a heavy dose of puzzle and some top-down shooter action. You'll follow the hints all over the world, surveil suspect safehouses, apply wiretaps (which is a puzzle sequence), even go inside and check each and every drawer without arousing suspicion (by keeping very quiet). If you're discovered, you'll need to avoid car chases or you'll end up shooting it out with the bad guys. You can also "tail" a suspect (with multiple cars) and see if you can find another safehouse or more headquarters to search for clues. You have a silenced pistol (or Uzi) and three different types of grenades, plus other high-tech toys. As you get closer to the mastermind, the plot gets more intricate, timeline gets shorter, code breaking is tougher, and enemies harder to take out.</desc>

		<desc>This is the third light-gun game for the Commodore Amiga.  It is a collection of eight arcade-style games that take place at a carnival.  The scenario is that the player arrives at the carnival and has tokens to play the various mini-games.  These mini-games include shooting balloons, throwing knives at a clown, the water dunk tank, the haunted hill, shooting balls, a hammer strength test, and the clock shoppe.

This was one of the first video games that allowed players to import their own images and place themselves inside the game (referred to as &#x2018;InterActor&#x2019; on the game box).

		<desc>Football fever hots up some more as Sierra release their own entry into the computer game World Cup, and it's a very competent and extremely playable arcade soccer game it is one of the most instantly playable arcade football engines yet seen.

Let's begin at the beginning. You can either play as a team in the official World Cup draw, or take part in a random one. Up to eight people can play at once, each selecting a team and playing through their respective groups until victory or rejection. Playing a game is incredibly easy, far easier than the Kick Offs and Sensible Soccers of this world. The reason being that there are none of the combinations and strange joystick positions of those games. Have no fear, as Sierra Soccer is just as addictive and just as much fun. Whether you have an A500 or an A1200, you'll be amazed at the spectacular animation of the players on the pitch. Over 4000 frames of animation have the players running, jumping, sliding, falling face down and there's even a fully mobile referee, complete with working whistle. A1200 owners get the benefit of a full 3D crowd too!

It may not have a big licence behind it, but Sierra Soccer is still great fun to play, and well worth adding to any collection.</desc>

		<desc>You are now a member of the Silent Service, the US Navy Submarine command. For a long while after Pearl Harbor, you are the only forces capable of striking back at the Japanese in the Pacific. Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand. Set your difficulty/realism level and time period (early means less tech for juicier targets, later means tougher escorts, more tech, lousier targets). Contend with factors like dud torpedoes, maximum depth, and more.

You can choose among practice run against some old hulks, recreate historical convoy attacks, go on a single patrol, or go on your own campaign, which lets you go multiple patrols until you die, get promoted, or survive the war.</desc>

		<desc>Silkworm is a classic horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up. The main difference between this game and many other side-scrolling shoot-em-ups is that you will be on land as well as in the air.

The first player would play as a helicopter, but if a second player joins the game, they would play as a jeep. Both players would have to protect each other as well as themselves. After a certain number of kills, a "goose" helicopter would form on the screen. If the players managed to destroy it they would get a weapon's powerup. This would go on throughout the entire game, and a "goose" could appear even during the fight with the end-of-level baddie.</desc>

		<desc>Sim Earth puts you in charge of an entire planet throughout its 10 billion year lifespan. Your ultimate task is to guide the planet's inhabitants into the stars, from its humble single-celled roots.

The main threats you face include pollution, disease, famine, war and global warming. The controls available to you include the chance to move mountains and continents, creating different levels of species, and unleash tidal waves and earthquakes so as to reshape your planet. All of these things take from your limited energy, which must be replenished.</desc>

		<desc>The A500/A600/500+ version was released around the same time as Sim Life AGA, the drop in speed was minimal and you was able to create the smaller two worlds. Apart from that, the two games are playing in the same manner.

While earlier Maxis games involved developing ant colonies, buildings or planets, Sim Life is directed at creating and sustaining plants and animals. As in previous Maxis titles, Sim Life features both a macro and micro approach to its subject matter. Not only will you be challenged to build an ecosystem by adjusting such variables as climate, physics, time, and elevation, but you can also create new species by either splicing genes or mixing three different parts from existing animals or plants. Creatures will evolve and mutate over time, interact with others, and may even become extinct due to environmental changes. Choose from six preset scenarios, a built-in tutorial, and an option to play an experimental or freeform game.

Sim Life does everything it claims to do, and although it's extremely technical, it never baffles the user with jargon. Its only real downfall is, of course, the fact that only a small percentage of users will fully appreciate what it can do.</desc>

		<desc>Sim Life AGA is the fourth game in Maxis's famous Sim series, after the excellent Sim City and Sim Earth and the okay-ish Sim Ant.

The basic concept of Sim Life AGA is to indeed simulate life. You've got a large world map made of rectangular blocks. You can then populate this world map with tens, even hundreds of animals and plants, and see how they live their entire lives in front of your eyes. Sounds boring? It might be, if that was all there is. But Sim Life also simulates evolution and mutations, so the lifeforms' genome changes as time goes by. As well as that, you can make up your own lifeforms.

In practice, Sim Life AGA is not that exciting. It will be completely boring to all except a select few biology-buffs. The graphics look nice, but are hardly spectacular. Game comes in two versions, AGA and non-AGA, but they don't look all that different. Sound effects are plentiful, but simple. They are too generic to give the illusion that your animals are actually communicating, and
just serve as reminders.

If you like games that have you on the edge of your seat, trying hard to achieve a result, don't download Sim Life, it will fail to deliver your expectations.</desc>

		<desc>If you've ever suffered through an ant infestation problem or been besieged by the little critters on a family picnic, then SimAnt will probably strike a nerve.

SimAnt at heart is a simple game and doesn't have all the glittery action of adventure and action games but it is, after all, a simulation. What it does have is a great deal of integrity, intrigue and interaction and provides literally hours of immersive game play. The interface, as in most Maxis games, is intuitive and very easy to use. Graphics are what you might expect from an ant simulation, fairly simple in appearance but detailed enough to allow meaningful text, charts and graphs to enhance control. Sound effects are very well done and, in fact, can be toggled off if you don't like the sounds of ant carnage before breakfast.

SimAnt has an amazing amount of strategy involved in managing the survival skills. With a great interface and easy game control system, it's a breeze to play. Various modes offer depth of game play. Replay value depends on how much effort you want to put into managing a virtual ant colony.</desc>

		<desc>The Simulcra unit was thought to be the last best hope for peace. International disputes could be battled out in a simulated environment, in a world with no real guns or bombs. Unfortunately, the system malfunctioned and began generating real weapons and tanks to attack the outside world.

You are the man charged with putting a stop to all of this. In your ground-skimming SRV, remove the power lines that keep Simulcra functional. Shoot out each of the energy projectors which block your path to clear each of the 30 matrices.

The action is viewed from immediately behind you, showing a world of pathways and gaps which rotate as you move your craft, which can also reverse. You will have to fight off guns, planes and everything else the embattled system can throw at you. Destroying these releases pods which give extras such as improved weaponry and extra energy when collected. A full map of the area is provided.</desc>

		<desc>The story is that the Caliph has been turned into a Falcon by his enemies. Now cue Sinbad the super hero with his mission to save the kingdom. Sinbad now assumes command of the armies and navy of Damaron. The answer to most questions can only be found beyond the shores of Damaron. Therefore, you set sail aboard your ship, the Sabarlus, with your loyal crew. Like the legends of Sinbad, you encounter many adventures as you navigate foreign seas in your search for truth. Not all adventures will occur at sea, and when on land you must guard your anchored ship when venturing out. Failure to do so could result in the seizure of ship by sea pirates. As in the legends of Sinbad you must defeat the dreaded Pteranoxos and the Cyclops. You must also find the Gypsy and follow her advice. If you're lucky, the Genie will aid you in your endeavour. And occasionally, you must cross swords with the Black Prince and others.</desc>

		<desc>Fight as either Red Beard or One Eye through various pirate themed levels, like ships and forts, and even some non-pirate themed levels, battling ninjas, skeletons, and others in a quest to get back your hard earned money from an evil wizard. You can also fight side by side with a friend (who controls the pirate you didn't choose).

Fighting works like fencing, with a few different moves to use, including parrying. The levels scroll through with a boss at the end of each. You gain money by vanquishing foes and digging for treasure where X marks the spot.

		<desc>As the ruthless Slayer you have hordes of enemies to wipe out in this horizontally-scrolling shooter. The paths are narrow and treacherous in a similar way to Scramble, so shooting out the wall-mounted installations is important. There are plenty of bonus weapons and shields available however, and 5 lives in total. Each of the 3 levels ends with a boss to defeat.</desc>

		<desc>Normally this type of deep and involved adventure game is just my cup of tea, especially if it is in a 3-D world vein. Sleeping Gods Lie though is an odd game. The puzzles are in there just waiting to be found and the game has considerable depth but to its detriment there is a heck of a lot of wandering around vast, barren terrain as well. The slow moving pace put me off initially but once I got down to some serious mapping it became quite a compelling adventure romp. The accompanying sound effects are surprisingly poor but the title screen music has a certain charm. Sprite expansion is well implemented but I found the character animation and movement occasionally a bit messy to look at. In short, a little long-winded but enjoyable all the same.</desc>

		<desc>Slightly Magic is a platformer-adventure game not unlike Codemasters' own Dizzy and Seymour series, but is generally shorter and easier than most other games of that genre.

In Slightly Magic you are cast as Slightly - mischievous nephew of legendary wizard Bigwiz, who has suddenly taken off on some urgent business, leaving his castle in disarray with dragons and magical spells running amok. One of the dragons kidnaps the princess, and now Slightly has to save her.

In addition to standard inventory puzzles of Dizzy games, Slightly Magic introduces a magic system that requires multiple objects to be combined in order to achieve effects ranging from frightening the enemies to turning the player into a fish.

&amp;gt;offering the ultimate prize... Your life! Sure, you can win toasters

&amp;gt;storyline... THIS IS SHOWBIZ AT ITS HOTTEST!!!
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;
















































***Smash TV***, known as Super Smash TV on some other versions, is a 1990
arcade game created by Eugene Jarvis and Mark Turmell for Williams. It is
 a run and gun game in the same vein as its predecessor, Robotron: 2084 
(also produced by Jarvis). As in the previous game, players battle waves 
of enemies by using guns; the arcade version even uses the two-joystick 
control system of Robotron. The plot of Smash TV revolves around a 
futuristic game show in which players compete for various prizes, as 
well as their lives.
















Home versions were developed for various platforms, most of which were 
published by Acclaim Entertainment.
















***Gameplay***
















The play mechanic is very similar to that of Eugene Jarvis' earlier 
Robotron: 2084, with dual-joystick controls and series of single screen 
areas. The theme of the game, borrowed from The Running Man, involves 
players competing in a violent game show, set in the then future year of 
1999. Moving from one room to the next within the studio/arena, players 
have to shoot down hordes of enemies as they advance from all sides, 
while at the same time collecting weapons, power-up items, and 
assorted bonus prizes until a final show down with the show's host 
where players are finally granted their prizes, life and freedom. 
Among the game's items are keys - if enough keys are collected, 
players can access a bonus level called the Pleasure Dome.

		<desc>If there was ever a game that could win an award for being the most sponsored in the software industry, this would have to be it. Not only is The Sun newspaper behind it, but so are Fizzy Chewits and Domino Pizzas. It's a shame they had to sponsor such a terrible game. No, scratch that, Snapperazzi is staggeringly terrible.

You play the Snapper, a small but willing photographer who wants to get into the world of the paparazzi. To prove his worth to The Sun editor, he has to race around some large, jerky levels, taking pictures of some of the most misshapen sprites ever seen, while collecting rolls of film and trying to avoid bills, shops and anything else that might try to takes his money. He also needs to collect enough delicious Domino pizzas, so he can then build a space ship to take him to the next level.

I'm sorry, but this is really a dreadful game. The joystick controls are sticky and wooden feeling, the sound effects are drab and basic, and the garish use of background colours gives the game a very confused look. I can't think of anything positive about this game at all. Even the box front looks like it was thrown together in the dark.</desc>

		<desc>A conversion of the cult fave arcade rave. It's effectively Bubble Bobbie in a snowy clime but with a few appropriate twists and some neat cartoon visuals. It looks and plays identically to its arcade parent - well, save for the absence of the simultaneous two player option (it wasn't implemented because the action would have slowed down from the ideal running speed). Although scheduled for release in mid-1991 and completed, the Amiga conversion was never published. Later, the game was rediscovered and released for free.</desc>

		<desc>You must fly an F14-LBC "Rapier" on a series of missions all along Colombia. You've land missions like free flight, destroy drug labs, bomb drug refineries, destroy drug stores and destroy drug convoy. You've aircraft carrier missions like free flight, destroy enemy aircraft carriers, destroy drug ships and destroy enemy oil supplies. In the air you can fight the MiG-27, Su-27, MiG-29 and MiG-31 armed with heat or radar guided missiles!

You can choose to be an existing pilot or to create a new one. You can choose between 2 levels of difficulty: beginner (less enemy attacks) or expert (the most dangerous). The weather will affect the mission. The good weather will be great for training, and the stormy will be dangerous but great for attacks, as you can hide into the clouds and approach the enemy unnoticed. You'll have a copilot that will help you telling what's going on every moment. You can avoid missiles using your skills, using chaff or... if you can't, you can use your parachute!</desc>

		<desc>Aliens attempting to steal the World Cup have crashed as they tried to flee, and the Cup has been broken, its pieces scattered around the globe. As Soccer Kid, you must retrieve it. During your journey you will visit Britain, Italy, Russia, Japan, and finally the States.

Soccer Kid is a platform game with some unique elements. As the name implies, you have to kill your enemies with your ball. Football-style tricks of keeping the ball in the air and under control are especially useful - headers and overhead kicks can be played with practice. You gain access to the pieces by collecting 11 Player Cards across each world.

There is a saving feature that gives you the ability to save between each country (but not between individual levels).</desc>

		<desc>SOLID GOLD is a freeware (in electronic form) Jump'n Run with 8-way soft scrolling. It's written for the classic Amiga hardware and designed in the style of the early 90s.

You are John Kayle, an adventurer and archeologist, trying to recover important artefacts in four different places of the world, competing with a mysterious secret society.

The game features ten levels spanning four worlds, with different graphics and enemies. Each level's goal is to find an artefact which will lead the  way to the next world. Most enemies can be killed by jumping onto them. It is important to hit them from above. Touching an enemy's side or contact from below are lethal for the hero. After collecting 50 gems of any kind you will be granted an extra life. Each level is concluded by a statistics screen. It will display the number of collected items and killed enemies, opposed to total numbers. Upon reaching the maximum possible numbers, an extra bonus is granted.</desc>

		<desc>Son Shu Shi is a game that nearly never was. Although released on the Atari ST, the Amiga version was previewed and reviewed in magazines but never appeared. The authors completed the Amiga version, but no longer have a copy of the source code or binary. However, a friend had still retained a working version.

The evil demon Taar-Ka has occupied the lovely kingdom of Tan Tao, which is why Son Shu-Shi is now allowed to act as a savior in the emergency. Technically very well balanced game, very colourful with beautiful background. The sound effects are clear and crisp and music is everywhere.

This is a brilliant platformer. Gameplay is no slouch and helps to make it thoroughly entertaining with fast and frantic playability. So beautiful and very addictive. Now I  need one more go.</desc>

		<desc>Sorcerer Lord is a medieval fantasy game of tactical warfare.

The evil Shadowlord's army is threatening to overrun the peaceful country of Galanor. The alliance of races in Galanor isn't very fond of suppression, slavery or extinction, so they are preparing for war -- it's your job to coordinate the Galanorian defense.

Movement and combat are turn-based. You and the Shadowlord alternately recruit new troops, move armies on a 2D hex-map of the land and try to conquer the enemies garrisons. The outcome of fights is shown as plain text only. Although the gameplay is quite simple, there are a few tactical knacks like certain races fighting more fiercely in certain terrain types, fatigue levels and basic statistics for army leaders. Despite the game's title, magic is a rather unimportant element of chance in battles and not under your direct control.

The game contains a time limit; you've got 40 turns in easy level, less in advanced levels.</desc>

		<desc>Actual Screenshots' game, Sorceror's Apprentice, places you in the part of wisened old man blessed with the King's magic powers. The reason for this gilt is because the King wants you to free the land from the forces of darkness.

I must admit to finding the gameplay of Sorceror's Apprentice somewhat tiresome and monotonous albeit playable. The first few credits kept me addicted so that I could progress to allow me to see later levels, but I soon saw it was a case of seen it, done it. The graphics are far superior to the sound, although I still wasn't satisfied with what should be up to sixteen-bit standard.

In terms of graphics, Sprites are nicely drawn that jump and move fairly smoothly across bland and simplistic backdrops. The explosions are rather poor, and the overall effect is polished but could be hotter. Sounds are slightly worst than the graphics, as there is nothing to write home about.

Overall, a great disappointment that is best avoided.</desc>

		<desc>Intergalactic hero Space Ace faces off against the evil Commander Borf, who hits him with an Infanto-Ray, turning Ace into an adolescent version of himself called Dexter. Now Ace/Dexter must not only rescue his girlfriend Kimberly but also prevent the destruction of the Earth at the hands of Borf.

Readysoft's version of the laserdisc arcade game Space Ace for 16-bit computers follows the mold of their earlier Dragon's Lair adaptation: only selected scenes from the original game are used, with all the graphics redrawn from the original cel animation to fit the capabilities of the target machines.

As in Dragon's Lair, the game consists of the cartoon movie running by itself, with the player being required to press the right button at the right time (either moving or firing Ace's gun) or see one of many death animations. The original arcade game offered some alternate paths through the game by letting the player choose between playing as Dexter or turning him back into Ace - the computer version is missing this option, and one always plays as Dexter or Ace depending on the scene.</desc>

		<desc>2039 A.D. Man begins deep space exploration in search of new life forms and usable fuel sources. What he discovers is trouble.

Until now, the success of past explorations was causing the space effort to grow by leaps and bounds. Until now, the explorers had found little more than fungus and small insects as alternative lifeforms. Until now, the chief dangers had been those posed by the hostile environment of space. Until now, the aliens had not known about THEM.

On the ragged edge of the galaxy, other creatures that roam the stars discover humans and spaceships to be excellent sources of food and other resources. Prepared at the worst for clashes with rival exploration teams, the human crews can do little to defend themselves as wave upon wave of nightmare creatures descend upon their ships and bases.

In response to their distress calls, the Federation has assembled a series of rescue teams, lead by their best military sharpshooters, to deal with the alien menace. As the leader of one of these teams, you must gun down the intruders and pick up the human survivors. Brave the maze of dark corridors that may lead to a deadly shootout between you and legions of monsters. Pick up survivors and extra ammo on the way.</desc>

		<desc>All over the globe, factories are falling into ruin, economies have fallen apart, interest rates are rising, the TV companies are out of business and (worst of all) milk production has come to a standstill. No more Shredded Wheat for you, mate. So what's behind all this? A band of deadly, virus-like aliens which have infected every part of the planet with their horrible disease, that's what. Pretty nasty, huh? So absolutely, horrendously nasty, in fact, that the combined efforts of the army, the navy, the air force, the fire service, the police, Machomen and Postman Pat have been totally liquidised in their attempt to stop it.

Just when you thought that the end of the world was nigh, when everybody thought it was OK to eat lots of cream cakes 'cos they were gonna die tomorrow anyway, a little speck became visible in the sky. Was it a bird? Was it a helicopter? Was it a speck of chocolate on your glasses? Nope, da da daaaaaa - it was Space Harrier. Yeaaah!

With nothing but a laser and a jetpack to his name, he battles through waves of ugly looking aliens, dodges dangerous missiles, survives end-of-level tussles with great, big enormous fire-breathing dragons, tries to stop himself from splatting, slap bang into the nearest obstacles, get his eyebrows singed and still survives.
Some selfless guy, huh? Not really. He just couldn't face another day without three Shredded Wheat.</desc>

		<desc>Space Pilot '89 is a remake of Space Pilot and a variant of Time Pilot. The background story involves a pilot who gets mixed up in a time trap and visits different time zones. There he has to shoot a certain amount of enemies to get access to the next level which increases the difficulty. Enemies either try to ram the player or shoot rockets.

New in comparison to the original Space Pilot is the power up system: shot enemies may leave symbols behind which grant advantages when picked up, e.g. a shield, automatic fire (both for a limited amount of time) or another weapon. The symbol changes if it is shot. The game scrolls in multiple directions and all few levels there is a boss to defeat.</desc>

		<desc>Six years after its first appearance, the classic sci-fi send-up is back with a vengeance. Equipped with an all-mouse game system, and shrill Nineties graphics is sets out to enrapture the next generation of players.

Prepare to save the world, well Xenon, our hero's home planet, as Roger Wilco tumbles into The Sarien Encounter. Inconveniently for Roger - he's in the middle of a nap - the universe has chosen this exact moment to begin falling apart. No more sleep for Roger.

Full to the brim with Hitchhiker-type humour, it puts the threadbare fabric of recent adventures to shame. It should be an integral part of every ambitious collection, if you have an A3000. Everyone else will be sorely tired by long loading sessions, slow animation and gritty graphics. Sci-fi fanatics must play it, others still can, though Sierra should do their homework and deliver versions that are as much fun on a standard Amiga because they deserve to remain classics.</desc>

		<desc>Following his humorous adventures in previous game, Roger Wilco is relaxing at his favorite pub somewhere in time and space when heavily armed soldiers enter the room. Carrying a parting message from Roger's old nemesis, Sludge Vohaul, they plan to get rid of the janitorial hero, execution style. That is, until a man with an over-sized hair dryer helps Roger escape through a time rip into the future. Now Roger Wilco has woken up on his home planet, some time in a meta-fictional Space Quest XII. It is a grim, dystopian future: the series has gone to ruin without its hero, and Vohaul rules supreme. Roger must find a way to avoid Vohaul's henchmen, fulfill his destiny, and learn about a few surprises that await him in his own future.

Space Quest IV is the first in the Space Quest series to feature Sierra's icon-based SCI interface and 256-color graphics. The command set includes icons for walking, looking, using or taking, talking, smelling, tasting, as well as inventory access. Roger Wilco is shown on the screen from the exterior in multiple viewpoints. Like in the previous games, inventory-based puzzle-solving co-exists with timed tasks and various hazards that will kill Roger if the player is not careful.</desc>

		<desc>Space Ranger takes the Defender theme, and developes it into a far superior game. A multitude of highly imaginative, friendly looking critters (as they are called), innocently go about their daily business. Most are ground-based, and run up and down or leap into the air. Others swoop around the sky, merrily tweeting and quacking. All this is set against a three speed paralax scrolling background of mountains and forests.

But here come no-good aliens to put a downer on things. A mother ship hovers in wait for any unsuspecting critters to wander beneath it. It then turns on a tractor beam which pulls them into the craft. A well aimed shot will kill these, freeing the poor little cubes. On the other hand, a poorly aimed shower of laser fire could easily result in a critter being shot.

Space Ranger's appeal is mainly in its cuteness. The effective backgrounds make the game a pleasure to watch. Defender variants are nothing new, but this is the best I've seen. Space Ranger is also fun to play, and whilst not stunning, is an example to be followed by other budget companies. Definitely one of the best cheapies around. Highly recommended.</desc>

		<desc>Special Forces is a top-down arcade shooting game with a dash of strategy. It is the sequel to Airborne Ranger.

When times are rough, the American people rely on their army. And when times are rough, the American army relies on their special forces. A small group of highly trained, superbly skilled, well-armed and clean-shaven elite soldiers boldly go where no man has gone before. At least no honest man.

Special Forces let's you control a team of four in a top-down view and setting reminiscent of Jagged Alliance, only that the time ticks continuously. Consequently, strategy and stealth stand back behind Gauntlet-style arcade action. Moving alone or in squad formation, you shoot enemy soldiers and blow up bunkers, always quick to go in and quicker yet to go out. Goals vary from deploying laser targeting systems for air strikes to assassinations to rescue missions; some assignments take place under cover of darkness, with night vision systems coloring the landscape a gloomy green.

16 missions take you to four different parts of the world, from the terrorist's arctic ice to the drug cartel's native jungle. Before hopping into the helicopter, you may choose four soldiers out of eight, each with different special abilities, and equip each one. Reading the text briefings is crucial, as the game won't warn you if you go on a bombing raid without any explosives. Also, the higher the difficulty level you choose, the less accurate is the info that you get on your targets, so you'll have to search the area. Luckily, a detailed map provides an overview. As enemies respawn and ammo depletes, some men may not make it back. Those who do can be awarded medals and promotions, which will boost their morale and increase their stats.</desc>

		<desc>You play a real high-flying marine asked to save four famous harbours from enemy forces using just a speedboat and a few missiles.

Viewed from above and behind, like the perspective of a racing game, the boat has to be steered between two lines of mines for the first part of each harbour. Then, with missiles, you must destroy enemy boats and the four communication towers which control them. Later, a helicopter increases your abilities with rocket launchers, speed, maneuverability and smart bombs.

The main sprite isn't bad but the horizon graphics and other sprites are simple and jerky in comparison. At least the water's silly stripes move smoothly. The Amiga version's playable, so you shouldn't have too much trouble reaching the weak shooting sections. This game is not recommended.</desc>

		<desc>Spellbound Dizzy is by far the best escapade the little egg has had. With colourful graphics and the usual Dizzy gameplay.

It's not really worth relating the plot, suffice it to say that our Diz has to save the Yolkfolk from the standard terrible fate. Along the way he has to collect and manipulate various objects, while communicating with certain other characters.

It doesn't push the Amiga to its limits, and neither is it astounding in terms of
originality, but the unique charm of CodeMasters' cartoon hero is undeniable. Perhaps the game's only flaw is that there's a little too much wandering back and forth.

It's not a classic by any means, but you'd be as mad as a March Hare if you haven't at least looked at it yet.</desc>

		<desc>Spherical Worlds is a multi-directional shoot 'em up in the vein of Alien Breed where players control a small spherical droid which needs to destroy enemy robots on a space station. Each level is won by navigating the maze correctly and reaching the exit, sometimes requiring keys that need to be collected.

The droid has both a set amount of extra lives and a health bar, which is reduced by touching other robots. There is one main weapon (which can overheat) and a secondary weapon with limited ammo. At the end of each level, weapon upgrades can be bought in a shop.

The most important aspect of gameplay is that the droid can easily fall off edges or through holes. Different terrains have effects on the acceleration and friction of the droid, so the player has to carefully navigate the levels.</desc>

The droid has both a set amount of extra lives and a health bar, which is reduced by touching other robots. There is one main weapon (which can overheat) and a secondary weapon with limited ammo. At the end of each level, weapon upgrades can be bought in a shop.

The most important aspect of gameplay is that the droid can easily fall off edges or through holes. Different terrains have effects on the acceleration and friction of the droid, so the player has to carefully navigate the levels.</desc>

		<desc>A spiritual descendant of War in Middle Earth, Spirit of Excalibur uses the same engine to tell the tale of what befell Camelot after the death of King Arthur. 

You play the role of the regent who holds the throne while chaos spreads through Britain. The game is broken into a number of episodes, which carry the overall plot of trying to restore Arthur's kingdom to some semblance of what it once was. Early episodes involve gathering the Knights of the Round Table, who have broken their fellowship. Because of their general distrust and dislike of certain other members, many knights will only return if asked by certain people and/or are given the correct incentive. Ultimately, you will wage a war on the sons of Mordred, who vie for the same throne their father did and stop the machinations of Morgan LeFay.

The game is played on two different levels. The first is a real time map where groups move about from place to place. At any time (or when a group encounters another or a place of importance) you can switch to a 'scene' level, which is a side-view of the group currently highlighted. Here you can pick up, drop, and manipulate quest items.</desc>

		<desc>This game is based on the long-running British satirical television show with puppet likenesses of political figures and celebrities. A prophet determines that a world war will occur in seven years instigated by a mysterious leader. To avoid this, one ruler of the world must be determined in this beat 'em up involving six rulers: U.S.A.'s Ronald Regan, the U.K.'s Margaret Thatcher, the USSR's Mikhail Gorbachev, South Africa's PW Botha, Iran's Ayathollah Khomeini, and Pope John Paul II. 

Having chosen which to play as, you travel to an opponent's country to engage in a best-of-three fight that is judged by Queen Elizabeth II on a postage stamp. You attack each opponent on the ground as well as jumping in the air and each character has a special move like Thatcher's head-butt or Khomeini's beard whip. You can also call for help twice from an aide who will usually throw a projectile at your opponent. If you manage to defeat all 5 opponents, you will meet the mysterious leader in a final showdown in a mud-wrestling pit in the dark where you will only be able to see the eyes of the characters. You can also play 2-player fights, one against another on the same computer.</desc>

		<desc>Star Crusader is a 3D space combat simulator in which the player takes the role of Roman Alexandria who is in the middle of a galaxy-wide war between the authoritarian Gorenes and rebels. 

During the course of the game, the player can decide which of the opposing forces to join. Both sides in the game feature very different crafts. The Gorenes has rather conventional crafts for solidly armed and armored crafts. The rebel side features some unusual weapons like disabler beam, cloaking device, and other special abilities.</desc>

		<desc>All is not well in Endor. Those imperial stormtroopers are harassing the populace, the "aww"-inspiring, oh-so-cute Ewoks.

Leia and Luke are a bit cut off in the forests of Endor - sounds painful - and have to run the gauntlet of stormtroopers on Speederbikes. The whole bit is like Spy Hunter with a Zaxxon perspective, plus added trees and Ewok traps. The second bit has Lando Calrissian piloting the Millennium Falcon down the reactor tube of the Death Star. Using the same perspective as the forest bit, it is basically a question of avoiding the sticky-out bits and the annoying little Tie fighter bits. Now you are Chewbacca at the controls of a scout walker, trying to run the gamut of logs and rocks on your way to the bunker. Moving logs can he shot, but the big piles of them have to be strolled around.

Every-thing is carried out the way you'd expect on an Amiga - sampled speech from the film, pretty graphics... switch off the brain and be prepared for some unsophisticated violent enjoyment. Return of the Jedi is grand while it lasts, but since it's a little superfish (as in superfishul, not as in halibut)  that may not be forever.</desc>

		<desc>The arcade game from Atari Games based on the second Star Wars movie features four action sequences inspired by the film. The graphical style is similar to the first Star Wars game, using vector graphics with a first-person perspective.

The first sequence takes place on the ice planet Hoth, where the player must destroy Imperial probe droids. The droids send transmissions to the Empire that can also be targeted and destroyed. Once enough transmissions have been sent, the Empire attacks.

In the second sequence, the player has to fend off Imperial walkers, either by shooting a limited number of tow cables at their feet or by targeting a small area at their head with lasers. But sooner or later, the Rebel base's power generator will be destroyed and the evacuation begins.

In the third sequence, the Millennium Falcon has to destroy TIE Fighters in space.

In the fourth and final sequence, the Falcon must navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding collisions.

Once the four sections have been completed, the game restarts at a higher difficulty level.</desc>

		<desc>A horizontally-scrolling shoot 'em up from the last days of the basic 68000-powered Amiga. The levels are taller than the screen, so you can move up or down them and take on a selection of the different enemy waves each time.

At the start of the game you choose your primary and secondary weapon. Pressing fire briefly activates the primary; holding it down activates the secondary - therefore you can't use both at the same time. These can be powered up to various levels, and changed around by picking up tokens, although switching weapon or losing a life reduces your firepower initially. Continues and extra lives are on offer, as are a simultaneous 2-player mode, choice of sounds effects and/or music, and a music test menu.

		<desc>Starflight comes complete with a photo of a haggard looking group of American programmers dressed in spacesuits, but looking more like MacDonalds crew members. This game is set in one of the dodgiest area known to software - it's an Elite clone.

You begin your quest in the round, anonymous bowl of the spaceport where you have a minimal amount of money to recruit a crew and equip your spacecraft. You then set off on an interplanetary flight by dragging a mouse around the solar system. Once you've established an orbit around the planet a revolving planet appears on which you can attempt a landing. You can then get onto your 4x4 range rover/mining machine and explore the surface. This is one of the best aspects of Starflight, as you zip around in search of bounty. Then, much like Elite, it's time to return to the starport to flog what you found.

The systems are detailed with a good balance of interesting and not so interesting planets to explore. Where it loses out is in the space combat which is entirely formularised and really pretty dull. As you progress your options are made clear, whilst still leaving you a good margin of choice which gives the game a more RPG-like touch. Even taking into account the total unoriginality of the overall concept, EA have done an excellent job of making this as playable as possible. It will not become a classic, but Starlight made a very passable distraction and will almost certainly have you extracting your money's worth of entertainment as easily as your terrain vehicle scoops up minerals.</desc>

		<desc>Futuristic sports game roughly based on Pong. The idea is to hit the ball into the other half of the area (hopefully going over some point scoring blocks on the way) and hope that it bounces back off the far wall back into your hands (and so you can take another shot). That's of course while your opposition tries to catch the ball for themselves and score some points with it.

You have to pay to play someone and so you "gamble" your entry fee: Lose and you lose your money, win the match and you win more money. Eventually you have enough to challenge the sport's star players and win some big bucks!

		<desc>Hard is not the word for it. You're harder than very hard, you're even harder than the hardest that ever... erm... was really hard. You're so hard, in fact, that you've decided to prove it to the rest of the world. The meanest, nastiest, vilest street fighters of five different nations have agreed to take you on in one of the dirtiest, most underhand, no-holds-barred street fighting contests in the universe ever.

If this is a top-quality beat 'em up then I'm a one-eyed Romanian greengrocer. Talk about easy - you don't even need to study the moves to be able to knock practically everyone out in under an minute. I got right through to the last toughie on my first go - which doesn't exactly say much for the product's lastability. I can't say I was overly impressed by the graphics, the sound or the slow-motion gameplay - in fact I can't say I was overly impressed by anything at all. Even the bonus section takes ages to react to your frantic pushing of the joystick - by which time your energy bar has gone back down to minimum. If you're after a beat 'em up leave this one lying on the shelf.</desc>

		<desc>Let's deal with the quirky bits of the game first, starting with the soccer mode. This is just plain bizarre. You play on half a footy pitch and the simple idea is to charge around in your car trying to get possession of the ball before racing towards the goal and sticking it in the onion bag.

And it shouldn't take very long to exhaust Rumble Mode, even when there are up to four of you playing. You drive around a small circular course in which you go faster at the outside edge than you do at the centre. The idea is simple enough - drive around smacking the other players into the walls on the outside of the course. After a couple of hits, the walls disappear.

The racing then. At the lights, press accelerate and try to come in the top four to qualify for the next track. This is Championship mode, by the way. There's also a Head to Head mode in which just you and another driver are racing each other, er, head to head. Whichever you choose, you're going to have to avoid the roadside obstacles and try to collect the power-ups and avoid the power-downs as you whizz round the tracks.

Animation is on the jerky side in the actual game and it's curious to see your car going sideways round a relatively gentle corner. The backgrounds are very good though. Well done chaps, you've made a crap racing game with some nice backgrounds. Money well spent on the development then. Did I get to mention the dreadful music and crap sound effects yet? Oh good, that's worked out nicely because they're a fine sour note to end the review on.</desc>

		<desc>Street Rod is a car racing game with a difference - and loads of atmosphere as well. It's set in the days when cars were really cars and milk bars were really milk bars. First you'll have to buy your car - look through the classified ads in the newspaper on the screen. Then get to work in the body-shop - maybe a new paint job in something tasteful like hot pink. Then it's out with the engine. A workshop screen lets you pull it to pieces, make timing adjustments and add high performance parts.

Then it's off to the race track. A cruise down the main street to show off your wheels will always result in a challenge - and usually there's a little wager on the side. The race sequences are difficult, and you only get one chance. Crash your car and it's back to the body repair shop. Not only that, your bank balance drops alarmingly. You can use joystick or mouse controls - I'm still not sure which I like best, but I suspect the joystick gives the best feel.

Graphics are very nice, music is atmospheric - all in all, Street Rod is a hot game.</desc>

		<desc>SR2 is primarily a racing game, with an interesting premise. You buy and race muscle cars in the 1960s. Except, these are not professional races. Instead, you challenge drivers at the local burger joint for illegal races down Mullholland drive.

I knew the magazine reviews had said quality was average, but still a decent game. It turned out to be much better than I thought it would be. Lots of emphasis is placed on upgrading your car. You have to spend your money wisely, and pick the best parts for the money. Once your car has been upgraded and modified, you drive it down to the local burger and fries joint. There, you will find a variety of other muscle cars, you can ask to look at their engine, and challenge them to a race. They may even challenge you to a race. Only drivers with cars similar or better will agree to a race. Naturally, as the game goes on, the races go for more money, and some challengers will only race for pink slips, and the game becomes serious. Obviously, losing a race at this level means the game is over.

Driving simulation part was terrible. It was slow, and the graphics were poor. It reminded me of running test drive on an old 8086 PC. Overall, good concept. I find it strange that the driving section was so terrible. However, the upgrade and challenge sections are well made, and easy to navigate and use. Not recommended unless you like working on cars.</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;The warrior returns with a vengeance in his ultimate fight for freedom. 
&amp;gt;A flash of steel, a blast from his devastating Gyro laser gun - 
&amp;gt;Strider's back in action, pulverising the enemy and striving for 
&amp;gt;justice. This time, there will be
















&amp;gt;NO LIMITS... NO MERCY... NO SURRENDER!
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;
















***Strider II*** (released in North America under the title of Journey 
from Darkness: Strider Returns), is a side-scrolling platform game 
published by U.S. Gold (under license from Capcom USA) and originally 
released for various computer platforms in 1990. It is a 
European-developed sequel to Capcom's arcade game Strider, which 
U.S. Gold previously ported to home computers in Europe. The game 
was developed by Tiertex, as with Human Killing Machine, the U.S. Gold  
sequel to Street Fighter.
















Strider II was released for the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST, 
Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum. Strider II was later 
remade for the Mega Drive and Master System in 1992.
















In the computer versions of Strider II the objective of the game is to 
rescue the Princess of Planet Magenta from a terrorist group that are 
keeping her captive. The controls in the computer version are similar 
to U.S. Gold's home computer ports of the original Strider, although 
the character cannot slide nor climb ceilings like in the original 
game. However, he can still climb walls, as well as ropes. In addition 
to his cypher, he can also use a rifle whenever he is still standing 
still. If the player has collected enough energy icons throughout each 
stage, they transform into a wheeled robot when confronting the boss 
at the end of each stage. As a robot, the Strider can shoot lasers, 
but cannot jump nor crouch. His robot form has a separate energy gauge 
from his regular energy gauge as a human. When his robot gauge runs 
out, he will transform back to a human. The game consists of five 
stages.

		<desc>One of the best M.U.L.E. clones ever made, Subtrade: Return to Irata transfers the galactic capitalism of Dani Bunten's timeless classic to an undersea economy.

Despite new species, background graphics, and different commodities, gameplay is still M.U.L.E. at its heart: up to four players vie in a cutthroat competition to be the richest businessman in a futuristic economy. The different phases of M.U.L.E., e.g. land grant, production, and marketing, are preserved intact and are greatly enhanced by intuitive mouse-based interface and 16-bit graphics. The auction interface, which is the best part of M.U.L.E., is still as furious and fun as ever, with computer players that are aggressive enough to pose a real challenge. Unlike Linel's Traders, another M.U.L.E. clone, Subtrade does not introduce new gameplay options or the number of commodities.

Overall, Subtrade is definitely one of the best M.U.L.E. clones, if not THE best. M.U.L.E. fans will definitely enjoy this one, although the disappointing lack of tournament mode means that an average game with 4 players can be finished in less than 1-2 hours.</desc>

		<desc>Subbuteo recreates the famous table football game, which makes for something very different from Sensible/Kick Off/FIFA style games. It's effectively a turn-based strategy game of sorts, as each player has 30 seconds to make their move (within a 30 minute match length), which involves first selecting a player, then aiming the direction in which he will be flicked, then the power and swerve of the flick are determined by the length of time the button is held down for. 

With any luck, your player will hit the ball, and hit it such that it doesn't leave the playing area, and doesn't hit an opponent. If any of those rules are violated, possession passes to the opposition. Before each flick, the team not in possession can make a 'defensive flick' involving moving one of their players into a potential blocking position (without hitting the ball or an opponent, as this is a foul).</desc>

&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;




***Super Cars*** is a top-view racing game from Gremlin Interactive, 
who later produced the Lotus series of games. Stylistically, the game 
is influenced by Super Sprint.




There are 9 tracks at each of the 4 difficulty levels, which can be 
raced in any order (although the last track you race is made harder 
than usual). In the races you win money, which can be spent on temporary 
handling and power upgrades, plus armour plating and front/rear shooting 
missiles that can knock out other racers. The player must finish in the 
top 3 of each race to progress - initially there are 4 computer 
opponents, but more are added as you progress through the game.




The car can be upgraded throughout the game via the shop section. The 
player is given an initial price, but also a number of options of things 
to say to the salesman - with the right combination, the price will 
drop.




An unusual easter egg was featured in the game, whereby typing in a 
certain swear word in the name screen will reset the game.

		<desc>If you have never heard of Jeff Minter, or "Attack of the Mutant Camels" then you have lived a sheltered life. Minter's games have a simple approach to things. You shoot them.

The graphics in Super Grid Runner are simple, colourful and flash so brightly that any life form more advanced than humans (dolphins, mice and so on) may find that actual pain is induced. Sounds are similarly psychedelic and when amplified are almost, but not quite, totally unlike a Disaster Area concert. There are a large number of levels with which the earth creature may choose to begin the mindless destruction.

These proceed with a definite lack of seriousness. Some might say they are fun. They would be right. They are indeed, as they say, fun.</desc>

		<desc>Super Loopz is a revamped version of Loopz. Feature enhanced graphics and new musics, but the same gameplay: sort of Tetris encounter Pipe Dream. Tubes of random shapes drop on to a board, and by rotating and placing them you have to make shapes that join up in loops. Once you have placed a piece you can't remove it, except by using a special items which destroy every part of an incomplete loop it touches; every tenth loop takes you to a new level.</desc>

		<desc>Thirty levels of boulder-blasting await in this platform shoot &#x2018;em up, which can be thought of as Pang meets Turrican. The levels start with varying amounts of boulders, and as soon as you shoot at one of them, it breaks up into 2 more which are half the size. Eventually they become small enough that they disappear. 

Your character is a human sprite, so you&#x2019;re bound to the ground unless you can jump onto one of the strategically-placed ledges. There are several different weapons available, which you don&#x2019;t lose when you die.

There are numerous different control options &#x2013; the standard one involves always firing in the direction you&#x2019;re aiming, but others include one where your firing direction can be changed by flicking the joystick with fire held down, an option where you move using the main 4 directions and use the bottom-left and bottom-right diagonal to rotate the firing direction, and an option where you use one joystick for direction of movement, and the other for direction of fire.

		<desc>Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers for A1200 AGA machine is little less ugly and faster and is the best Amiga Street Fighter so far! You would be forgiven for thinking this is some dodgy shareware copyright infringing knock off, yet it is a fully licensed and US Gold backed game!

To be honest AGA version looks better than the A500 but not much. The backgrounds look poorly drawn lacking any animation with colour pallets that look like they date back to the late 80's, while the fighters have shrunk dramatically lacking detail and character, but for everything it lacks in visual fidelity it makes up in speed and smoothness. A1200 version is treated to some enhanced visuals such as overlayed power bars, but also you will hit the holy grail of 50fps which will have you forgiving the game for being so ugly! Up the turbo speed, throw it into NTSC mode and hold on tight!

Sound is present and accounted for giving music and SFX at the same time, and while nothing brilliant it manages to preserve the arcade feel. Increased speed means the game play is right up there with the arcade version resulting in some frantic rounds.

No game's worth this amount of disk accessing. The game's fast flowing, punchy and varied, but let down by terrible sound, minute graphics and terrible, TERRIBLE disk accessing. You'd have to be a big fan to forgive all its problems.</desc>

Up the turbo speed, throw it into NTSC mode and hold on tight!

Sound is present and accounted for giving music and SFX at the same time, and while nothing brilliant it manages to preserve the arcade feel. Increased speed means the game play is right up there with the arcade version resulting in some frantic rounds.

No game's worth this amount of disk accessing. The game's fast flowing, punchy and varied, but let down by terrible sound, minute graphics and terrible, TERRIBLE disk accessing. You'd have to be a big fan to forgive all its problems.</desc>

		<desc>Superman comes on two discs and is split into several sub games, each more perilous than the last. As the game loads, a very agreeable rendition of the Superman theme plays in stereo harmony.

A nice, if somewhat pointless addition to the game is a mini comic strip which describes the storyline of the current mission. The first of these sees Superman battling Darkseid's Parra demons. Space Harrier style. Whether Superman selects heat vision or super-strength, you have to select the less than superhuman power of extreme patience to overcome the evil Parra demons. Once the first level has been completed the game becomes much more playable. As well as having to deal with Darkseid you must take on Lex Luthor, who has formed an alliance with Darkseid to destroy the earth.

Graphics are true to the comic, our hero being authentically recreated in pixels. Some of his flying is a shade rusty, but on the whole the game has been well implemented. The music and FX are top notch, especially the high score table which shows Superman's home at the North Pole. Overall, though, it lacks that special something.</desc>

		<desc>Supremacy: Your Will Be Done, released as Overlord in the US, is a strategy video game designed by David Perry &amp; Nick Bruty and produced by Probe Software.

The goal of Supremacy is to create and protect a network of planetary colonies and defeat a computer adversary who is trying to do the same. There are four skill levels, each represented by an enemy race, and each featuring a progressively stronger opponent. The more advanced a system is, the more freedom a player has when purchasing spacecraft. Higher skill levels also result in different numbers of planets in each system.

The game was initially released for the Amiga and Atari ST computers in the beginning of 1990.</desc>

		<desc>Three years in the making, Swords of Twilight is a gorgeously illustrated fantasy roleplaying adventure. The three members of your party can be played independently by up to three humans using a unique multi-player interface (which is the game's strongest and weakest link) or the computer can control both your companions if you'd rather quest alone. Quirky, non-standard key usage (with no mouse control) is irksome and hampers player maneuverability. The story and characters are lavish and intriguing: with eight parallel worlds to search through for the Swords of Twilight you'll be busy for weeks.</desc>

		<desc>T-Racer is a 2D side-scrolling shoot 'em up with a side view. Written for Amiga line of computers entirely in Assembly 68000.

Technically it offered the best that existed at the time: multi-layer parallax scrolling, hundreds of on-screen color, dozens of BOB (Blitter Objects, or sprite, for non-Amigans), scroll extremely fluid.

Call me old-fashioned, but I'm in it for the effects--explosions are good, and the last blue 'rippley-looking level' really hit the eye-cones. Music's good. Overall: difficult, somewhat interesting.</desc>

		<desc>An old-fashioned horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up in the R-Type vein. Compared to the First-Person Shooters, it might seem quaint, but it's interesting to see this style done using later Amiga hardware capabilities and features.

There are 3 different ships on offer, as part of a high level of customisability, including an Arcade mode with bonus fruit, variable colour explosions, and variable background detail for those who find that the most colourful version obscures some of the enemies.

There are two different routes through each level, but either way results in hordes of enemies to take on - horizontally scrolling shooters tend to be tricky, due to the amount of things happening on screen at once. Like so many FPSs but so few scrolling shooters, you can design your own levels as well.</desc>

		<desc>This is an arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance.

Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.

Terminator 2: Judgment Day, renamed T2: The Arcade Game for home conversions, features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.

Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).</desc>

You can play a full season of tournaments, with world rankings updated as you go. Singles and doubles matches are on offer, and their lengths are variable. A full ball-machine training mode is offered, which allows you to face a succession of shots, with a choice of shot styles and speeds to allow you to hone problem areas of your game. Two player matches can also be played, and mouse or joystick control are supported.</desc>

		<desc>Take 'em Out is a typical Op Wolf clone, only more violent. Blood flows freely as you tear your way through wave after wave of terrorists and the odd civilian hostage. Before you are let out on your wave of carnage you have to qualify on the shooting range. The first of these has the standard targets flashing up to be greeted with a twelve gauge shot gun. Score the necessary amount and you are let loose in the armoury.

Take 'em Out is a respectable game, good fun to play with a laughably large amount of gore. Then you finish the third level, and you get the 'Congratulations you have completed your mission' screen! If it was not for the lack of levels, Take 'em Out could be a substantially superior game to what it now is. As it stands though, it is a quick-finish gun 'em down and an expensive way to spend a commercial break.</desc>

		<desc>Ha! Here's something you didn't know: you've got an uncle called Arthur. He's not from East Enders and he doesn't have a mate called Terry but he does own the mining rights to T'ngl-y-wd. Spit in my eye, eh? Isn't the world a small place guv'nor? Well, yeah, it is a small place and that is why T'ngl-y-wd isn't on it - actually. It's a 'small undistinguished planet in a remote galaxy'. Arthur didn't worry about it much until he found out that it contained some pretty valuable stones, then he shot his mouth off over a couple of pints of beer and was elbowed out by the mining company. Yup, those nice men at the mining centre have hidden Arthur's documents and re-established the planet's operational base. There's a court case in ten days and Arthur (sounds a bit like my uncle, Ripperbile) needs to find those papers or he's out on his ear.

This is definitely an arcade-style adventure weighted towards the arcade. You might find the puzzles pretty devious, but it's all a question of having the right thing at the right time. If you like your adventures grilled and ready to eat you probably won't find Tanglewood instantly appealing. You could spend ages exploring this deep and mysterious world - there must be some juicy titbits somewhere - but it takes so long to get anywhere that you might decide to throw your disk over the nearest bridge and cut your toenails instead. But watch out - you might start enjoying yourself!</desc>

		<desc>Yankee can't compare with M-1 for realism, but it's an extremely playable and enjoyable sim. The essence of the game is a mix of tactics - critical in positioning your forces and timing artillery strikes - and arcade action. Swiveling the turret, finding the enemy, getting a laser lock-on, waiting for a round to be loaded then knocking a tank out all requires good reactions. Then as soon as the first shot hits, the rest of the platoon will know your position and return fire, so it's critical to take them all out quickly. This is great fun, helped along by great graphics. Up close things are blocky, especially the UDG-style forests, but overall the effect is top-notch. The game's only real drawback is the lack of scenarios. Enemy intelligence does increase dramatically as ranks improve, but new scenarios would've been best.</desc>

In the first part you drive around in your red Ferrari and destroy hostile cars; in the second part, you turn somersaults over gaps, use elevators and shoot lots of enemies until you reach the boss. After having killed / caught the villain, it's back to the road again for the next mission.</desc>

		<desc>It's another Breakout variant: with the help of a paddle at the lower edge of the screen, you have to play back a ball, and you have to remove the built-up stone formations. Besides the well-known clasps, bigger paddles and laser guns, there are also magnets, more effective balls and additional paddles. You can pre-order them in a shop for the next level after each game has been started. The game is well done: a lot of background, convincing animations and remarkable pieces of music.

Many, many years ago, Tecnoball would probably have become a hit, but today you get only the great yawning...</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;The Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles are out to rescue lovely April O'Neil, 
&amp;gt;who's been captured by SHREDDER - a maniac more menacing than an army of 
&amp;gt;mind altered Bruce Lees.
  
&amp;gt;But if they're to succeed, you must command the role of each turtle 
&amp;gt;(one at a time, of course), rumbling through six New York territories 
&amp;gt;patrolled by Ninjitsu Warriors, blood descendants of the deadly Foot 
&amp;gt;Clan.
  
&amp;gt;Along the way, you'll encounter Mouser infested sewers, criminally 
&amp;gt;polluted rivers and villainous streets run by the terrorist team of 
&amp;gt;Bebop and Rocksteady.
  
&amp;gt;To overcome these inhumane hazards, utilize your reptilian brain and 
&amp;gt;map out strategies that will help you locate secret sewage passages. 
&amp;gt;Also be sure to alternate your turtle identity throughout the mission, 
&amp;gt;matching each turtle's strengths with those of the ever changing enemy.
















&amp;gt;So grab your nunchukus and prepare to put yourself in someone else's 
&amp;gt;shell. Because in this to-the-death adventure, you'll control every 
&amp;gt;leap, chop, slice and dice, until you knock heads with Shredder and 
&amp;gt;either splatter him senseless or get yourself turned into turtle soup.

***Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles***, originally released as Fierce Turtle 
Ninja Legend in Japan and later as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles in Europe,
is a 1989 platform game for the Famicom/NES. The game was released in 
Japan through Konami themselves, then in North America through Konami's 
Ultra Games imprint, followed by a release through the European equivalent
, Palcom Software, in PAL regions.
















This was the first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video game, and is based 
on the 1987 TV series, which was in its third season at the time of the 
game's original release, although the art style more resembles the 
original TMNT comic series.
















The game was ported to various home computer platforms in 1990, including
the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum and Amiga. The DOS version is
infamous, as it contains a gap that is impossible to cross without 
cheating.

***Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles***, released as Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles: Super Kame Ninja in Japan and ***Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles*** 
in Europe, is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up released by Konami as a 
coin-operated video game in 1989. It is based on the first Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtles animated series which began airing in the winter 
of 1987. The original coin-operated game was distributed to the arcades 
in two variants: a standard 2-player version that allowed either player 
to choose their character and a deluxe 4-player version with each player 
controlling a different character. Home versions of the game were 
released for various platforms.
















The computer ports of the arcade game were released by Image Works and 
ported by Probe Software in 1991 for the ZX Spectrum, Amiga, 
Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, PC and Commodore 64. The title was changed to 
Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Coin Op in the European versions 
(Hero being the re-branding of the license in Europe due to censorship 
issues) and lacked the extra stages and bosses from the NES game.

		<desc>The Temple of Apshai followed the general idea of Dungeons and Dragons, with lots of monsters to meet in battle and treasure to be found.

You can start from scratch, with your character given a random 1 to 18 for six basic attributes: Intelligence, intuition, ego, strength, constitution and dexterity, together with a number of silver pieces. You can enter a previously saved character from disc. Thankfully this interpretation has superior graphics attributes of a character from an earlier game. You can restore a previous game saved at any point within Apshai.

Each realm has four levels. Dungeons and Dragons followers will find levels 1 to 2 are appropriate to third level, and the lower levels to fourth and sixth level characters. There are special commands, such as examining a wall for secret doors, opening doors, searching for traps, picking up treasures, listening for monsters, talking to monsters, healing with salves or elixirs, checking the and a few healing salves, you are inventory of your treasures or saving the game or character for future use. Most levels of each realm have 50 to 60 rooms, so there is plenty to explore. Some monsters are tied to particular locations, but others wander around looking for the odd meal. The innkeeper will pay you for any treasure you have collected so you have a chance to add to or improve your equipment.

There is a little more to Apshai than straightforward monster bashing, but nowhere near the depth of puzzles and quests to be found in more modern offerings such as Ultima and Bard's Tale.</desc>

		<desc>Terry's Big Adventure looks and feels somewhat similar to Mario's, being a side-scrolling platform game using stylised block graphics and lots of ledges to climb up and around. Terry is armed with a yo-yo which can be directed as a weapon by pushing the joystick as you hold down fire - an idea later repeated by Trolls. On this occasion the use of the yo-yo causes Terry to recoil slightly, so be careful that this does not push him off a ledge or into the path of another enemy.

There are 12 levels in total, incorporating many rivers to cross as well as hordes of hedgehogs, snails and similar to kill. Hidden bonus objects and time extensions can be found. When you start a new game you start form the last level you reached, so you effectively have unlimited continues.</desc>

		<desc>Test Drive was the first game I played on an Amiga of any kind. The intro, with the guy rolling down the window of the Porsche and grinning before driving off blew us all away. The graphics at the time were something else.

In the game itself, the graphics were excellent for the time - realistic car dashboard etc. Okay, so the scaling of the other cars was dodgy but you didn't notice those things at the time. In these days, a 1/2 meg A500 being able to produce this was pretty good.

The sound was good - each car (Corvette, Lamborghini Countach, Lotus Esprit, Porsche 911 and Ferrari Testarossa) had a distinctive sound which presumably sounded like the real thing. Like I've driven one! The premise was simple: drive from petrol station to petrol station as fast as possible.

Okay, so the game was easy to beat, but with 5 different cars and average speeds given for each level, there was variety available. Outrunning the cops would give a rush too. I think that this game was responsible for at least 3 people buying an A500, myself included.</desc>

		<desc>Thai Boxing is a one on one fighting game shown from an isometric perspective. Different joystick combinations let your fighter perform high, middle or low attacking moves as well as dodge or block his opponent's attacks. Fighters receive scores for successful attacks. The more difficult or effective the attack, the higher the score. Unless one fighter is knocked out, the fighter who has the highest score at the end of three rounds wins.

Although the game is shown from an isometric perspective, it is not possible to move in three dimensions.

		<desc>You can keep your Retaliators and keep your supersonic high altitude bombers. What you really want are good ol' Spitfires and Messerschmitts to go dogfighting in - or so Lucasfilm will have us believe in their follow up to the great Battlehawks 1942. Anyone with even a basic knowledge of recent British history will recognise the immortal words used in the title, so it is no shock to find out that this game is a combat flight sim based on aircraft that were around in the first half of the Second World War.

First of all, you can decide which side to fight for, but remember the decision here limits which craft are available to fly - no Spitfires in the Luftwaffe! The Brits have got Hurricanes and Spits to fight in while the German have not only fighters, but medium and long range bombers and dive bombers. Each plane has several missions set aside for it that can be played in any order. The missions are varied and range from straight dogfights to scramble and intercept missions. Once a mission is completed the combat records are updated and stored to disk.

Then there are the campaign games if you feel like playing for a long while, where you take charge of your side's airforce and try to either bomb the blazes out of blighty or not, depending which side you are on.</desc>

		<desc>The Third Courier is set in the era of the 'cold war', and the action takes place in Germany. The player is an American spy, and his mission is to recover stolen NATO defense plans.

You start off in your apartment, which contains a computer, bugging equipment and an answerphone, as well as useful items such as money and a passport. A compass on screen is used to move around, with symbols appearing on the left and right of the status screen to indicate when something important is to the west or east of you. 

You will have to explore the city streets, with the aid of taxis and the Autobahn. Talk to important people and buy key objects, and then sneak around spying on anyone who seems suspicious. Encounters with enemy agents, muggers and tramps can turn violent; when they do, use your gun quickly to ensure they are shot first.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the Avalon Hill boardgame, Third Reich lets you play not only as Hitler and his staff, but also as the allied powers. The scenario is limited to the European theatre.

The game is played in rounds of three months, split into several phases such as declaration of war, movement, battle and construction.

You begin the game by declaring war. Which front you open up first will determine the further development of the war. Warring nations are split into two kinds - great military powers such as the allies and the axis, and neutral states.

One resource to be househeld with is your gross national product. This is the resource that will be expended when you build up your armies, and eventually send them to war.

The game has a multitude of scenarios, each with its own goals; just killing your enemy is not the best way to win, if at all.

Just as in the board game, the action takes place on a hexagon map of Europe.</desc>

		<desc>I have got a problem with computer pinball games. Football, golf, cricket and darts. I have played and enjoyed on the Amiga - but pinball? Nah. If you have got a pound in your pocket and are in the centre of a large town, you will be surrounded by all manner of real silver ball opportunities in arcades and pubs.

Now I will readily admit that if you are three years old (Thomas is aimed at age three upwards), you are unlikely to find yourself with a pound in your pocket in the centre of a large town with time to kill. If you do, you are lost, or your parents have abandoned you. Find a policeman immediately.

There are four tables (Thomas, Percy, James and Toby), multi-player options and it all works reasonably well - the ball rolls towards the flippers, you hit it and it bounces around the table until it goes out. Some of the shots are very difficult, and some are virtually impossible, but that is not different to other 'adult' tables. It all scrolls reasonably well, it is bright and colourful (kids are bound to like it) and, well, it is a perfectly functional kids' pinball game. Buy it if you want a reasonable kids' pinball game for your Amiga.

However, there is an alternative. Have you thought about investing in a sturdy box or crate? If you do, you can visit your local, child-friendly pub, put 1 in the pinball machine, place the child on the sturdy box or crate facing the table, repair to the bar and leave your offspring playing the real thing and annoying everyone within a 10-yard radius.</desc>

		<desc>This license of the children's TV show set it as a Ghosts 'N Goblins-style hack-n-slash adventure. The Thundercat must defeat Mumm-Ra's forces, which range from dwarves to bats. Although you start with only a sword, more can be collected by attacking the various containers through the levels - later weapons can destroy these enemies quicker, and allow attacks from a distance. Reaching the end of each level sees bonuses for time and kills. The path through the game can be varied on later levels, so you can play it through more than once and find new sections, even though the individual levels only scroll left-to-right.</desc>

		<desc>Thunderstrike is a 3d spaceship shooter set in the year 2238, using a non-textured polygon graphics engine. As a pilot in the "Ground Defense Games", you must make your way through several arenas built on different planets. You can choose from four different ships, each with different properties (better/worse acceleration, top speed, or turning speed).

When you enter the arena, you are given several pyramids that you must defend from robotic drones sent out to collapse them. In addition to defending your pyramids, you must destroy the spawning centers that spawn not only drones, but an array of robotic fighters to hunt you down.

When you destroy a fighter, sometimes it will leave behind an upgrade pod (shield, turbo, power, or twin-fire). There are also tracks that you can latch your ship onto to travel the perimeter of the arena quickly.

At the end of each round, your performance is reviewed, and if you did good, your ship is upgraded and you move on to the next round.</desc>

		<desc>This tennis simulation uses a top-down scrolling perspective. You are not in control of the player's motion, but once he gets close to the ball, shot selection is down to you. Standard shots plus topspin, lobs and stop volleys are available, by pushing the joystick in the right direction as you aim the shot.

The game supports up to 16 players in singles matches on a variety of court surfaces. It includes all of the major world tournaments - the four Grand Slam events at Melbourne, Roland Garros, Wimbledon and New York, plus the Davis Cup and Masters events. An early attempt at TV-style coverage is offered.</desc>

		<desc>Tiger Road is a beat 'em up in which you (as Lee Wong) must rescue the village children from the evil Ryo Ken Oh. Many levels are horizontally scrolling, although with high ledges to jump onto and follow for a slightly different path. Magic urns containing improved weapons appear frequently. Most enemies are easy to attack and only need one hit to kill, although they come at you in large hordes. Once you get to the indoor sections you will find big enemies with the ability to kill you with one hit, in sections set on multiple levels complete with stairways.</desc>

		<desc>Level 9's answer to the Infocom's Zork, this trilogy includes Lords of Time, Red Moon, and The Price of Magik, all of which center around wizards and spells. Despite the name "trilogy" these games do not share the same plot thread. Lords of Time has the best plot in this series: you must journey through time to collect various objects to defeat the Lord of Time. Red Moon and Price of Magik have more mundane plots, but the spell-related puzzles keep things interesting.</desc>

		<desc>The game is a strategical puzzle action, where you have to eliminate the playfield filling it with the tiles of different colors until the time will be exhausted. Each playfield represents a certain period of the human evolution such as Prehistory, Crusades, Prohibition or Berlin Wall. On each level some animation takes place, and you should perform your goal until it logically finishes.

The tiles are triangles of different colors, sometimes combined in groups, appear in one corner of the playfield and should be put in another place based on the player's strategy in the way to do not block the path for other tiles. When four triangle tiles with adjacent tiles of different colors formed a square, this square will be eliminated from playfield with its part and no tiles may be placed or moved here. Adjacent tiles of the same colors will be eliminated from playfield, but playfield will remain untouched. Tiles may be moved on the playfield and rotated over the center of the square. Also playfield may include different obstacles, which may influence on moving/rotation of your tiles to make it more difficult, and they should be avoided in any possible way.

Finishing the level will give you the code, which may be used later to access this level. There are 30 levels available to play.</desc>

		<desc>Time Scanner is a pinball game. As usual, the goal is to keep the ball in the game by bouncing it back with the paddles. Hitting bumpers and other obstacles rewards points and completing a table requires mastering certain objectives which depend on the table on hand. Every table is divided into two parts with their own paddles: the game only scrolls if the ball goes down. The four tables are:

- Volcano: The winning condition is to spell the table's name by using the associated volcano lanes.
- Ruins: In the middle of the table there is a "collect ball" hole. If all targets were hit and two balls were collected in the hole, a special fire ball is set loose. The stage is won when bringing this ball into the hole.
- Saqqarah: This pyramid themed table also required spelling a name by knocking down targets and hitting a special hole.
- The last table introduces Breakout elements: the player needs to hit blocks to vaporize them.

The first three tables can be freely selected and the last one is unlocked by beating the other three.</desc>

		<desc>You are a Time Soldier, who is asked to rescue five warriors from different time periods: Sirius in the "Primitive Age", Laplace in the "Age of Rome", Dymos in "The World Wars", Alpha in the "Age of Rome", and Altair in "Future World". Each one of them is guarded by one of Gylend's henchmen, but to get to them, you must fight off other enemies that are specific to each time era. Some of these enemies will drop weapons that you can pick up and use. You can use several teleports scattered in each time era to travel to another.</desc>

		<desc>The Kingdom of Albereth was under attack of barbarian forces. King Valwyn drove the barbarians away, but was wounded in battles. Searching for a place where he could rest and restore his strength, he left the city - but never returned. Now, a new hero must rise and defend his homeland.

Times of Lore is an action game with light role-playing elements, which follows the adventures of a young warrior (strong barbarian, armored knight, or quick valkyrie) to assist a weakened kingdom from various threats, and to recover special Artifacts that once made the kingdom strong.

Gameplay consists of moving the protagonist in real-time (day and night) through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player character gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as he completes tasks and advances the plot. Conversations are handled through key phrases. Battles involve a few types of creatures (skeletons, orcs, rogues) of which there can be various flavors.</desc>

		<desc>On planet Agaris IV, two races fight for power on an endless war. When the Klutes and the Furfurians' dispute made their planet inhospitable, they needed a new battleground. Their troops where teleported to planet Earth, where everything, they discover, is 100 times bigger. Their battles are thus a small event there, taking place out of the attention of the humans.

Tiny Troops is a real-time strategy game, with gameplay similar to Cannon Fodder. It supports up to 2 players in split-screen mode, and mouse or joystick control. Before starting a level, a screen is shown where the player must select which units are going to be on his troop. There's several types of units (foot soldiers, grenadiers, etc). Clicking the general gives a hint and the main objective of the level (that usually is about killing the enemy and destroying their base). Most of the main game screen is occupied by a scrolling map of the level, with the bottom portion reserved for the control windows (one for the mini-map, other for game options like saving and restarting, a third for unit commands and a final one with unit information or a list of group formations). The player controls the soldiers by clicking on them and selecting orders icons from the command window:

- a fist icon is to attack;

- an upward arrow to select the route;

- a wrench to repair things;

- a shield to stand guard;

- a target to surround the unit.

The game has 65 levels spread on a variety of different terrains (garden, kitchen, etc).

		<desc>7-year-old Tom and his mother are visiting the old castle in Scotland, while evil sorcerer kidnapped the mother. Tom was very upset, but the brave ghost Sir Reginald Arrow appears to help Tom. Evil sorcerer kidnapped his beloved 500 years ago to sacrifice her for Lucifer. Tom's mother may become the last victim in the sequence of dark ritual, and Sir Arrow has only 24 hours to stop the ritual and free Tom's mother. 

In the game you are controlling Sir Arrow. He may walk; jump; duck; use weapon; collect, combine and use items. Tom is near, but he should be kept in good mood. He may help you to beat monsters, but his energy is exhausting and he should be fed with Hamburgers and Milkshakes. When he is upset, you should give him a Teddy Bear. All such items as well as many others required to progress in the game such as different weapons, magic harp, or lighter, etc. are scattered within the castle. The huge doors either keep bonus items increasing your score, or monsters, or clues to solve the riddles. Tom may walk on his own, and you should blow in whistle to call him back and do not loose him. 

Many enemies are trying to get your life energy out, so kill or avoid them. Do not loose Tom, keep an eye on his stats, and do not allow to scare him to death. Just find his mother, and revenge for all the victims.</desc>

		<desc>Football simulation game featuring the likeness and strategic advice of legendary coach Tom Landry. You'll take the role of a new coach for the team of your picking who gets mentored by Mr. Landry himself along your career.

The game allows you to modify and customize your team to enhance its strengths, manage the acquisition of new players and perform general management tasks. Come game time the game takes away all the menus and windows and puts you in a side-scrolling view of the stadium from which you can watch the game take place. At any time you may issue offensive or defensive formations and make substitutions to try and indirectly affect the outcome of the game. 

Features VCR-style controls to speed up or pause the action and any time and an ubiquitous on-line hint and help system in the form of an "Ask Landry" window in which you can consult him on any aspect of American football coaching.</desc>

		<desc>This third-person racing game resembles Gremlin's earlier Lotus series, in terms of its general look and feel, right down to the text font used in the game. Your task is to race through 16 countries, each of which features four races, with many real-world circuits recreated in incongruous locations (such as the Monza layout in Ayers Rock, and the old Hockenheim in Vancouver).

These four-race blocks each represent their own mini-championship, in which you race against 19 cars, needing to finish in the top 10 to continue, and with the top 6 scoring points 10-6-4-3-2-1, and the respective amount of money in thousands. This can be spent on various upgrades, ranging from engine to tires (wet and dry) and from shocks (front, side and rear) to gearboxes. The ideal approach is to buy the more expensive versions ASAP, as you get no saving when upgrading. If you win the four-race championship, you get the next password.

You get a set amount of nitro boost to use during each race, although bonus nitros, money and instant speed-up token appear on many tracks. Hazards such as puddles, barriers and ramps are also frequent.</desc>

		<desc>Top Secret is a platform game played out on individual screens, each with a number of disks to collect. There are various enemies on the screen, which must be hit a number of times to be stopped. The ground-based creatures can then be walked over for points, while the birds simply stop for a few seconds. Your weapons have an arc similar to Kid Gloves, meaning that they hit the ground then rebound to a lower height, making precision aiming important. 

The level layouts are similar to Rodland, with gaps between platforms, and your character glides in a similar way - some of the disks are suspended in mid-air, and you must control the character's fall to pass over these - thankfully your character isn't harmed by falling. A number of bonus items are on offer, including extra points, extra lives and invincibility.</desc>

		<desc>Torvak, a man with the typical barbarian looks, comes back to his homeland after an exile of five years. But instead of a warm greeting, he receives a telepathic message that an evil necromancer took over. So of course the next course of action is to travel through five levels while killing all of the necromancer's creatures on the way, including an especially nasty one at each level's end. 

The levels are generally side-scrolling, but sometimes underground passages can be reached via holes. This has no significant effect, though. The gameplay consists of using the four melee weapons which three moves each to get rid of the enemies without dying from their hits. Helpful power ups can be found when destroying parts of the scenery. Besides health refreshments and invincibility, there are also permanent upgrades for Torvak available, e.g. an extended health bar, greater speed or magical enchantments for the weapons. When an upgraded weapon is equipped, a powerful spell can be unleashed by holding the fire button.</desc>

		<desc>Doug Quaid is a mild-mannered construction worker with a gorgeous wife in an apartment on futuristic Earth. Plagued by restless feelings and dreams of Mars, he heads to Rekall, Inc. to purchase a commercial memory implant of a Martian vacation 'cheaper, better, and safer than the real thing'. However, the implant procedure uncovers latent memories of Quaid's real life as a secret agent for the Martian government. Pursued relentlessly by his former employers, Quaid must fight from Earth to Mars in a battle to reclaim his past and secure his future.

Total Recall for the Amiga and has players controlling Quaid as he fights through seven levels on Earth and Mars. The game alternates between platforming levels and driving levels. Platforming levels require Quaid to fight guards and find the exit. The player may duck to avoid bullets and fight back with both captured weapons and meaty Schwarzenegger fists. The first level requires the player to locate items to open the exit, and a later level has the player switching control between Quaid and resistance fighter Melina to solve a puzzle.

Driving levels are high-speed side-scrolling runs, with the player's vehicle moving at a fixed speed. The player must dodge passing traffic, or blow them apart with weapons. If they survive to the end, they must defeat a mobile boss vehicle to end the level. Cutscenes appear between certain levels that tell the plot of the movie and set up the next scene.</desc>

		<desc>The Toyottes is a really fun looking game, but unfortunately, the graphics are the best thing about it. Quite humorous graphics can draw you into the game. An average use of colour, but the backdrops are pretty bland. Couple this with lots going on, and you get a very confusing play. Also some good music, with a good variety of sound effects during the game. Overall, they add to the humour of the graphics quite well. The basic idea is pretty good, and fighting the various monsters is quite fun, but once you've seen most of the screens and baddies the game loses its addictiveness and appeal. As far as platform games go, Toyottes isn't that great and not really something I can recommend.</desc>

		<desc>The Viking Union has a very dominant role in your society, as they control the vast railway networks. Could they be to blame for the disappearance of the sun and the resultant ice age? As a train captain, you must find out and overthrow them.

Transarctica is a strategic trading and combat game. You must keep your train running and make sure there is enough fuel. When you reach towns you can trade with local people, with each city having a primary function. These towns often contain useful information to put you on the right track in your mission. You are in possession of slaves, who are traded just like other commodities.

Contact with other trains results in combat. Buy upgrades to boost your performance in combat, to increase your chance of fending off the Viking Union.</desc>

		<desc>After recreating the original board game as closely as possible with the first licensed game, Oxford did something different with the sequel. Each player now controls a spaceship, and the overall aim is to convince the Elders of the planet Genus to accept your people's plan to colonize it.

The Elders are all located in different parts of the galaxy, and can only be reached by travelling through the galaxy answering questions correctly, and answering a specific question once you get there. As a result, the gameplay isn't vastly different from the original. 

The six question categories are the same as the original, and there are 50 levels of question to clear, but the big difference is that the question category is random, so players who are only knowledgeable in one or two areas are no longer at an advantage.</desc>

		<desc>This is the second game Dave parsons wrote for the Amiga. It is a fairly short, sideways-scrolling game in the Wonderboy style. It uses pixel-perfect collision detection routines and runs in 32-colour mode. It was revisited later and made into a much more colourful [AGA version](/amiga/trog-aga) which has 64 colours, much smoother sky colours and screen fades, and a 1-bit parallax background layer.</desc>

		<desc>Isn't life full of surprises? Last month, there was us thinking that Flair's Dangerous Streets had to be the last word in awesomely awful beat 'em-ups but no!  here comes Tube Warriors all set to make us rethink just how bad games can get. The big pity with Tube Warriors is that the basic engine for an excellent Street Fighter 2 clone  or even a perfect conversion of the coin-op itself  is in place. Trouble is, it's obvious that having written it the programmers have no idea what to do with it. The backdrops, for example, move as nicely as any in Street Fighter, with loads of top foreground and background parallax effects, but they're just so drab and unexciting to look at. Likewise, the fighters are poorly drawn (something of an understatement, to be honest) and stiffly animated, but they bounce around swiftly enough. Now I could live with ropey graphics if the gameplay was any good but, to be blunt, it's a mess. The joystick control is sheer crap; if you simply want to walk left and right you have to make the character take each step by tapping the joystick in the required direction, so you can imagine what a nightmare the combat moves are to pull off. There are many other things I could go on about &amp;#8212; the crude presentation, the fact that you can't choose your character in one player mode, the duff sound &amp;#8212; but I think you get the idea. I took this home to review over the weekend and even my girlfriend, who still thinks Space Invaders is advanced computer entertainment, recognised it as crap. Stay well away for fear of contamination.</desc>

		<desc>One of the most popular game genres in the late 80' and the early 90's so a bit unusual to see this kind of game made in 1994. Tubular Worlds doesn't offer anything new and in my opinion it looks like Dongleware was a bit too late with getting this game published since they missed the general game market with a few years.

Apart from that Tubular Worlds is a well developed game offering the usual side scroller interface where the entire goal in the game is to shoot up as many enemies as possible. The more you shoot the better your spaceship gets. You can get better weapons, faster movement and other great improvements. The game consists of many different enemies and also multiple levels so there are many hours of game play.

Overall a nice side scroller but both the graphics and sound could have been better considering the age of this game. Of course this is not the most important in a game and the developers have programmed with this on their mind.</desc>

		<desc>Turbo is a traditional top-view scroller, much in the spirit of Spy Hunter. It can be played against the clock, which is enormous but short-duration fun, against another player, which is enormously enormous fun, or over a comms link, which is critically unreliable according the publishers.

The excuse for a scenario is set in the uncomfortably near future. For no adequately explained reason, the populace have decided that commuting is dull and every other vehicle and pedestrian is fair game. Some unknown character has strewn the road with bolt-on goodies, all designed to get yourself noticed. Missiles and grenades fire forwards, the only differences being speed and range. Oil causes anything behind you to lose control, while hub spikes knock out the competition at the sides. Closet kamikazes are also catered for with the turbo wheels, which allow extreme speed at the expense of any control whatsoever.

The graphics work, the sound is suitably grotesque and the whole thing is presented with the panache of a dead stoat. But it is such manic fun to play that that all goes out of the window. If I had to describe Turbo as glibly as possible, I would go about it this: Audio-Visual Jadedness is the disease, Turbo is the cure.</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;Out Run takes you on a 16 stage race across America. Along the way 
&amp;gt;you will battle bumper to bumper with good guys and bad guys, police 
&amp;gt;cars, Porsches and blown engines. Numerous scenes will take you through 
&amp;gt;congested city streets, over snow and icy mountain passes and across 
&amp;gt;sunbaked deserts. Drive daytime and night time - go for manual or auto 
&amp;gt;gearbox selection, even customise your Ferrari F40 with High Grip 
&amp;gt;Tyres, but whatever else you do... use the Turbo booster power 
&amp;gt;sparingly - THIS BABY'S HOT AND RARING TO GO!! TURBO OUT RUN "NO 
&amp;gt;OTHER CAR RACING GAME COMES CLOSE."
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;




***Turbo Out Run*** is a 1989 arcade racing game released by Sega. A 
follow-up to 1986's Out Run, it was released as a dedicated game, as 
well as an upgrade kit for the original Out Run board.




Like it predecessor, Turbo OutRun has players driving a Ferrari, this 
time a Ferrari F40. Players now traverse a set route across the entire 
continental United States from New York City to Los Angeles instead of 
the branching paths of the first game. In addition to a time limit, 
Turbo OutRun also adds a computer-controlled opponent driving a 
Porsche 959. The "Turbo" in the title also plays a factor as players 
can now press a button to receive a brief turbo boost of speed. 
Various power-ups which increase the vehicle's attributes can now be 
chosen at various stages of the game.




Ports of Turbo OutRun were released for personal computers, as well 
as Sega's own Master System and Mega Drive.

		<desc>Finding the mysterious Elephant's Graveyard in Africa was your Father's lifelong quest. When he disappears you are determined to find out what might have happened to him, and what secrets may lie within.

This side-scrolling action game is split into three stages, taking in the harsh and barren desert, an underground network of caves, and a tough tribal jungle. The natives are hostile to your presence, and weaponry must be found to fend them off, although its use does little to put the natives at ease initially. The machete to cut through the jungle is equally important. At many other points you will need to use objects you have found along the way. The backgrounds are in full 3D and can serve to obscure the character when he is behind trees or rocks.</desc>

		<desc>After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named Exodus before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him.

The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons. This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.</desc>

		<desc>The Avatar, the embodiment of the Eight Virtues and the hero of Britannia, is called back to deal with a grave threat. Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.

Ultima V uses the basics of the Ultima IV engine, an overhead perspective for the map of Britannia and its towns, and a rosette-compass 3D view for the dungeons. The battle system also resembles that of the previous game, with separate battle screens and navigation of character icons in turn-based style. Many of the gameplay elements of the predecessor return, including the complex spell system (reagents must be bought in order to cast spells), recruitable party members, moongates that teleport the party between locations, various means of transportation (horses, ships, etc., with the notable addition of a magic carpet), and so on. Character creation based on morally ambiguous questions and basic leveling up system have been preserved as well. In comparison to the predecessor, the classes have been reduced to four.

Additional challenges include navigating characters through the Underworld, a vast underground area containing many hazards; random presence of Shadowlords in the cities, which influences the behavior of their inhabitants, making them run away, steal from, or attack the Avatar; inscriptions in a runic alphabet that must be deciphered by the player, and others.

The game has a noticeably more detailed world than any of its predecessors; the towns are much larger, with many unique buildings and objects represented graphically. Ultima V introduces physical interaction with the game world: many objects can be pushed or pulled, the main character can sit down on a chair (which is graphically shown), etc. It also incorporates a day/night cycle and schedules for non-playable characters: for example, it is impossible to shop at night because the shopkeepers are sleeping. Dialogues with NPCs have been enhanced, featuri</desc>

		<desc>UMS (Universal Military Simulator) attempts to cover the ground of games like Empire and go beyond, simulating almost every aspect of warfare in a realistic manner. Battles can range from ancient history to a science-fiction future, with famed battled such as Gettysburg and the Battle of Hastings built in. The view system operates at multiple levels, from a single unit up to the whole theater.

However, there is no naval element whatsoever and the design pays little attention to extremely important wargaming concepts like fog of war.

The game spawned a sequel, UMS II.</desc>

		<desc>Under Pressure is a 2D side scrolling arcade game. The player controls a robot (he is trapped inside) and tries to rescue kidnapped gal. Gameplay is simplistic - he goes into right side, avoid obstacles like lasers barriers, and kill alien creatures. Sometimes he needs to hurry - for example, when the floor collapses. Killed enemies drop shells, the player can collect them for new weapons.

The game uses big animated sprites, for this reason, the player sees only the immediate environment.</desc>

		<desc>Universal Warrior (or The Machines, as is the official title of the PC version) is a top-down maze shooter in the vein of Gauntlet and Alien Breed, with added economic elements.

The game alternates between equipment management and the actual in-level action, in which a remote-controlled robot runs through maze-like maps and shoots mechanical enemies. With the money earned in these sci-fi contests, improved equipment can be bought in five categories, making the robot more powerful, more maneuverable and less easy to damage. On the other hand, getting damaged means you must spend money on repairs. This encourages careful and effective playing.

The game can be played solo, competitively in two-player hot-seat mode or cooperatively in split-screen mode.

The Amiga and the PC version of the game have the same basic design, but entirely different levels. For a comprehensive list of differences between the versions see the trivia section.</desc>

		<desc>Unlike the first two games in the series, which fell into the roleplaying and resource-management category, Universe 3 poses true logic-based puzzles for you to solve. Your characters move about in much the same way as their counterparts in Breach, Omnitrend's tactical combat RPG. 

You set out to escort a diplomat on a trip to the hyperspace booster (a key element of Universe 2) to investigate the disappearance of shipments from Earth to this remote corner of the star map. The story takes a quick twist when you and your crew are captured, forcing you to rack up some criminal charges during your escape. You'll spend the rest of your time looking for evidence about the missing shipments, which will clear you of the charges as well as wrap up the mystery.</desc>

		<desc>This one on one future sport combines ideas from a number of real-world competitions, most notably the schoolgirl favourite Netball (I wonder why the ad blurb makes no mention of this?). The action is viewed isometrically, so moving the joystick up moves your droid north-east, down moves south-west, and so on.

The aim is to score more points than your opponent in each match, and be the first to win four matches (against either a human or computer opponent), before moving up to the next difficulty level. There is a goal in the middle at each end, and the ball can be advanced by shooting it (the length of a shot is affected by pushing the joystick up or down with fire pressed) as you can't run with the ball, or hold onto it for long. The main novel idea in the game is the shaping of the pitches, which are viewed in full 3D and have bumps and big divots all around.</desc>

At the start of the game you have $500 to bet with. The betting limits are $200 for Black Jack and Roulette and $5 for Video Poker and Slots. Once you have placed a bet you only need to hit play, the computer will automatically bet the same amount of money again and again, however if you play roulette you have to manually place your bet on the game board. Once you run out of money you may chose between borrowing another $500 or quit. The game features a save/load function for one game.</desc>

		<desc>For any space pilot, The Fortresses contain all the wealth any man could imagine so men have tried and many have failed. The few who have succeeded enjoyed the wealth but that amount turned them crazy and protective of the wealth and so became guardians of the four fortresses. You are a wealthy experienced pilot looking for that one last challenge, so you are determined to fly your ship and conquer it all, not for the money, just because it's there. If the going gets too tough you can change into an eagle for a short time, you are invulnerable but you can't fire.

Venom Wing is a side scrolling shoot-em-up where the screen scrolls automatically over four levels. Levels one and three have you gradually scrolling downwards before facing an end of level boss. Levels two and four are more traditional horizontal scrolling from left to right before facing them end of level bosses again. There are various power-up icons to collect including triple fire, a drone to fly with you and one to change into the eagle.</desc>

You take control of the fly, shooting out the mutated creatures and plants. You must get through 8 worlds, including Frozen Wastes, Caverns and Death Valley.

Most sentient creatures release a ball when killed; shoot this to release one of many features such as enhanced weaponry, faster movement, an extra life, or negative ones like losing a life or having your controls reversed. As the game progresses the levels become more intricate and platform-based.</desc>

		<desc>Imagine being teleported into five diverse movie worlds - Medieval, Wild West, Science-Fiction, Gangster and Horror, and having to fight your way out. That's the situation which befalls couch-potato Billy when a new video recorder malfunctions.

Gameplay has some similarities to Mega Twins, with multi-directional scrolling through each level. Billy must face (amongst other things) knights and gargoyles in Medieval world, cowboys and then Indians in the Wild West, spaceships and aliens in Sci-Fi world, biplanes and squad cars in 1930s Chicago, and ghosts and skeletons in horror world.

Fortunately many upgrades to your initial missiles are available, with the laser being the best of all. These weapons can be upgraded to fire in more directions, with smart bombs and shields also available.</desc>

		<desc>The Tangent Empire are preparing to attack the earth with their convoy of tanks, and it is you who has been sent forward to destroy the 14 space stations which make up the potential invasion threat.

There are 3 sub-levels on each station, which can be played in any order. The action scrolls in every direction, with you guiding your tank-link droid around to shoot the opposition droids. The tank takes a while to steer, making it initially harder to avoid contact with those enemies. Each level contains energy stars, which can be traded in for upgrades such as improved weapons and extra speed after each level.</desc>

		<desc>Walker is classic 2D shooter with the side-scrolling from the right to the left. Player takes control of gigantic robot AG-9 (codename Walker). The mission is simple - guide Walker through the four time zones and kill everybody/destroy everything. Every zone is also divided into two parts. The road is full of trained enemies with one single purpose - to destroy Walker. However, except relative immunity, the robot is equipped with twin 30mm carbines cannons. The number of enemies are actually huge, they are attacking in groups, off the ground and from the air. Also, every time zone consist of special types of enemies which force player to stay alert. As usual, there is a powerful boss at the end of level (luckily each boss has its own weak spot).</desc>

		<desc>Wanted is a vertically scrolling shooter with a Western theme, similar to Gunsmoke. The player takes the role of a bounty hunter who has to bring four desperadoes to justice. They can be tackled in any order and if all are defeated, a fifth level emerges. The gameplay offers no surprises: shooting masses of enemies until reaching the end of the level. The player can shoot barrels to receive extras, e.g. boots for extra speed or a rifle for a better range. Dynamite destroys every enemy on the screen.</desc>

		<desc>A third game in the tank combat series, following from Team Yankee (whose story and setting came from a book) and Pacific Islands (set in an imaginary 1995 war). The third game imagines a situation in which Iraq invades Kuwait for a second time. 

The series' main distinguishing feature was the way you always viewed all 4 tanks in a platoon at the same time, via a split screen. Action here is purely mouse-driven. The AI has been significantly updated from previous games in the series. A full roster of tanks and weapons are included, with Iraq mainly using Soviet machinery. A major consideration involves destroying particular buildings for money, and preventing other particular ones being destroyed, also for financial reasons.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2045, The Earth was attacked by aliens from Sirius. Looking like insects and believed to be related with the insect life forms known to humans, the Sirians have shown no mercy: a third of human population was annihilated. This assault led to the dissolution of all political borders on the Earth. The humans have united to defend themselves against the common enemy. An organisation called the Fist of Earth was formed to defend the planet, its most important military base, the SolBase, built in the orbit. The Fist of Earth sends a fighter pilot navigating the FOE-57 spacecraft on a series of missions to stop the Sirians and protect humanity.

Warhead is a mission-based space combat simulation. Objectives include destroying enemies, protecting friendly forces, as well as search and.rescue missions. The player proceeds to the next mission after having completed the preceding one. The space ship is navigated with the mouse; the keyboard controls offer autopilot modes, multiple weapons including mines and stinger missiles, an HUD display, multiple viewpoints, targeting and navigation, all of which must be used during combat.</desc>

		<desc>Wayne Gretzky Hockey 2 is a top-down hockey game. The player participates in a match against either Canada or the USA. There are many options to change the match settings, e.g. the difficulty level, speed or the referee's behaviour. The editor offers the possibility to create new tactics or lineups as well as changing the abilities and names of the athletes. In contrast to most other sports games, the athletes are controlled indirectly: the player uses the input device to show the athlete where he should move. The active athlete can be changed. 

This is basically the same game as its predecessor. The main additions are additional match options and a co-op playing mode.</desc>

		<desc>This point and click adventure takes a fantasy setting, in which you play a Wizard deemed to be good' taking on a less good one. To fulfill the prophecy you have been given in a limited time of 3 days, he must go on 3 quests, solving various puzzles along the way to be rewarded 3 grains of sand, that he must place in a hourglass to kill an evil wizard. Objects around the levels are always detected by the cursor, making each screen and the challenges within quick to comprehend. Generally you have to solve each puzzle in sequence.

Like the company's Gobliins Series, the interface is simplified, and the game has a heavier focus on self-sufficient puzzles than other traditional adventures. The game experiments with the toning of the graphics, using a faux-sepia style outside and some bright colours inside, which changes the atmosphere somewhat.</desc>

		<desc>This game came as a pack-in title with Loriciel's light gun controller of the same name. Most light guns opted for a futuristic look and feel, but the West Phaser was inspired more by 19th century Colt revolvers, and aptly enough the bundled game was a Western-themed shooter - with similar mechanics to Operation Wolf, except for the stationary screens.

Up to six players can pick their characters from a Who's Who of the American Old West: Doc Holliday, Calamity Jane, Will Bill Hickok, and every other big-name lawman and gunfighter in collective imagination. Outlaws like Jesse James, Billy the Kid and Belle Starr are sowing terror in the murky saloons and dusty streets, and it's your job to stop them if you're after that coveted Sheriff's badge... or the big fat rewards on their heads.

Each location throws wave after wave of humorously-drawn attackers at you - bandits, cowboys, Indians, Mexicans, all thrown together into a big pile of cartoonish violence. A burning candle represents your life bar and there's plenty of enemies trying to snuff it out, so you'll have to be quick on the draw (but don't forget to protect the innocent). When the face of the bandit you're after starts blinking on the status bar, prepare for the showdown: nail them and the reward is yours.

Apparently the light gun was not the biggest success, and less than three years later the game was re-released, this time with support for other input devices - and a new title, Steve McQueen: Westphaser, despite having exactly nothing to do with any of McQueen's characters.</desc>

		<desc>Following on from Brutal Sports Football came this interpretation of soccer, released alongside the 1994 World Cup. In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single &amp;#8216;Unfriendly' matches.

Unlike its predecessor, the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a &amp;#8216;Penalty Shoot Out', which involves going round shooting the opposition;- the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.</desc>

		<desc>New-York, Year 1998. The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone. Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy.

The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by "The Boss", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops.

On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped "The Boss" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful.


Your mission is to liberate "The Boss" and to bring him back safely. You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where "The Boss" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely.

You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful.

In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights. Once you reach the point where "The Boss"</desc>

Farming, ranching, mining, and hunting, are all methods for generating cash to buy land and build your economic empire. Employees of various trades must be hired, farms, ranches, and mines established, and all must be kept supplied with livestock, food, and tools. Eventually, the only way to grow, will be to play dirty tricks on your competition, which include the hire of a gang of outlaws to harass or eliminate them, to bribe Indians to burn them out and kill their workers, and more.</desc>

		<desc>Wild Wheels is an action game in which two teams of five cars each try to bring a ball into other team's goal for points (more points are awarded for risky moves) and destroying all enemy cars. The player takes control over a single car which can be shown in various camera positions, most prominently directly behind the vehicle or top-down. There are also special fields on the field which grant advantages when passed. 

The single-player portion basically consists of a series of elimination matches with the goal to win all leagues of increasing difficulty levels. Between matches, the points earned with goals can be reinvested into new cars with better statistics - additionally they are also divided into five categories with different roles during the matches. The game features two control modes: in professional mode the player rotates the car when pushing left or right while arcade mode allows direct turns.</desc>

		<desc>This is a winter sports game that lets you compete in five Olympic events: Downhill skiing, Biathlon, Slalom, Ski Jump and Bob Sled. It is very similar to offerings like Winter Games from Epyx.

In Downhill skiing, you must avoid the obstacles and make it to the bottom of the hill, by swerving left and right and adjusting your speed by pushing the joystick forward and back. The Slalom is similar, involving skiing around flags.

In the ski jump, you must position the skis for a proper landing. In the bobsled event, you must carefully control the angles so your bobsled doesn't flip. The Biathlon event combines skiing to shooting ranges and shooting the targets archery-style.</desc>

		<desc>Alice was sitting at the river bank with her sister and got drowsy. Suddenly, she sees a white rabbit who was hurrying somewhere, muttering something to himself. Curious, Alice follows the rabbit into a hole that leads into a bizarre world populated by strange and exotic creatures. Alice has to use her wits in order to understand Wonderland's twisted laws of logic, and figure out a way to return home.

Wonderland is a text adventure with graphics, based on Lewis Carroll's classic novel Alice in Wonderland. The game follows the book's general story, while adding many descriptions, locations and puzzles of its own. The interaction with the environment is done mostly by typing; however, commands may also appear in pop-up menus and can be selected by the player. Sometimes puzzles need to be solved in order to be able to advance. The game features windows with adjustable size, separating graphical display from inventory, command interface, text descriptions, and other options.</desc>

		<desc>Woody is an elf who has to retrieve a magical crystal which was stolen by evil forces. To do so, he has to travel through six worlds with overall 60 levels. The game plays out as a regular platformer in which Woody walks through the level, collects power-ups, avoids obstacles (e.g. blocks with nail traps or others which crash when touched) and defeats enemies by jumping on their head.</desc>

		<desc>World Class Soccer is a soccer (football) game that ties in with the 1990 football World Cup. The game uses a top-down perspective for matches and features the full World Cup structure and all the 24 teams who were involved. Multiple formations and team selections are available before each match. The ball sticks to the feet of the players, who can be tackled either by doing a block tackle, or attempting a slide tackle, which risks giving away a foul. Matches can vary between 4 and 90 minutes, and each player has differing skills and behaviour style depending on his team's relative ability.</desc>

		<desc>World Cup 90 is a soccer game capitalizing the event of World Cup of 1990 in Italy. All the national teams participating at the event are included; however, due to the lack of a license, the players' names are fictional. The player can create custom teams (name, tactics and color of the jersey) and change the team's roster. Multiplayer features two players mode (1 vs. 1 or 2 vs. CPU), and through additional interface, it is possible to add other two players.</desc>

		<desc>Viewed from above, the task in each level of X-It is to create a path to walk through to the exit, by moving blocks around a walled arena. The movement physics are fairly true to real life - most blocks can only be pushed if there is a block's worth of space behind them, and nothing immediately ahead of them.   The levels are full of gaps, through which blocks can be pushed - this has the double effect of freeing up extra room in the level, and allowing you to walk over those spaces. Other hazards include ice which prevents blocks from stopping until they go past it. Falling through holes loses you one of your 3 lives - you also have 5 attempts at each screen.</desc>

		<desc>X-Out is a horizontally scrolling shoot-'em-up. Unlike most comparable games (e.g. R-Type), the game is not set in outer space or even in the air - instead, the fight between good and evil is underwater.

Through five levels, the player has to shoot countless enemies, complete with the obligatory mid-level and end-level bosses. After having completed a level, the player gets to purchase new weapons; instead of simply buying upgrades, it is possible to customize the ship by placing new weapons anywhere on it.</desc>

		<desc>Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.</desc>

		<desc>Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.

The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.</desc>

		<desc>As usual, a computer has been put in control of vast stretches of an intergalactic empire. As usual, it has failed and locked the entire area into limbo. As usual, you're the one who has to sort this mess out, by reaching the computer and destroying it.  Unfortunately, the area en route to it is vast and treacherous, with lots of obstacles to shoot out, and you will need to trade your items in order to get enough fuel to get there.  The gameplay resembles Elite, involving first-person space shooting and trading.</desc>

		<desc>All the toys in the World have been stolen by the Greed Monster, so Top Cat has sent Yogi's Treasure Hunters to find them all. Problem is, all the hunters have been captured by the monster except Yogi, so it's up to Yogi to find his friends and all the toys. The game is a flick-screen maze game viewed from a high elevated angle as you control Yogi. You have to search the surrounding areas looking for your friends and toys while avoiding or shooting various creatures. You are armed with sweets to shoot the creatures but these are limited. If you are touched by a creature or certain obstacles then you lose part of a food gauge and when this is empty then it is game over. As well as the toys and your friends, there are other items that can be collected and they are coloured keys to open the same coloured door, cans of pop to double your speed, extra sweets and jars of honey to make you invincible for a limited period. Bubble gum needs avoiding as these will stick you to the spot for a limited time.</desc>

On one search, Yogi over hears an awful telephone conversation with Ranger Smith that the Park is closing and all animals must be caught and transferred to a zoo. Not wanting to live in a cage or enclosure, Yogi has decided to escape and thus the beginning of his adventure. You have to guide Yogi over six levels (ending in New York) keeping ahead of a tracker and his dog.</desc>

		<desc>The 16-bit box calls this The Ultimate Challenge' and they're not kidding; this flick-screen platform game is one of the toughest you'll come across. In the 8-bit versions Hercules has some titanic tasks to complete, whilst in the 16-bit versions his daughter Yolanda has been cursed and can only free herself by completing the same tasks.  Unusually, the game's dozens of screens are given in a random order, with a different one after you lose each life. You have no weapon with which to harm the various creatures that lurk within. The pace of the enemies is quite hectic, but the real unique feature is that you must keep moving - each platform is set on fire a few seconds after you first touch it.</desc>

		<desc>Like its predecessor X-Out, Z-Out is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up. A horde of largely-organic enemies threaten the safety of your planet, and they must be destroyed over the course of six levels.There are power-ups available, but the game is less centered around these than some are. 

Whilst some shoot 'em ups are much easier with a second player, Z-Out takes design steps to legislate against this. In a 2-player game, most power-ups are unavailable, and even those which are only come into effect on level 3. Another variation is that the 1-player mode uses restart points, but the 2-player mode does not, so as to keep both players in the same place.</desc>

		<desc>Zak McKracken is a tabloid reporter (and not a very good one at that). After having a psychedelic dream one day, Zak realizes that something is wrong -- space aliens are dumbifying the general public through the telephone system. Zak must stop this, but he can't do it alone. After finding a strange crystal, Zak manages to get the help of the anthropologist Annie and her friends, Melissa and Leslie. The four unlikely heroes must now figure out a way to destroy the dumbifying devices and save the Earth.

Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure similar in gameplay to Lucasfilm's breakthrough title Maniac Mansion. The player chooses verb commands (Open, Pick Up, Give, etc.; there are no Look or Talk commands) to interact with the game world. The game features up to four controllable protagonists; it is possible to switch between them at any time after they have been introduced, and also exchange inventory items if the characters are in the same location. The game can be described as a "globe-trotting" adventure, since the heroes are required to travel to different exotic countries and even leave the Earth for a while in order to complete it. Some of the puzzles are optional or can be solved in different ways.</desc>

		<desc>Zarathrusta is a cave-flying game influenced by Thrust. Apparently, the resistance forces have captured a number of space ships, which could aid in the struggle against the empire. However, these ships need fuel, and that fuel is find in the form of "klystron pods", which must be recovered from a range of hostile environments.   Your task is to fly your small spaceship above and below ground, capturing the pods. Your spaceship can rotate in 360 degrees, allowing for easy movements through the cave systems, if it wasn't for gravity pulling you down, and inertia, which means you could crash into walls or other objects if you don't turn around and thrust in the other direction.</desc>

		<desc>Binary Asylum's final release puts you in control of a helicopter, and sets you 32 missions to complete. The level structures involve different military objectives, of protecting or destroying a particular area. The surprise is in the graphics - patchwork-quilt style landscapes and a remote view, reminiscent of Virus. The game offers joystick and mouse control options, as well as sections in which you must direct ships and planes. A range of weapons are offered, with resupply ships on the water to dock with.</desc>

The main twist is that the gameplay is completely 3-dimensional, with control over the horizontal and vertical positions of the bat. The game uses a split-screen view, with the top half viewed from the perspective of Player 1, and the bottom from that of Player 2, even when only one of them is human.</desc>

		<desc>Ziriax is a side-scrolling futuristic "shoot-'em-up" set in a futuristic environment, similar to R-Type. The player controls a spaceship-like aircraft that is trying to survive amidst the fire of hostile ships and other enemies. There are five stages in the game altogether; each contains a fight against a boss enemy at the end. Small spheres are dropped by enemies; collecting these spheres bestows the player-controlled ship with various power-ups. These include two additional small ships above and below the main one, an ability to shoot backwards, and missiles that can be shot diagonally.</desc>

		<desc>&amp;gt;The nightmare has just begun. For mysterious reasons, dead people came 
&amp;gt;back to life to feed themselves on the flesh of human being. The Earth 
&amp;gt;is inhabited by millions of Zombies, who are spreading terror, and by 
&amp;gt;gangs of hooligans, who are ready to anything to survive.




&amp;gt;Yet four people didn't lose hope and decided to run away for new 
&amp;gt;horizons. 




&amp;gt;When there is no room left in Hell...




&amp;gt;...dead people come back to Earth.
&amp;gt; -- &amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;Game Box&amp;lt;/cite&amp;gt;




***Zombi*** is an icon-driven arcade adventure video game. It was 
Ubisoft's first publication, released when the company was established 
in 1986.




A first-person arcade adventure, it draws inspiration from the 
George A. Romero film Dawn of the Dead; the player controlling four 
protagonists exploring a zombie-filled shopping mall. It draws from 
many parts of the film, including the gun shops, the escalators, and 
the articulated trucks used to block the entrances. If a character's 
health is depleted, he turns into a zombie, which then roams the room 
they died in. Zombies can be killed either by numerous body shots, 
or a single shot to the head. Characters were named after the creators 
of the game.




The original Amstrad CPC version was programmed by Yannick Cadin and 
S.L. Coemelck, with graphics by Patrick Daher and music by Philippe 
Marchiset.




It was re-released in 1990, with ports developed for the ZX Spectrum 
(by Geoff Phillips, Colin Jones and Steve Chance), Commodore 64 
(Jean Noel Moyne, Laurent Poujoulat, Jean Francois Auroux), Amiga 
(Alexander Yarmitsky), Atari ST and DOS.




The ZX Spectrum version was awarded 87% by Sinclair User magazine and 
77% byYour Sinclair, both reviewers were impressed with the 
immersive atmosphere.




CU Amiga awarded the Amiga version of the game 85%, whilst German 
magazine Amiga Joker scored it at 69%.




Zzap!64 awarded the Commodore 64 version of the game 72%. The 
reviewer said that the gameplay is outdated and is very similar to 
Catch 23, a 1987 ZX Spectrum game.

		<desc>After Burner is an aircraft shooter. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</desc>

		<desc>Amberstar is a role-playing game which uses a top-down view for overworld travel and most indoor locations, and switches to a first-person pseudo-3D perspective when exploring cities and dungeons. Initially the player creates a single protagonist with randomly assigned attributes and no class designation. During the course of the game, additional characters (up to six active party members) can be found in different cities and other locations and recruited. Some of these characters already belong to established classes and come with their own abilities. Guilds of various classes (fighter, paladin, ranger, mage, monk, and thief) can be visited, where the protagonist and his class-less companions (if any) can be promoted. Choice of classes affects attributes, character growth, imposes equipment restrictions, etc. When leveling up, characters can train in specific locations, increasing attributes of the player's choice.</desc>

There are 11 different enemies to meet you, and Krauer, the Death Bringers leader who protects the ship and is 4 meters tall.

The game starts with a single shot, then the weapon is expanded over the game, we pick up weapons more and more powerful. Note that the contents of the crates sent from the sky by the Astro Marine can be changed by the Death Bringers, so you can die suffocated by green carnivorous plants.

Phase 2 of the game takes you to the Death Bringers ship that drops you on their planet, and you have to exterminate them in a limited time, and contains 13 different enemies and the end boss, Great King Alien.</desc>

		<name>Alien Breed (Story)</name>
		<desc>Alien Breed is a top-down science fiction shooter somewhat inspired by the movie Alien in terms of plot and atmosphere. Gameplay, though, was obviously inspired by the Atari arcade classic Gauntlet. The game tells a typical sci-fi story of an alien invasion on the space station ISRC-4. Two space marines, Johnson and Stone, are the only human beings left to clear the base of aliens.

Moving around an alien-infested complex in a top-down view, you must at all times keep an eye not only on your energy level, but also be conservative with ammunition. Though you will find new ammo cartridges strewn around the levels, they are consumed quickly by respawning aliens that may come crawling out of the floors and walls when you least expect it. On the floors, you will also find keys for passing through locked doors. Keys must also be used with care, or you may find yourself locked out of a room containing the remaining keys that you will need in order to complete the level. Other doors are one-way, and will electrocute you if you try to pass it in the other direction.</desc>

This release was in a similar vein, but set into a 3D context, making for the Amiga's first big Doom-style game. The 3D engine uses fairly small screen graphics, but these include full floors and ceilings with detailed shading, doors, vertical position variations, lifts and transporters. The CD version includes extra atmospheric sound, while fast processors and extra FastRAM are also supported.</desc>

		<name>Shadow of the Beast</name>
		<desc>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories. As the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes his father's face. As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.

Shadow of the Beast is a side-scrolling platformer. The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.</desc>

		<name>20000 Leagues under the Sea</name>
		<desc>The game is based on an 1870 novel by Jules Verne.

On July 5th, 1867 the government decided to launch the famous ship the "Abraham Lincoln", which will leave on the trail of a sea monster. The great French professor Mr. Arronax will also take part in the expedition. The weeks passed without any sign of the monster's presence in the area, when, one day, 300 miles from the shores of Queen Charlotte's Island... three members of the expedition set out on board the Nautilus, a submarine navigated by Captain Nemo. The player takes Anorax's role to find out more.

Most of the game is spent on the Nautilus, which consists of three rooms: the living room, the control room and the library. There the player can manipulate objects and talk to people to receive hints what to do next and the state of the Nautilus. With the map, he influences the route. Sometimes the player leaves the submarine to explore other locations, and respectively solves puzzles to receive more hints or to solve action sequences, e.g., fighting against a shark. 

The game is played in real-time, which means the key to success is being in the right location at the right time. This also results in various possibilities to render the game unwinnable, and causes waiting times. For the same reason, the player also needs to watch Nemo's mood. If he angers Nemo, e.g., by manipulating the ship instruments, he locks the player into his room and valuable time passes. The game is played completely in point &amp; click and has no function to save progress.</desc>

Seen from a first-person cockpit perspective and utilizing flat-shaded polygonal graphics, waves of aliens advance towards the player and must be destroyed with a laser cannon. Unlike in the originals, the aliens never shoot back: the only danger they pose is that of crashing into the player. If any aliens from a wave survive an attack run by not being destroyed before they pass the player, they will try again and again, until either the entire wave or the player is destroyed. The alien formations change every four waves, but not before a bonus stage involving navigating an asteroid field is passed.</desc>

		<name>3D Pool</name>
		<desc>3D Pool is one of the earliest 3D cue-sports games, featuring a fully-rotating table and variable viewpoint allowing for much more realistic shot-playing than the traditional top-down game style (although the game can be played this way instead). The pace, spin and angle of each shot can be set up precisely before playing it. Both 8-ball (pot your seven colors plus the black to win) and 9-ball (pot the 9-ball with a shot that also hits the lowest remaining ball, whatever that may be) are included.

There are seven skill levels to work through. A trick-shot mode is also included, with 20 pre-set shots. Prior to each match it is possible to bet on the outcome.</desc>

		<desc>As well as recreating off road racing, this game has considerable capability to upgrade your vehicle. There are four choices of vehicle on offer, each of which has its own weight/top-speed/build strength and so on, and thus is suited to different circuits. You can also buy upgrades and repairs, including carrying some spares.



There are four completely different types of course, each taking place on a different surface - Mud, Ice, Desert and Mountains. Each of these is littered with hazards, which can either be painstakingly avoided, or driven through (with the resultant risk of damage).</desc>

		<desc>Dirk the Daring was a heroic, if clumsy knight. When Princess Daphne was kidnapped by the dragon, Singe, and taken to his castle, Dirk set out to rescue her. Due to limitations of the computers at the time, this conversion of the coin-op arcade game, Dragon's Lair only features the first half of the game, which consists of entering Singe's Castle and encountering the dragon. The adventures are continued in a second part which completes the conversion of the arcade game.

Dirk the Daring is controlled by the player, who views Dirk's actions on the screen from third-person. The game is reactive and players must press the right controller direction or action button at the right time to have Dirk avoid traps, defeat monsters and otherwise stay alive.</desc>

		<desc>The land of Trazere was once ruled by the powerful and benevolent organization of mages known as Bloodwych. Governed by the Grand Dragon, the Bloodwych supervised over the balance in the land, protecting it from evil and driving it to prosperity. However, the second-in-command of Bloodwych, named Zendick, turned against his group, banished his opponents to the astral plane, and began working on a mad plan - summon the ultimate evil, the Lord of Entropy. The player controls the champion of Trazere, whose ultimate goal is to stop Zendick and restore peace in the country.

Bloodwych is an RPG in the style of Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder, being a 3D first-person maze-like game. This game's distinguishing feature is the two-player split screen support, allowing simultaneous playing on one computer.

Each player controls a party of four characters. The four basic classes are warrior, mage, adventurer, and thief; however, each class also has sub-classes, which are represented by four different colors. These colors come into play also when the characters learn and combine spells.</desc>

		<desc>For those of you who have not had the pleasure of Asteroids here is a description: The game is displayed in high contrast black and white, that's just black and white, there are no shades of grey in this game. Your ship is a small white triangle, in the centre of a black screen. When the game starts, asteroids, large irregular rock shapes, drift gently into view from the outer edges of the screen. Your ship can rotate in either direction, and fire, so this is what you must do, in
order to prevent your ship from being destroyed. As your shots hit the asteroids they break into smaller and smaller fragments, and the directions and speeds imparted to them seem to be highly convincing.

Cabaret Asteroids is a near perfect conversion of Asteroids for the Amiga. Its not in technicolor, there is no music, and the sounds are simple but effective. The playability of the original has not been surpassed though. I really can't fault the Cabaret Asteroids conversion, you can play by keyboard or joystick and it feels just like 1980, but without Sting and the guys in the background.</desc>

These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must utilise secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets</desc>

		<desc>Guide a team of up to four soldiers through 72 levels of combat in this innovative top-down action/strategy hybrid, best thought of as Lemmings crossed with Commando crossed with Dune 2. The characters are controlled indirectly using the mouse, as you activate each soldier or group of them by highlighting them, click the left button to move them to a particular spot, and the right button for them to fire guns at an enemy. You can also pick up grenades, which can be used to destroy groups of enemies or buildings (by pressing both buttons at once).

Each mission has a specific objective, and some feature vehicles such as tanks to make things easier. Your troops can cross water but can't shoot within it, so finding and controlling bridges is often crucial. You can use the arrangement of trees to find hiding places to shoot from, and should watch out for CPU soldiers also doing so.</desc>

		<name>Cedric And The Lost Sceptre [Fast]</name>
		<desc>Young Cedric is madly in love with the Princess, but he has to prove to the King that he's worthy of her hand, despite his lack of wealth. To do this he must retrieve the King's Sceptre.

Cedric takes the basic adventure game elements of object manipulation, puzzle solving, and conversations involving choosing from a range of pre-set sentences. However, it sets them in an arcade platform context. The options are hidden most of the time, and there&#x2019;s a fair supply of bad guys to be dispatched, either with a sword or by jumping on their heads. There are 11 levels of this to negotiate, with lots of jumps to navigate. Extra lives and improved weapons can be collected along the way.</desc>
