		<desc>CONTROL MAN AND BIRD IN A FIGHT FOR THE EIGHT JEWELS OF POWER!

After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again fluorished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.

These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction...And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!

The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.

Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return on the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the the eternal gratitude of all mankind!</desc>

Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies but they merely act as "lives" for the player as in more traditional fighting games, removing one of the main strategies of role-playing games from the game.</desc>

		<desc>Bored with board games? Tired of pursuing trivia? Had your fill of ethical questions? Then you're ready for ANTICIPATION. This zany, unpredictable, totally wacked-out video board game begins with a giant connect-the-dots puzzle. Suddenly, a video pencil starts connecting the dots and, before you know it, you're in a maddening race against the clock, trying to solve the puzzle. Is it an Igloo? A Penguin? Whatever it is, you - and all your friends - will have a great time trying to guess what the pencil is drawing. Guess right and you'll get a crack at the really tough puzzles - no dots or clues, just the pencil drawing a picture. Think you're up to it? Then challenge your friends. Or take on the computer. Either way, this off-the-floor board game will challenge you, excite you and generally drive you crazy for years to come.</desc>

		<desc>The full-court action between the Arch Rivals is really hot tonight. Here's Mohawk, taking it to the hoop... POW! He just got nailed in the alley with a right cross! FOUL! FOUL! FOUL!
What?! No Foul? That's right. No Fouls. This is basketball where breaking the rules is part of the rules! If you can't block a shot - knock your opponent's block off. If you can't steal the ball - steal his shorts! But don't think these tactics are enough to win. Arch Rivals still requires real B-ball skills like passing, shooting, ball handling, slam dunks, and 3 point shots.
Based on the arcade smash hit, Arch Rivals brings all of its hard-hitting "in your face" action into your home. Whether you're going for a fast break, dodging food on the court, or crashing the boards 'til they shatter, Arch Rivals isn't just basketball... it's a basketbrawl!</desc>

The controls are fairly simple: the A Button makes Astyanax jump, the B Button will attack with an axe called Bash, and a combination of up and attack will perform a special magic attack. The game also contains a few role-playing elements, such as weapons upgrades. It had a unique feature (for the time) of a bar that grows between attacks; the length of the bar determines how much damage Astyanax will do with his next attack. If one attacks rapidly, one's hits will do little damage, much unlike most games where a rapid succession of hits would all be equally damaging. A very similar system would be used in Secret of Mana some years later.</desc>

But after getting behind the wheel of a nuclear-powered sports car turned time machine, you find yourself in the year 1955 where you've accidentally tampered with history. Now it must be corrected. You must somehow make sure that teenagers Lorraine Baines and George McFly (the two kids that will eventually grow up to become your parents) fall in love before the photo of your family fades away and you're left with nothing to come home to. It won't be easy. You'll have to protect George from Biff and his gang of bullies while doing your best to keep them from beating you up instead. To complicate things, Lorraine has a crush on you, so you'll have to dodge her advances while trying to figure out a way to get George and her to kiss at the school dance. Time is wasting and even if you manage to put all of the pieces in place, there is still no guarantee that you'll get back. It will all come down to one brief moment in time when the past, present and future all meet.</desc>

The intro says: "Rampant ninja related crimes these days... Whitehouse is not the exception...". As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent (who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger as he appears in The Terminator) asks two street-smart brawlers, named Blade and Striker: "President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?", which this quote became an infamous meme and is often lampooned on the Internet. In the Japanese version, however, the words are completely different. After they heard that, the Bad Dudes confirmed it by pursuing the DragonNinja through the city streets, highway, sewers, transport train, forest, cave and into the secret ninja base, in order to save President Ronnie.</desc>

Once you tee off you'll have all kinds of decisions to make. Check your score card to see how you're doing. The card tells you the distance in yards and par for each hole. The computer gives you a bird's-eye view and cross-sectional view of each hole, as well as close-ups of the green. You select the right club for each shot. Control your shot to get the power, distance, and hook or slice you want on the ball. After you've made your shot the computer tells you what kind of lie you have as well as the remaining distance to the hole.</desc>

It became a major hit in many countries worldwide, particularly in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. Baseball Stars was a critical success, often referred to as the best baseball game on the NES platform (and possibly of all-time); as such it became a franchise series for SNK, spawning five sequels, and its "create player" and "create team" functions have become standard features in sports games.</desc>

		<name>Bases Loaded</name>
		<desc>The game allows the player to control one of 12 teams in either a single game or a full season. For single games, there is also a two-player option.
Bases Loaded featured a unique television-style depiction of the pitcher-batter matchup, as well as strong play control and a relatively high degree of realism, which made it one of the most popular baseball games of the early NES.
One unique feature of the game is that the pitcher can provoke a batter to charge the mound. Each team has only one batter (usually the team's best hitter) who can be provoked in this manner, however; it is up to the player to discover who it is.
At the time Bases Loaded was released, few video games were licensed by major league sports. Therefore, the league depicted in Bases Loaded is a fictitious league of twelve teams</desc>

This game stars Big Bird and co-stars Little Bird, and features Bert, Ernie, The Count, Grover, and Elmo. This game was developed by RSP Inc. and published by Hi Tech Expressions. All 4 sides of the D-pad move little bird to the next window clockwise; A and B Buttons both choose a window. The center buttons (Start and Select) exit to the game select screen. The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.</desc>

This game is also very difficult because you cannot restart from where you left off once all your lives are gone. It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club. There are also many pitfalls, traps and deadly lava/water since Big Nose can't swim.
It was followed by a sequel in 1992.</desc>

		<name>Bigfoot</name>
		<desc>Bigfoot was a racing game released in July 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It was developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim.  The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a "cross country" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.</desc>

The game's plot is not an adaptation of the movie, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film's events.  The story begins when Rufus summons Bill S. Preston Esq. and "Ted" Theodore Logan for a mission.  Both boys arrive at different times; first Ted then Bill.  They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.  Ted will also do the same for Bill's search after he has found a historical figure.</desc>

		<desc>Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge is a simulation of the NASCAR Winston Cup circuit, and thus operates like a racing game.  The gameplay action was always through an in-car perspective.  Players could chose to run single races at each track or run for the season championship.  The race distance was chosen by the player, which ranged from 10 miles to the realistic distance of 500 miles for the superspeedway races.  In the MS-DOS version, the championship consisted of a visit to each of the eight tracks.  In the NES and Game Boy versions, the season championship consisted of each of the four tracks run twice, for a total of eight races.  Championship points were awarded consistent to the real-life Winston Cup of the time.  Both the MS-DOS and Nintendo versions allowed the player to setup the car, with effects to be seen.  Both of those versions also allowed the player to choose whether they would race with the effect of damage on their car or not.  However, a large enough collision with another racecar on the track always would result in the player going out of the race in an out-of-control crash.</desc>

		<path>./Bo Jackson Baseball (U) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Bo Jackson Baseball</name>
		<desc>It is based on Bo Jackson's baseball career.  An option allows the player to play anywhere from five to nine innings.  Nintendo Power gave this game a 2.8 out of 5 in their September 1991 review while Electronic Gaming Monthly issued a 4.25 out of 10 review in their October 1991 issue of their magazine.  Players can either play in exhibition mode or playoff mode. Either one or two players can participate.  In addition to those options, a CPU vs CPU mode and a CPU vs CPU quick mode are available in order to quicken up a tournament; the purpose is to see the stats of that particular match and quickly end tournaments.  The game uses city names but not the team names because of not having any proper licensing with Major League Baseball.  However, the players are purely fictional and they cannot be edited.  Some of the player names are parodies of real life baseball players (such as Baltimore's "Kenrip" being a not-so-subtle parody of Cal Ripken).  There is even a cheat code that allows players to play as an all-Bo Jackson baseball team.</desc>

		<path>./Bonk's Adventure (U) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Bonk's Adventure</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies.  Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).  In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.  Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead.  Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage and three extra lives.  Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.  Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger.  There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable.  Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat.  The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time.  A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk.  Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power.  And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.  Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart which restores all of Bonk's missing health.  There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.  Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air.  Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up.  Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage.  The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.</desc>

So don't even mess with us toads, you wart for brains hare-ball. 'Cause it you do, I'll have to blast ya Toad Battle Cruisers and Double Bubble High Speed Toad Armada Tanks. That ain't the worst of it, pal! Once I've got your pointy ears in my sights, I'll drop the big bomb with Crater Centipedes, Robosnakes and triple threat Triborgs that your laser-guided Wart Remover doesn't have a shot against.

		<name>Cabal</name>
		<desc>The player assumes the role of an unnamed commando trying to destroy several enemy military bases. The player's character is seen from behind and initially starts behind a protective wall (the wall can get damaged and shattered by enemy fire). The player must use a limitless ammunition gun and a limited number of grenades to fend off enemy troops and damage the base. An enemy gauge at the bottom of the screen depletes as foes are destroyed and certain structures (usually the ones that collapse when destroyed, rather than simply shattering) are brought down. At the successful completion of a level by fully depleting the enemy gauge, all the remaining buildings onscreen collapse and the player progresses to the next stage. Boss fights, however, start from the beginning if a player dies. (A feature criticised by many players. It can be circumvented, however, if two players play simultaneously and at least one stays alive at a given moment.)
Power-ups appear from time to time, being released from objects destroyed onscreen. Some power-ups give special weapons: One of them is an extremely fast machinegun and other one is an automatic shotgun with a slightly lower firing rate, but has a larger crosshair, allowing it to strike a wider area with each shot. Others grant extra grenades or additional points.
Two players could play this game, cooperatively, simultaneously.
The arcade cabinet is a standard upright. Each player uses a trackball to move the player from side to side, and move the crosshairs about the screen. On later board revisions, a joystick was installed instead with an optional sub-pcb for use with a trackball. With a trackball, rolling (an invincible movement during which the player could not attack) is done by pushing the trackball to maximum speed.</desc>

		<name>Castelian</name>
		<desc>Castelian is a platform game with some distinctive unique features.  The player character, a small green creature called Pogo, is on a mission to destroy eight towers that have been built onto the sea by planting bombs at the towers' peaks.  Pogo's progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower.  The actual game play happens at each tower in turn.  Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top.  The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators.  Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no "left" or "right" edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.</desc>

		<name>Castle of Deceit</name>
		<desc>Castle of Deceit is a sidescrolling game for the NES where the player takes control of a wizard trapped in the titular castle with only one spell to defend himself.  The game was often considered frustrating for its length and lack of a save or password system.  Phfax, a mystic being and wielder of the Emerald Magic, consented to offer his life to protect the stones of Rune.  For centuries he dwelled within the plasma of energies of the stones where the Runes were hidden.  Until at last it drove him insane.  Such was the power of the stone that even the bitter hallucinations of his madness were given life.  Six deadly beings appeared stealing the Rune Stones.  You, Cebo, the most promising of the young Magicians of Dace, must enter the castle, exploring the realities. But do not trust your senses - what you see, what you hear may all be a lie!</desc>

Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!</desc>

Many of the levels can be avoided altogether by just walking backwards and back through the curtain from where the player begins. This will take him right to that level's boss battle.
Bonus levels include such fun things as guiding a bear to jump over flames, avoiding boulders in a car, using Rodan as target practice and meeting Godzilla at the circus grounds.</desc>

		<name>City Connection</name>
		<desc>The main character in the game is a female driver, Clarice, of a Honda City (the North American version features a male driver) on a tour of all the sights and roads across the world. To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car "explodes" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to "explode") with playing of a comical music, "Der Flohwalzer", known as "Neko Funjatta" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car "explode" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the "catchy" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city. Although it uses "ethnic" variations according to the destination, it's an adaptation of a famous classic piece, "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso", from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.</desc>

The tiles have words denoting game prizes ("Mexico", "Camera", "Telescope", for example) and your object is to find the two matching worded tiles. Exposing two at a time, your memory is taxed as more prize tiles are revealed and then covered over again. As more tiles are matched, the hidden puzzle is revealed.

		<name>Cobra Triangle</name>
		<desc>There are 25 stages in the game, including bonus stages. Each series of five generally contains one of each type of mission. The fifth are generally the boss stages. The bosses are a sea serpent (as seen on the cover), a giant crab, a giant squid, a red and black version of the sea serpent and a giant shark. The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are "Turbo" (increase the speed of the boat), "Fire" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), "Speed" (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), "Missile" (improves missiles) and "Force" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or enemy fire.</desc>

		<desc>Theodore "Todd" Thornley IV has had enough. After being humiliated once again by his rival, Jeff "Crash" Cooney and his blue-collar buddies from Southside High School at the All-City Track Meet, he has decided to issue a challenge to Crash. Inviting two of the other elite high schools to participate in the challenge, plus an additional team sponsored by his wealthy father, Todd has seemingly stacked the deck against Crash and his boys. The game has four different teams to choose from, as well as a fifth computer-controlled team. Each team have five members each with their own strengths and weaknesses, making some better suited to certain events than others. Before each event, players have the opportunity to go shopping in the mall to buy power-ups for their characters. These items are paid for through the various medals that each team achieve as they progress through the challenge, but since the winner of the challenge is the team that collects the most medals overall, players must be fairly judicious in how much they spend. There are two types of events in the game: individual events (Hammer Throw and Roof Top Jumping) and head-to-head events (400 Meter Hurdles, Swimming and Fighting). In individual events, each team takes turn individually and ranking is determined by who gets the most points. The head-to-head events take place under a single elimination tournament format, in which one player against another in a series of heats. The player who successfully defeats both of his opponents will get to compete against a member of Team Thornley for first place. The game can be played by up to four players. Since there's never more than two teams competing at the same time, the third and fourth player can play simply by alternating between the two controllers. Thus, a four player adapter is not required, unlike other Kunio-kun games.</desc>

		<path>./Cyberball (U) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Cyberball</name>
		<desc>Cyberball is an Atari Games arcade game of 7-man American football, using robotic avatars of different speeds, sizes, and skill sets. The game replaced the standard downs system with an explosive ball that progresses from "cool" to "warm", "hot", and "critical" status as it is used. Players can only defuse the ball, resetting it from its current state back to "cool" by crossing the 50 yard line or by change of possession, whether through touchdown, interception or fumble. A robot holding a critical ball while being tackled is destroyed along with the ball. The robots also possess finite durability. As offensive units are tackled, they wear down, finally issuing smoke and then flames after a number of hits. A flaming robot will explode when hit, thereby fumbling the ball. Players can upgrade robots with faster and more durable units using money bonuses they earn during play. Players select from run, pass or option plays on offense, after which the computer presents four individual plays from which to choose. On defense, a player can select short, medium or long defenses, and then select a specific defensive scheme.
The standard Cyberball cabinet consists of two monitors, each with two sets of controls for a maximum of four players, but Atari Games released single player and two player versions as well.
The standard configuration allows single player, two player cooperative, two player head-to-head or four player head-to-head play. Playing with two teams of two persons opened up a new dimension of gameplay. Computer controlled avatars ran offensive patterns in very specific ways before reaching their assigned passing spots. Human players, however, could exploit the fact that a number of offensive plays started with identical formations. By choosing one play, but moving their avatars in imitation of a similar but different play, the offensive team could disguise their intentions before suddenly breaking for their assigned pass locations. This offensive flexibility forced defending players to quickly recognize plays and move to break them up by rushing to what they guessed was the intended passing spot. Most often, the timely use of the defender's turbo, a short-term speed boost usable once per play, would determine whether the play resulted in a missed pass, an interception, a long gain, or a score. This ability to improvise in four player mode built the popularity of Cyberball, leading to many tournaments across the United States for a period of time.
Cyberball was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992 by Jaleco. Tengen intended to release it unlicensed, but Jaleco purchased rights to publish it first. It has also been ported to numerous other platforms, including the Commodore Amiga, Atari Lynx and Sega Genesis.</desc>

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with their feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.</desc>

Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a  overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.</desc>

The object of the game is to run down innocent pedestrians in your souped-up automotive grim reaper. Progress through the race courses in 8 U.S. cities, moving from west to east starting with San Diego and Phoenix. Each race consists of capturing a flag and finding the exit door, all while squishing or gunning down as many people on foot as possible while avoiding helicopters and heat seeking missiles that are actively trying to discourage this unique hobby. If the time runs out, a barrage of missiles descends on the player's car to indicate that the race is over.

The player has a certain amount of money to begin with and earns more money for completing the races alive. This money can be used to upgrade the engine, steering, tires, chassis, or weapon systems on the car.</desc>

		<name>Desert Commander</name>
		<desc>The player's force consists of nine different types of units and one headquarters unit (which is a unit by itself and also can be used to attack). Each scenario gives a different set number of units to use, which the player can mix and match between the different typese without going over that limit. When in a one-player game, the second controller can be used to modify the CPU forces. When playing against the CPU, the computer will be given a different ratio of units to command than the player. On the easiest scenario both the player and the CPU have the same amount of units, on all others the CPU will have more than the player. There is no variance in artificial intelligence, so the only thing that makes the later maps harder is the larger number of units the CPU has. The game is turn-based with no time limit. The object of the game is to destroy the enemy's headquarters unit. The player that does so first wins. Units have different mobility range, which varies according to the unit type and (except for aircraft) the terrain. They also have different shooting range, though this is fixed and not depends of the terrain. All unit types have limited ammunition and fuel. In order to replenish them the player must land them at the appropiate buildings; for example, all aircraft must stop at an airport in order to recharge their fuel and ammo supply. A certain unit is particularly strong or weak against a particular opponent, performing average against every other unit types.</desc>

		<desc>The view of the game is from the cockpit of a spacecraft. The goal of the game is to explore a grid which is displayed on screen in search of opponents to destroy and to land on planets some of which refuel the energy and refill ammo to the player's arsenal of weapons which consist of his photon laser. This is his primary weapon while the torpedoes become his second weapon. After the player has destroyed every enemy that is on the grid, a number will be indicated. This number represents how many enemies are in that quadrant of the grid. After blasting numerous enemies, the player will finally be able to go to the planet labeled "B" on the grid. These planets are unlike the other planets as they do not refill the player's vehicles energy or ammo. Rather, they are an enemy base that proceeds with the player entering a 8-bit cutscene of his space craft entering the base's gravitational orbit with the game play changing from a first person cockpit you had on the grid stage to a horizntal 2D shmup stage similar to Konami's Gradius or R-Type. Using this perspective, the player can fire projectiles from the front or back of his ship.</desc>

		<desc>Bandai released their version of Dick Tracy in August 1990. The objective is to solve several mysteries without accusing the wrong person or shooting too many unarmed villains.
Each level starts out with a case to solve, and some possible clues. The player drives Tracy's vehicle through the city, avoiding snipers and other cars, to various locations mentioned in the clues, where the action shifts to a side-scrolling adventure game. If the player goes to the right location, he will find, during the course of his side-scrolling fighting, a clue icon that provides additional clues for the case, or the player will be able to speak with a character from the comics who give clues. There is one car chase in each level. Once the player has collected enough clues, he can drive to the location where the perpetrator is and arrest him.</desc>

		<name>Die Hard</name>
		<desc>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building and John McClane's task is to clear each floor of terrorists and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.</desc>

A timer in the game represents the time remaining until the door to the next level closes, but the timer can be reset by standing on a special pillar. Monsters such as moles and mosquitoes seek to kill the protagonist.

In fact, the game begins with a digitized sample of that quote. The game play consists primarily of side-scrolling action. Dirty Harry can punch and kick the copious thugs that assault him using their own fists, guns, baseball bats, nets, and dynamite. The hero can also pull is .44 and aim it in 5 directions in order to pick off enemies, but the ammo is limited. Further, Dirty Harry has a number of other tools at his disposal, provided he collects them.</desc>

Come here you!" and Pogie promptly darted off into the enchanted forest to escape Daisy's rage. Dizzy and Daisy decided to go into the forest to catch Pogie and gather some more cherries at the same time. Whilst searching for Pogie they got lost and found a castle, where they thought they would find help, but it seemed deserted. They looked in the castle for Pogie, but Daisy caught herself on a mystic spinning wheel. She started feeling really sleepy, so she found a bed and went to sleep. "Wake up Daisy, wake up!" shouted Dizzy. But before he could wake her up, Rockwart the troll caught him and locked him up in an underground prison! Now Dizzy must escape, wake up Daisy from her enchanted sleep, defeat Rockwart, and find the cherries along the way.</desc>

		<desc>Doki! Doki! Yūenchi: Crazy Land Daisakusen is a Nintendo Family Computer video game developed by KID and released in 1991 by VAP. Players control a boy with a helmet who kicks balls at enemies in an attempt to save his girlfriend from an unknown force inside an amusement park. The more damage he takes the more damage he does to enemies.

The game was originally called Doki! Doki! Yūenchi (ドキ!ドキ!遊園地?) in Japanese, meaning "Thump! Thump! Amusement Park". Doki (ドキ?) is a Japanese onomatopoeia.

The game was renamed The Trolls in Crazyland for release on the NES by American Softworks. It was previously scheuled to be released as Crazyland, but was then changed to feature the popular Troll dolls. That version was only released in Italy(PAL-A), and Eastern Europe(PAL-B).</desc>

In the two player mode, two players control two characters as they race to create a math formula to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, incorporating platform gameplay. The mechanics are similar to Donkey Kong Junior; players climb vines to reach higher areas in order to collect numbers scattered around the area. In order to complete mathematics problems, players must collect at least three things: the first number, the symbol necessary to reach the number shown by Donkey Kong, and the second number. When the game features a high number, such as 66, players must collect multiple numbers and mathematics symbols in order to reach this. For example, players could choose a nine, a multiplication symbol, and a seven, followed by an addition symbol and a three to reach the number 66. The two player game have two different levels, Calculate A and Calculate B. Calculate B is more challanging, not only the goal is a negative number, but giving players the set number.</desc>

		<name>Double Dare</name>
		<desc>The video game version of Double Dare played exactly like its television counterpart. Rounds one and two were 10-question trivia rounds, each of which started with a toss-up challenge. Round three – the obstacle course – featured eight stages to be completed within 60 seconds. Toss-up challenges determined which team got initial control of the trivia round. To complete a toss-up, each player had to determine the precise speed and angle of whatever object they were throwing to hit a target.  Physical challenges were played the same way. All questions were multiple choice, and each player could use the up or down arrows on the controller to make his selection. Three possible answers and either a dare, double dare, or physical challenge option were offered. The player confirmed his selection by pressing the A button. Confirming a dare doubled the base dollar value of the question; a double dare quadrupled the base dollar value. The player with the most money at the end of round two went on to the obstacle course. In order to move through an obstacle, the player had to repeatedly alternate between pressing either the left and right or up and down arrows on the controller's D-pad. In order to grab the flag, the player had to position the on-screen contestant in just the right spot and then press the A button to jump and retrieve it. Some found it easier to get through the course by using the NES Advantage, a joystick controller, rather than the NES' standard controller. The obstacles are all based on real obstacles from the show (with one exception) and are randomized before a game. They include The Tank, The 1-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, The Fireman's Flagpole, The Monkey Bars, "Dallas", Mount St. Double Dare, Moonwalk, and an original obstacle designed like a triangular jungle gym. "Prizes" for beating the obstacle course included a BMX bicycle, television set, an NES console, and several other gifts, ending with a exotic vacation -- though it can prove very difficult to get the best "ending" by completing the last obstacle. The obstacle course's flag colour depended on which team was playing, if blue, the flags were blue, and if red, the flags were red.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Fighter</name>
		<desc>The player takes control of a magical human fighter who has the ability to transform himself into a flying dragon. As the fighter, the player can run, crouch, jump, and attack with his sword as he would in most side-scrolling action games. Underneath his life gauge is a "metamorphosis gauge" that will gradually be filled as the player destroys his enemies. When the metamorphosis gauge begins to flash, the player can transform into the dragon by pressing up and A button after jumping. As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game. The dragon's main attack is his fire breath. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. While in dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again.
As the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player's outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon's fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health.
There are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Power</name>
		<desc>Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).</desc>

		<desc>Dragon Warrior uses console role-playing game mechanics which were described by Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra as archaic in 2008. The player takes the role of a namable Hero. The Hero's name has an effect on his statistical growth over the course of the game. Battles are fought in a turn-based format and experience points and gold are awarded after every battle, allowing the Hero to level-up in ability and allows them to buy better weapons, armor, and items. Progression consists of traveling over an overworld map and through dungeons, fighting monsters encountered via random battles along the journey.

" As a whole, Dragon Warrior has been credited with establishing the basic template for the Japanese console RPGs that followed. " -Wikipedia</desc>

		<desc>500 years ago, the Kingdom of Granville fought a terrible war with Darces the Dark Overlord. A great hero, the warrior "Magi", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, "Tores", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, "When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five."</desc>

		<desc>Drivers earn thousands of dollars by competing in hydroplane races, setting track records, rescuing stranded people, and collecting cash bonuses. With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.</desc>

		<desc>Bored with board games? Tired of pursuing trivia? Had your fill of ethical questions? Then you're ready for ANTICIPATION. This zany, unpredictable, totally wacked-out video board game begins with a giant connect-the-dots puzzle. Suddenly, a video pencil starts connecting the dots and, before you know it, you're in a maddening race against the clock, trying to solve the puzzle. Is it an Igloo? A Penguin? Whatever it is, you - and all your friends - will have a great time trying to guess what the pencil is drawing. Guess right and you'll get a crack at the really tough puzzles - no dots or clues, just the pencil drawing a picture. Think you're up to it? Then challenge your friends. Or take on the computer. Either way, this off-the-floor board game will challenge you, excite you and generally drive you crazy for years to come.</desc>

What?! No Foul? That's right. No Fouls. This is basketball where breaking the rules is part of the rules! If you can't block a shot - knock your opponent's block off. If you can't steal the ball - steal his shorts! But don't think these tactics are enough to win. Arch Rivals still requires real B-ball skills like passing, shooting, ball handling, slam dunks, and 3 point shots.
Based on the arcade smash hit, Arch Rivals brings all of its hard-hitting "in your face" action into your home. Whether you're going for a fast break, dodging food on the court, or crashing the boards 'til they shatter, Arch Rivals isn't just basketball... it's a basketbrawl!</desc>

The peace and quiet of the small village of indomitable Gauls is broken by a disturbing piece of news: Obelix has failed to return from his wild boar hunt. The village council convenes and Asterix decides to set off to find his friend.

Leave with him and travel throughout Gaul, across the Roman Empire, taking your search as far afield as the Egyptian Pyramids...

And as you battle with the Roman armies and avoid the traps set by Caesar's spies, perhaps you will find Obelix.

Magic potion, Romans, fights, punches, catapults, wild boar, not forgetting that fish that's not quite "fresh"...

		<desc>Astyanax is a side-scrolling platform game. The controls are fairly simple: the A Button makes Astyanax jump, the B Button will attack with an axe called Bash, and a combination of up and attack will perform a special magic attack. The game also contains a few role-playing elements, such as weapons upgrades. It had a unique feature (for the time) of a bar that grows between attacks; the length of the bar determines how much damage Astyanax will do with his next attack. If one attacks rapidly, one's hits will do little damage, much unlike most games where a rapid succession of hits would all be equally damaging. A very similar system would be used in Secret of Mana some years later.</desc>

		<desc>The game starts in New York City, where President Ronnie (based on former U.S. President Ronald Reagan) has been kidnapped by the nefarious DragonNinja. The intro says: "Rampant ninja related crimes these days... Whitehouse is not the exception...". As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent (who resembles Arnold Schwarzenegger as he appears in The Terminator) asks two street-smart brawlers, named Blade and Striker: "President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?", which this quote became an infamous meme and is often lampooned on the Internet. In the Japanese version, however, the words are completely different. After they heard that, the Bad Dudes confirmed it by pursuing the DragonNinja through the city streets, highway, sewers, transport train, forest, cave and into the secret ninja base, in order to save President Ronnie.</desc>

		<desc>Bigfoot was a racing game released in July 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It was developed by Beam Software and published by Acclaim.  The game was advertised by the legendary monster truck of the same name in the cartoon segment of the 1990 television show Video Power, titled The Power Team.  The show also often used sound effects for the actions of not only Bigfoot, but others as well.  The gameplay involves racing monster trucks including the title truck, Bigfoot (blue). The computer controlled trucks are green (The Growler) and yellow (The Charger) if the computer's truck runs out of money and cannot repair their rig.  It was not uncommon for a skilled player to be challenged by three to four different monster trucks during the game.  In two player mode the 2nd player's truck is red.  The object of the game is to advance to the next level (race) with incurring the least amount of damage as possible.  The levels consist of car crushing, mud bog, tractor pull, hill climb and the later levels are a combination of everything except the sled pull, simply called a drag race.  To advance to the next event the player must complete a "cross country" race collecting money, points, etc. without damaging the truck.</desc>

His crew, Dead Eye Duck, Blinky, Jenny the Aldeberan Cat and the genius earth boy Willy DuWitt, have been captured by the Toad Empire. Now you must play the role of Bucky, blasting past the fiercest toads in the Aniverse. It's an intense arcade action battle with eight hare-raising levels.

WE INTERUPT THIS PACKAGE FOR A SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM TOAD HEADQUARTERS!

Greetings, warthead. This is the Toad Air Marshall, coming to you live from the Toad Magma Tanker. I'm here to smash an ugly rumor goin' around that says you're thinking about becoming Bucky O'Hare in a futile attempt to rescue the captured crew of the Righteous Ingignation.

Fool! Those lunkhead traitors are guided by the elite Storm Toad Troopers in four toad prisons hidden throughout the planetoid belt, from the Way-Cool Ice Planet to the Burnin' Hunk of Lava Star. So don't even mess with us toads, you wart for brains hare-ball. 'Cause it you do, I'll have to blast ya Toad Battle Cruisers and Double Bubble High Speed Toad Armada Tanks. That ain't the worst of it, pal! Once I've got your pointy ears in my sights, I'll drop the big bomb with Crater Centipedes, Robosnakes and triple threat Triborgs that your laser-guided Wart Remover doesn't have a shot against.

Face it rabbit. Try to croak us toads, and you'll be one unlucky Bucky!</desc>

Pogo's progress is hindered by enemies and obstacles which he has to avoid in order to reach the top of the tower.  The actual game play happens at each tower in turn.  Pogo starts from the bottom and has to find his way up to the top.  The towers are cylinder-shaped and have ledges on their outside, either horizontal, forming stairs or connected by elevators.  Because of the cylindrical shape, the towers have no "left" or "right" edges, instead allowing Pogo to walk all around the tower.</desc>

Well think again, 'cause according to a damsel in distress, evil Count Dracula has left a horrifying curse in his wake. And the only hope you have of ending the terror is to destroy his missing body parts! Talk about your frightening quest, searching a maze of mansions, graveyards and dark, eerie forests - each guarded by man-eating werewolves, fire-throwing zombies and other devilish demons. Your grim chances are kept alive in Transylvania, where cowardly villagers offer clues to the whereabouts of Dracula's remains.

Destroying this legion of Swamp Dragons, Slasher Skeletons and Forces of the Undead will be the supreme challenge for the mightiest of warriors. Your place in history is 100 years before Simon Belmont's birth. Dracula is young at heart, and it will take more than a stake to penetrate his evil. Luckily, you command the role of Trevor - Simon's forefather and the origin of the Belmont Warlord Chromosomes. Trevor has a power never before seen by human eyes - the power to transform into three different spirits: Grant DaNasty, the ferocious Ghost Pirate. Sypha, the Mystic Warlord. And Alucard, Dracula's forgotten son. You must perfectly time Trevor's body transformations to match up his different fighting spirits against Ultimate Evils. Trevor also has the strength and wisdom to command the Battle Axe, Invisibility Potion and Mystic Whip. But the most important weapon Trevor has is your cunning to choose the correct Paths of Fate and your bravery to lead him past 17 possible levels of never-ending doom, including the Haunted Ship of Fools, the Sunken City of Poltergeists, the Clock Tower of Untimely Death and Curse Castle. Never before have so many dangers confronted you at one time. And if by some miracle you triumph, you'll no longer be a mere mortal. You'll be a legend who'll live forever!</desc>

		<name>City Connection</name>
		<desc>The main character in the game is a female driver, Clarice, of a Honda City (the North American version features a male driver) on a tour of all the sights and roads across the world. To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car "explodes" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to "explode") with playing of a comical music, "Der Flohwalzer", known as "Neko Funjatta" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car "explode" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the "catchy" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city. Although it uses "ethnic" variations according to the destination, it's an adaptation of a famous classic piece, "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso", from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.</desc>

The game uses a powerup bar similar to the Gradius series. Powerup pods are collected to move the selector to different powerup items. When the desired powerup is highlighted, the player can select it, after which the menu returns to an unhighlighted state. Menu options are "Turbo" (increase the speed of the boat), "Fire" (increase the number of bullets the primary gun fires), "Speed" (increase speed of shots and rate of fire), "Missile" (improves missiles) and "Force" (a force field around the boat plus replenished health). The speed boat used for game play starts with a single gun which can be upgraded to a quadruple spread shot. Missiles can also be added to the boat's arsenal and can be upgraded to heat-seekers. Between stages which are not connected by water, the Cobra Class has a helicopter style propeller that extends from the roof of the cabin. However, this flying state of the boat is never used in gameplay. The boat has a 12-point damage bar which can be reduced by contact with obstacles or enemy fire.</desc>

		<desc>The game involves at driving on America's roads at approximately 200 miles (320 km) per hour from Boston to Los Angeles - a whopping 2,990 miles (4,810 km) from start to finish. Each player must try to gain personal glory by competing against eight computer-controlled players who can race their way across the United States of America. However, the drivers have fictional names and are neither based on the Formula One or the NASCAR Winston Cup (now Sprint Cup Series) racers of that era. If the game was based on real world physics, it would take at least fourteen days to get from Boston to Los Angeles (providing that only fuel stops were made and no attempts were made to get some sleep).</desc>

		<name>Crackout</name>
		<desc>Crackout is based upon Atari's Breakout games of the 1970s. The object of the game is to clear levels by either destroying all bricks or defeating the enemies.

There are four zones of eleven levels each. The zones are Cubic Zone, Mirror Zone, Tube Zone and Final Zone. This game differs from the original Breakout as it contained enemies on screen that could be hit to gain power ups. Powerups included a parachute to slow the ball down, multiple balls, or projectiles. There were also level warps in the form of "Konami Man", who would fly from top to bottom of the play area. There were typically 1 - 3 enemies on screen at once, appearing out of a trapdoor in the top corners, or let in through the side walls. Every few levels there was also a boss, ranging from a small dragon to a centipede. The bosses changed colour from Green to Blue to Pink, each time increasing in speed. Each level also contained a hidden letter which made up a password presented at the end of the game (Zone 4 Level 11). If this was not input correctly, the player restarted the game from the beginning. If the player input the password correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from the game. The password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.</desc>

		<desc>In the PC version, gameplay consisted of setting up the car, qualifying, and then the actual race event. If the player finished in a high enough position they would progress to the next circuit. Damage was calculated not by realistic damage displayed on the car but a "cracked dashboard" bar indicator, with cracks appearing along the dashboard when the player hits something.
The in-game graphics in the PC version paled in comparison to the still-screen graphics it had. This was due to polygonal graphics being used as opposed to sprites, rendering the car, track, and trackside details in untextured 3D polygons.</desc>

He navigates through a series of mazes and touches Crosses to power up and summon the ability to breathe fire and eat the dots in the maze. Without a cross, he is completely helpless, and cannot complete the maze. The large winged demon simply called "the Devil" dances at the top of the screen, pointing the direction for his minions to move the maze. This can be dangerous, as Tamagon can be squished by getting caught between a maze wall and the moving outer boundary. After the first maze is cleared, the next objective is to get four Bibles, and put them into a seal. The Bibles give Tamagon the same powers as with the Crosses. After carrying them all into the seal, the Devil flies to the next maze. In between, a bonus maze shows up where Tamagon collects six Bonus Boxes under a time limit. The pattern then repeats.</desc>

		<desc>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building and John McClane's task is to clear each floor of terrorists and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.</desc>

Monsters such as moles and mosquitoes seek to kill the protagonist. The game is notable for the animation of the character's death, which shows a presumably time-lapse view of his body decaying with only his helmet remaining. It is noted among the most difficult games on the NES.</desc>

		<desc>Drivers earn thousands of dollars by competing in hydroplane races, setting track records, rescuing stranded people, and collecting cash bonuses. With these winnings they can repair or upgrade various components of the hydroplane to improve racing performance and remain competitive in the increasingly-difficult races. Eliminator Boat Duel offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Expert. Completing a race at a lower difficulty level advances the player to the next higher one. At each difficulty level, the player's hydroplane can be damaged from impact with animals, the opponent's hydroplane, and various stationary objects. A false start is penalized with a $2,000 fine. For most of a race, players control their hydroplanes from a bird's-eye view, and the screen scrolls in multiple directions; but in one segment of the race, the graphical perspective changes to a third-person tracking mode. In a single-player game, the player competes first with Seasick Sidney (in Easy mode), with Aquarius Rex (in Normal mode), or with Surfer Bob (in Expert mode). The player then competes against Vicious Vicky, Weird Willy, Mangler Mike, Veronica Alabaster, and Disaster Don (the reigning World Champion), respectively. To win, the player must defeat each opponent one-against-one on three unique race courses. Eliminator Boat Duel has 24 unique race courses.</desc>

		<desc>Unlock doors of legend on your journey through Faxanadu!

You are the elves’ last hope. Outside the town walls lurk monsters with the power to destroy anything in their path. Inside the walls, water and time are running out. Soon the ancient elf town of Eolis will vanish into eternity. Only you can save Eolis. No one else dares to venture beyond the walls, onto the World Tree, where towns and fortresses precariously await the whims of fate at the hands of the Evil.

You are searching for the water source and for an antidote to the poison that makes the water undrinkable. To find them you’ll need gold and food and magic, speed with a sword … and luck.

Every town holds a new mystery, every fortress a new danger. Merchants will sell you magic and valuable tools, but it’s up to you to figure out what you need. Long, secret mantras help you slip through the mists, but will you survive the next challenge?

This is Faxanadu, the legend, the adventure – the incredible journey on the World Tree.</desc>

		<name>Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge</name>
		<desc>The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is a simplified version that allows players to practice up to six laps or qualify for every Formula One race of the season using metric units (kilometres per hour instead of miles per hour). It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.
Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

		<name>Galaga</name>
		<desc>The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.
Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's "hit/miss ratio" at the end of the game, and a bonus "Challenging Stage" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.
Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a "boss Galaga" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.
Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous "Split-Screen bug" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game "rolls over" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.</desc>

However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. These items are found by shooting barrels and rifles, boots, and bullets can stock up to five.</desc>

Each of the four elemental realms consists of two stages. In the first stage, Kuros must find a golden artifact which belongs to the Animal King of the realm; once accomplished, the path to the second part of the realm will appear. In the second stage, the goal is to find the magic spell which can be used to fight the elemental boss. Without the spell, it is impossible to damage the boss. Once the elemental in each stage has been destroyed, Kuros obtains a piece of the legendary Iron Sword, which is needed for the final battle on Icefire Mountain.</desc>

Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play.</desc>

This game is also very difficult because you cannot restart from where you left off once all your lives are gone. It is also very long with four islands (Paradise Island, Monster Island, Terror Island, and Chaos Island) each containing several levels. Big Nose the Caveman dies in a single hit unless he has stones. The stones can shoot out of his club, killing enemies. As many as three stones can come out of the club. There are also many pitfalls, traps and deadly lava/water since Big Nose can't swim.
It was followed by a sequel in 1992.</desc>

		<name>The Jungle Book</name>
		<desc>A 2D platformer based on the 1967 animated Disney movie and released on multiple platforms. It was one of four Virgin Interactive platformers based on Disney movies, along with The Lion King, Aladdin and Pinocchio.

Walt Disney's The Jungle Book is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Disney film of the same name. As Mowgli, the player must make their way from Mowgli's home in the jungle to the human village. Along the way, he faces various dangers such as pitfalls, fruit-throwing monkeys, and spitting snakes. The ultimate objective is to defeat Shere Khan, a cunning tiger who hunts humans.

Virgin Interactive developed the game for multiple consoles, including the Game Boy, NES, SNES, Genesis, Sega Master System and Game Gear. It was part of a series of Disney licensed platformers they created in the mid-90s.</desc>

		<desc>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

		<desc>Lemmings was one of the most popular computer games of its time, and several gaming magazines gave it some of their highest review scores at the time.

The behavior of the creatures in Lemmings is based on the supposed behavior of real lemmings, who by urban legend are believed to go on migrations en masse that eventually lead to disaster. The basic objective of the game is to guide lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.</desc>

		<desc>It's you against the evil Mother Brain in the thrilling battle of Metroid!

You’re inside the fortress planet Zebes.  The planet of endless secret passageways where the Metroid are multiplying.  Left alone the Metroid are harmless.  But in the wrong hands they could destroy the galaxy.  It’s up to you to prevent the Mother Brain that controls Zebes from using the Metroid for evil purposes.  But that won’t be easy.  You’ll have to use your spacesuit to absorb valuable energy for your search to gain the use of power items like the Ice Beam, Wave Beam, High Jump Boots and Varia.  If you survive, it will be you and your acquired powers against the Mother Brain.

Worth Noting: 
Metroid introduced nonlinear, side-scroller, maze-like, gameplay, in a platform, shooter. Metroid required players to discover permanent power-ups to progress further along; while backtracking through previously visited areas. The style is affectionately known as Metroid-vania' (Castlevania: Symphony of the Night being the second half to the term, mirrored the concept).

Metroid also used a password system to resume progression of the game (Before the addition of battery backups and save files in console cartridges). Additionally the password system could be used for cheat codes: 'JUSTIN BAILEY ------ ------' (Just in Ballet) being famous, would remove Samus' power suit and start the player with many of the power-ups and fairly progressed through the game.

Completing the game in time and with enough power-ups revealed different endings. At the end Samus removes the helmet or power suit (depending) to a reveal a shocking suprise that endeared the character and broke new ground in gaming.</desc>

Ultra® Dares you to defy the impossible.  But if you accept, be forewarned.  You and your trio of Impossible Mission Force agents will infiltrate a six level maze of unthinkable danger.  A fortress of international evil designed to sap every ounce of your brains and brawn.  At each turn you must fend off snipers and fire bomb maniacs.  Elude spy cameras and robot sentries.  Escape from countless enemies in hot pursuit.  All in your desperate search for booby-trapped clues, secret ID cards and life-saving switches.
  Any why?  Because the worldwide terrors known as the Sinister Seven have kidnapped Dr. "O," his nuclear military defense system and IMF agent Shannon Reed, and now they threaten to wreak planetary chaos.
  Luckly, your agents are well schooled in the art of espionage and possess their own favored firepower, from rifles to remote control cluster bombs.  But that's no guarantee you'll make it past brutes like Slash Stiletto, Blitz Blizzardski and the Iron Claw.  If by chance you do, there's always the hyper speedboat chases through Venice, hand grenade ski runs down the Swiss Alps, and prison camps in the Pyrenees mountains.
  Remember, should you choose to accept this mission and fail, you, your Nintendo®, and the world will self-destruct in five seconds.</desc>

This was one of the first shooter games to feature a storyline, and it had some similarities to real special operations missions.</desc>

		<desc>Modern warfare is no match for the fierce realism of six historically accurate severteenth century pirate raids along the Spanish Main. Aye, matey! That's why plundering and pillaging are back in style, as you command the role of a high seas high-jacker. Either an English Buccaneer, Dutch Adventurer, Spanish Renegade or French Explorer, each with a different skill level and strategic impact.
As a swashbuckling scoundrel, you'll barter with enemy merchants, trade for hidden treasure maps, negotiate with unscrupulous governors and forge alliances with monarchs who'd just as soon stab you in the back than float you a loan for new ships. Buth that's only half the battle! You'll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantment and English Sloops.
Arrrrg, me swabby! Don't think it's all fun and destruction. Because if your bloodthirsty crew isn't hept happy boarding and burning enemy vessels, or if your navigation skills leave them shipwreched on a jagged Caribbean reef, they won't think twice about using you for shark bait. Fortunately, if events do take a nasty turn, you can save the statistical foot you've captured and return with a vangeance on another day.</desc>

The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</desc>

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.</desc>

In the year 2634, the Earth has finally escaped from the hand of black magic, one year after the end of the war with a mysterious alien army, or has it?  One day, a strange radio message comes in from General Hal of the federation troops as he is heading for the base ruins in South America in preparation for the seventh GX army maneuvers.  “Friendly GX troops have suddenly turned their attack on us.  No, it can’t be!! They’re not human! They must be…”  The message cut off there. The commanding officers of the federation troops feel very strange about this message from the general and so dispatch Probotector RD008 and RC011, the strongest fighting robots in history, to find him. A helicopter carrying the two units is sent out on a top secret mission. When it gets close to the site of maneuvers, it lands, drops off the two units, and takes off again immediately. Just then, from out of the shadows come soldiers on the attack. But they are not soldiers! They are robots! The nightmare of one year ago has returned. The mutant alien life forms that were believed destroyed are alive again.  Now they control the GX army, have built fighting robots and are planning to take over the world!  Once again the fight to the death between the Probotector and the aliens has begun.</desc>

With their greedy eyes on RollerGames' mega prize money, they've corrupted three teams and kidnapped Emerson "Skeeter" Bankhead, the games' beloved commissioner. You and your own three teams of righteous skate kings must stop V.I.P.E.R.'s criminal venom from infecting the entire city. So you've got to take the fight to the streets. And the sewers, and the junkyards, and the highways and the jungles... through 6 stages of dastardly traps of doom as you leap over open manholes, careening oil drums and treacherous landslides. Race around oil slicks and man-eating canines. And avoid ambush by combat copters, bomb-wielding goons and creeps like Captain Meat Hook and the Fish Face. But time is against you. And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!</desc>

Armed "satellite robots" assist you in battle. No arms on Earth can withstand the power in your hands!</desc>

		<desc>The main objective is to cross different USA cities and reach the predetermined scores to go ahead. But remember: you'll have only 16 balls and every error can be lethal!

The game also comes with modes for 2 players with two variants: 2P Pocket Game (the traditional mode) and 2P 9-Ball Game, where the premise is to sink 9 balls before the other player makes them first. If you prefer, test your target in Trick Game or even hear your favorite song in Jukebox.</desc>

Take one of the "fleet boats" and go on extended patrols of up to 2 months from Hawaii, Australia, or New Zealand.

A buncha slimy, horrible, totally gross and putrid monsters are taking over the bodies of the people who live here and they wanna build a weapon that's gonna take over the entire planet! Pretty cool, huh? Anyway, yours truly is the only one who can see 'em 'cause of my X-ray glasses - so it's up to me to stop 'em! I've gotta spraypaint things, get radical on my skateboard, use my trusty slingshot, and in general behave like a nuisance, man. Plus, with evil dudes like Nelson the bully and Sideshow Bob getting in my way, it's a good thing I've got the rest of the Simpsons to help me out! So if you're a decent person, a patriot, and somebody who cares about this sorry planet, you'll do the right thing. Save the Earth! BUY THIS GAME! Thanks, man!</desc>

		<desc>An important message from Bart Simpson: Yo! When I heard I'd won the Krusty the Clown art contest, I said, "Forget it, man. This is Bart Simpson you're talking to, and Bart Simpson never won anything in his life." But Krusty said it, so there's no way to deny it. My family and I get to go on this really cool worldwide Treasure Hunt - to China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood. And I need your help if I want to reach my final destination: a guest appearance on the Itchy and Scratchy Show. Here's the deal: I have to collect Krusty faces and Krusty products. The faces are worth bonuses and power-ups, and if I collect all the products I get a special reward. Oh yeah, one other thing: If somebody tries to mess with me, they'll wish they hadn't, because I'm taking along plenty of firecracker balls. And if that's not enough... let's just say Bartman has the power of flight. Any questions? Good. Wish me luck, man. I'm outta here. Your friend, Bart Simpson.</desc>

		<desc>The lost colony of Alterra is a completely man-made lifeworld abandoned long ago in a nearby galaxy. Alterra is actually five colonies in one. Each self-contained habitat has been separately bio-engineered by a powerful ecosystem generation network known as a Multiple Organism Unit Link. MORGUL, for short. Early colonists used MORGUL to render Alterra inhabitable. But a cataclysmic quake severed all system interface functions, and MORGUL murderously rebelled. The few colonists lucky enough to escape told a grim tale of a higher intelligence gone berserk.

For generations, mankind sought a return to Alterra. Finally, genetic science created a saviour: Turrican, a mutant warrior, bio-engineered for the task of planetary reclamation. In the meantime, MORGUL has diligently twisted Alterran life forms to his brutal, destructive purposes. Thus, Turrican's challenges consist in eliminating hostile organisms from Alterra's five multi-level worlds and, finally, destroying the three faces of MORGUL.</desc>

		<desc>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails.

But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet "Stalking" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat.

Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!</desc>

When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.

All of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a "tetris". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called "Easy Spin" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)</desc>

Your goal is to defeat the country of Cantun, which is run by terrorists and has become completely power hungry with an aim to take over the whole world.

You're shooting tanks, ships, aircraft carriers and trains while flying towards the impenetrable military base. You shoot crates to get pickups. If you shoot the crate when it is green you get a bomb pickup, if you shoot it when it is red you get a mini helicopter that attaches to one of your sides shooting sideways, and if you shoot it when it is white you get a mini helicopter shooting forward. If you shoot 10 crates with a yellow diamond shape you get an extra life.</desc>

		<name>Tiny Toon Adventures 2: Trouble in Wackyland</name>
		<desc>There is a new amusement park in Acme Acres, and everyone has been invited to visit by a "Secret Admirer".
There are five areas which the player can explore, each one starring a different character. Plucky rides a bumper car. Hamton rides a tricky train trip. Babs rides the rollercoaster. Furrball dodges Sweetie as he goes for a wild log ride. And Buster faces the thrills and chills of the Funhouse.
Each ride costs a certain amount of tickets, but as the player racks up points on the various rides, more tickets are earned. Eventually, when enough tickets have been earned, they can be saved until the player has enough to afford the entrance fee to the Funhouse, where Buster Bunny must then navigate numerous obstacles before squaring off with the "Secret Admirer", who turns out to be Montana Max.
Just like in the first game, Roderick Rat is there to try to interfere, plus other villain characters. Other Tiny Toon characters also make appearances in varying degrees.</desc>

You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

Players control Doug Quaid as he platform hops across Earth and Mars in search of his stolen memories and the responsible parties. A collection of police, soldiers, and creatures will try to stop him. Quaid's default attack is a strong punch, though guns can be knocked away from some guards and picked up for use. Cutscenes between certain levels tell the movie's plot, and feature likenesses of the actors from the film (including Arnold).</desc>

The arcade version was released in 1983. The simple gameplay, based on quick repeating button presses, set the basics for sequels and similar games in the genre for the next decades.

The NES version of Track &amp; Field was re-released in Europe in 1992 as Track &amp; Field in Barcelona by Kemco in the light of the 1992 Summer Olympics. The opening song for the NES version is the Chariots of Fire theme by Vangelis (which was also used in the arcade version's high score screen).</desc>

		<name>Wily &amp; Light's Rockboard: That's Paradise!!</name>
		<desc>Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise is a business simulation game in which the player chooses among several characters in the original Mega Man series and competes with other players or the computer AI in purchasing spaces of property. The characters include Roll, Dr. Light, Dr. Wily, Dr. Cossack, and Kalinka. Each participant is given a turn, moving a certain number of spaces on the board. If they land on a property square, they are given the option to buy it with a certain about of Zenny (the game's currency) .They can then charge other characters rent when they land on that building. However, other characters can also buy part of the same square, allowing each owner to charge a smaller amount of rent. Some squares contain cards that cause various effects on the board such as raising property prices or the development level of a building. The game's winning conditions can vary depending on the set rules. The winner may be the character with the most owned spaces, the most remaining Zenny, or the most developments.</desc>

		<desc>When Kuros last did battle with the Evil Wizard Malkil atop Icefire Mountain, he raised his Ironsword in triumph and glory... or so he thought. Suddenly, a powerful bolt of magic has robbed Kuros of his armor, memory, and honor. But the distant presence of evil stirs in his mind, leading him to the once fair city of Piedup, the very same place where the villainous soul of Malkil survives. Without his armor, Kuros will need crafty disguises to travel undetected, ready to do battle as a wizard, nobleman or thief. His quest will take him from the depths of the dungeon to the palace containing riches beyond belief - building strength, perfecting fighting skills and acquiring rare knowledge of magic along the way. The time has come for Kuros to turn his visions of power... into reality!</desc>

		<desc>IF YOU LIKE FIGHTING DIRTY, YOU'RE GONNA DIG ZEN!

The greatest environmental disaster in human history is about to hit your backyard. But you're not backing down, because you're Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who's come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies.

But wasting these slimeballs won't be easy. Because they'll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We're talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They're hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown!

There are 12 total levels, each with its own ecological enemies, toxic traps and pollution-fighting objectives. You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth.

Finally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth.

For 1 Ninja Master.</desc>

When the player places first, then they get a message: "It's a new record!" Additional points are earned by beating the previously-set record time.</desc>

		<desc>In the NES version of Family Feud, the game tried to recreate the look and feel from the original Richard Dawson-hosted series, even going as far as to include a Dawson-like host who kissed the female characters in the game. (This differed from the game's packaging, which used the set from the Ray Combs era.) One or two players could play.
Just like the show, the object was to come up with answers to survey questions posed to 100 people. Correct answers were worth money, with $200 winning the game and the right to play Fast Money for $5,000, which was played exactly the same way as on the show (at least 200 points needed to win). $5 a point was awarded for unsuccessful playings of the round.
A player entered his answers by using the controller to scroll through the alphabet, contained in a string along the bottom of the screen; the answer had to be completed within a time limit. Reasonable similies to correct answers were accepted, and slight misspellings were also recognized.
Once a player won, they were given two options. The first was to stop playing, with the other being to continue on. A champion retired after winning over $20,000 automatically unless they were defeated.
If a computer-controlled family wins the game, no Fast Money is played with an excuse given to the form of "Due to (EXCUSE), the (NAMES) will not be playing Fast Money today". Excuses used include "tax considerations" and "a birth in the family".</desc>

You are the elves’ last hope. Outside the town walls lurk monsters with the power to destroy anything in their path. Inside the walls, water and time are running out. Soon the ancient elf town of Eolis will vanish into eternity. Only you can save Eolis. No one else dares to venture beyond the walls, onto the World Tree, where towns and fortresses precariously await the whims of fate at the hands of the Evil.

You are searching for the water source and for an antidote to the poison that makes the water undrinkable. To find them you’ll need gold and food and magic, speed with a sword … and luck.

Every town holds a new mystery, every fortress a new danger. Merchants will sell you magic and valuable tools, but it’s up to you to figure out what you need. Long, secret mantras help you slip through the mists, but will you survive the next challenge?

This is Faxanadu, the legend, the adventure – the incredible journey on the World Tree.</desc>

		<desc>The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is a simplified version that allows players to practice up to six laps or qualify for every Formula One race of the season using metric units (kilometres per hour instead of miles per hour). It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.
Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

		<desc>In Fisher-Price: Firehouse Rescue, the player controls a fireman driving a firetruck. Both the fireman and the firetruck bear the familiar style of the popular Fisher-Price toy line. The object of the game is to rescue pets from trees and people from houses in the immediate neighborhood. There are 2 parts to this task: the first part involves navigating the maze-like streets from an overhead perspective in order to find the troubled residence. Once the house is reached, the second part of the job is to maneuver the firetruck's ladder underneath the person or animal in need of rescue, from a side perspective, and letting them down to safety.</desc>

		<name>Fist of the North Star</name>
		<desc>Fist of the North Star is a side-scrolling action game developed by Shouei System for the Nintendo Entertainment System, originally released in Japan by Toei Animation in 1987 and in North America by Taxan in 1989. The game is based on the manga series Fist of the North Star and is the second of four games based on the franchise that were released for the Family Computer in Japan and the only one with an overseas version. The game's plot is adapted from the second anime series, Hokuto no Ken 2, and covers the Gento Kōken story arc. The North American version is simply titled Fist of the North Star and is not to be confused with the original Hokuto no Ken for the Famicom, which was released exclusively in Japan. Despite being based on Hokuto no Ken 2, the North American cover artwork depicts Kenshiro fighting against Toki, who appears only in the first anime series.</desc>

		<name>Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll</name>
		<desc>In a mysterious region of China, Ryuhi, was born and raised in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. At a young age he became a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan No Sho, or Book of the Mind's Eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji as a last request from a dying Juan. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, and begins to train him in Shorinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming "World Tournament of Contact Sports" as a representative of Shorinji. His motive is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. After learning from Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls, he leaves for the World Tournament. There are two different types of gameplay. Journey levels are side-scrolling levels where Ryuhi must defeat five bosses and find certain items valuable to the mission. The tournament levels are where the player gets to fight one-on-one against enemies in the same way as the first game in the series released in 1985, Shanghai Kid. The player must go through the game twice to get the true ending. All six scrolls must be collected the first time through to get the first ending. The second time through the player needs to collect all six scrolls again, along with four crystal balls. The crystal balls can only be found in the second quest. However, players can miss one of these items and finish the game, but the true ending will not be received.</desc>

		<desc>In an unexplored region of China wrapped in mystery, Ryuhi, a boy, was born and brought up in high mountain tops. There he received instruction from his wise teacher, Juan. Though he was young, he made himself a master of Kempo. One day, his teacher Juan was attacked and robbed of the Secret Scrolls of Hiryu-no-Ken, of which he was the author. Ryuhi possessed the 6th volume of the Secret Scrolls, the Shingan-no Sho, or book of the mind's eye which Juan had managed to save. Ryuhi begins his journey to Shorinji in compliance with Juan's last request. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji welcomed the little Ryuhi, regarded as one of the titans of Shourinji Kempo. Six years later, they received a letter of challenge from the Tusk Soldiers, a mysterious organization of enemies of the Shorinji. Ryuhi is determined to take part in the upcoming "World Tournament of Contact Sports" as a representative of Shorinji. His desire is to prevent the Tusk Soldiers from becoming champions of Contact Sports at the tournament. Ryuhi heard from Gengai that in truth it was the Tusk Soldiers who attacked his teacher and robbed him of the Secret Scrolls. As he leaves for the World Tournament, his thoughts are on his teacher Juan and keeping the fighting spirit burning. The game features combat in a variety of formats, such as kicking and using fireballs to repel monsters in scrolling stages, a system during one-on-one duels against Tusk Soldiers or a pair of martial arts tournaments where the player must attack a mark that appears on their opponent's body, or defend the area when it appears on them (this system is similar to Culture Brain's original Flying Dragon for the NES), and RPG-style command battles against monster bosses. When confronted by a Tusk Soldier or other otherworldly villain, Rick can change into a costumed superhero form or switch with one of his teammates. The player must switch to Flying Warrior form to use the characters' magic powers and defend themselves from the Tusk Soldiers' magic spells.</desc>

For years the sun seemed to shine brighter and the crops grew taller than anyone could ever remember. Surely, their troubles were far behind them, and life was one blissful long walk through paradise. But, their wonderful world would be shattered in one mighty flash from the heavens. For lightning had struck the old tombstone that lay battered and overgrown with weeds in a dark corner of the ancient cemetary. And just as fiendish life had once been given to the dead, it would be given again. First a twitch of a finger, a flutter of a heartbeat, then a powerful surge of energy to the twisted criminal brain that so long ago had terrorized the land in the powerful body of the hideous monster. The horror was about to begin again... Frankenstein had risen from the dead!</desc>

The fun will have to wait. Jason has decided to come to camp and terror is the only game they'll be playing. Only you can stop this terror. You and your six camp counselors can prevent Jason from running wild. It's not an easy task. You must first fight your way through forests filled with man-eating wolves, caves covered with blood-sucking bats, and hordes of mindless zombies at every turn. If a friend is in danger it's up to you to help... or else you can just kiss them goodbye. Jason doesn't play favorites. He'll take anyone. Don't think that hiding in a cabin or staying adrift in a canoe will keep you safe. The only way to survive this summer is to challenge Jason, face to face, and destroy him. Don't worry that it hasn't been done before... there is always a first time (well, not always).</desc>

		<path>./Fun House (U) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Fun House</name>
		<desc>The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child's version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle).
In order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a "chance." Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.</desc>

		<path>./Galaga - Demons of Death (U) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Galaga</name>
		<desc>The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.
Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's "hit/miss ratio" at the end of the game, and a bonus "Challenging Stage" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.
Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a "boss Galaga" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.
Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous "Split-Screen bug" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game "rolls over" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.</desc>

		<desc>Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the "sport" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot. One hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.</desc>

However, a player can also change the way the gunman shoots through button combinations. A player can still die by getting shot or struck by enemies like in Commando but improve protection by getting special items, including a horse, for protection up to three hits; boots, for speed of movement; bullets, for faster shots; and rifles, for shot length. These items are found by shooting barrels and rifles, boots, and bullets can stock up to five.</desc>

This gameplay style is called a tube shooter, and Gyruss is one of the very few examples that exist. The familiar scrolling starfield of earlier space shooter games was arranged to fit the 3D perspective, with the stars coming into view at the centre of the screen and flying outward, giving the impression of the player's ship moving very fast through space.</desc>

		<desc>Gym rats, beware! HOOPS takes you out to the asphault, where basketball is a half-court game of fast hands, faster moves and slam-jam-thank-you-Sam dunks! The legends of the Playground are all here: Mr. Doc, Jammer, Legs, Bomber, Wiz, eight players in all. You can pit them one-on-one or two-on-two. You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer. You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you've been in a game after you've played a game of HOOPS!</desc>

		<desc>When nightmares come to life... You discover you're not immortal! You're a mighty wizard in search of your lost master, Mordamir. Venture into the dungeon and slove the mysteries of each level. Unravel the secrets of The Immortal!

The Immortal is an isometric action-adventure game.

Your old mentor Mordamir has disappeared. Probably kidnapped. You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of isometric death await.

The Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards.</desc>

Handpicked by the master himself, 18 of the greatest holes in golf have now been linked together, including the 14th at St. Andrews, 18th at Muirfield, and 12th at Royal Lytham. All the elements of the major championships are here as well - the harsh winds of Scotland, the lightning fast greens of Augusta, Oakmont's death traps and the great ocean hazard at Pebble Beach. Trees are everywhere. Birdies are few. Even pin placements change from round to round, making double bogeys as common as pars. Up to a foursome can compete, or you can go it alone against a computerized Golden Bear. You also have the option of playing a skins game or stroke play.</desc>

The weak side linebacker is lined up inside his defensive end. They're coming! You check-off the play at the line of scrimmage and call for a quick pass to the tight end. He breaks it for a T.D.! Named for the quarterback who twice won the AFC Player of the Year Award, this is the game made for every kid who ever wanted to play the game as well as John Elway!</desc>

		<name>The Jungle Book</name>
		<desc>A 2D platformer based on the 1967 animated Disney movie and released on multiple platforms. It was one of four Virgin Interactive platformers based on Disney movies, along with The Lion King, Aladdin and Pinocchio.

Walt Disney's The Jungle Book is a side-scrolling platformer based on the Disney film of the same name. As Mowgli, the player must make their way from Mowgli's home in the jungle to the human village. Along the way, he faces various dangers such as pitfalls, fruit-throwing monkeys, and spitting snakes. The ultimate objective is to defeat Shere Khan, a cunning tiger who hunts humans.

Virgin Interactive developed the game for multiple consoles, including the Game Boy, NES, SNES, Genesis, Sega Master System and Game Gear. It was part of a series of Disney licensed platformers they created in the mid-90s.</desc>

		<name>Jurassic Park</name>
		<desc>This game can be played in two modes, either as Dr. Alan Grant or as a Velociraptor. Playing as each provides the user with an alternative story and level design. The climax of the game mirrored the unused climax of the film, in which Grant must defeat a pair of Velociraptors by causing the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton in the Visitors Center to collapse on top of them. Grant himself is the final boss in the same location for the raptor storyline: your dinosaur character must cause the bone structure to collapse via specifically placed kicks to cause Grant to flee. A sequel was released using a new game engine and new artwork (with some of the original art as well), entitled Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. In it, Grant's helicopter (that he just escaped on in the first game) crashes. Now he must deal not only with dinosaurs, but InGen as well. A new raptor must also make it off the island.</desc>

The device can hold up to five blocks. A block which is not caught and placed in the playing area or pushed back up the belt is considered a drop. The blocks are solid colours, but there is also a flashing block which can be used as a wildcard on any colour.</desc>

Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six "G" vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights!</desc>

Without fuel they were nothing. Man began to feed on man. The gangs took over the highways, ready to wage war for a tank a gas. In the maelstrom of decay, ordinary men were smashed...men like Max -- a man who wondered out into the wasteland. And it was there, in that blighted place, that he learned what it takes to survive. 

And now it's your turn. Survive multiple levels of holocaust on the highways, mayhem in the mine-shafts, and anarchy in the arenas. Then face the final challenge -- if you dare.</desc>

Then the inevitable happened: Abadon, one of the most powerful magicians, decided that has was tired of always helping the people. He figured that with a little help, he could easily take over; and so he built a massive castle, and conjured up all sorts of evil beasts to destroy the other wizards.
Now the people of Merlwood are defenseless, and Abadon's followers are running rampant. Their only hope lies in you, Paul, a young apprentice magician. Your mission will be long and difficult, filled with epic battles and magic spells. Along the way, you will meet many friends who can teach you spells and give you scrolls. But to defeat Abadon, you will need the Ultimate Potion.
Legends say that if the four vials of the elements can be brought together, the Ultimate Potion will be formed. You must seek out the vials of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water, form them into the Ultimate Potion, and confront Abadon!</desc>

		<desc>It's you against the evil Mother Brain in the thrilling battle of Metroid!

You’re inside the fortress planet Zebes.  The planet of endless secret passageways where the Metroid are multiplying.  Left alone the Metroid are harmless.  But in the wrong hands they could destroy the galaxy.  It’s up to you to prevent the Mother Brain that controls Zebes from using the Metroid for evil purposes.  But that won’t be easy.  You’ll have to use your spacesuit to absorb valuable energy for your search to gain the use of power items like the Ice Beam, Wave Beam, High Jump Boots and Varia.  If you survive, it will be you and your acquired powers against the Mother Brain.

Worth Noting: 
Metroid introduced nonlinear, side-scroller, maze-like, gameplay, in a platform, shooter. Metroid required players to discover permanent power-ups to progress further along; while backtracking through previously visited areas. The style is affectionately known as Metroid-vania' (Castlevania: Symphony of the Night being the second half to the term, mirrored the concept).

Metroid also used a password system to resume progression of the game (Before the addition of battery backups and save files in console cartridges). Additionally the password system could be used for cheat codes: 'JUSTIN BAILEY ------ ------' (Just in Ballet) being famous, would remove Samus' power suit and start the player with many of the power-ups and fairly progressed through the game.

Completing the game in time and with enough power-ups revealed different endings. At the end Samus removes the helmet or power suit (depending) to a reveal a shocking suprise that endeared the character and broke new ground in gaming.</desc>

Earwig: same as the scorpion in Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
Bee: same as the flea in Centipede, dropping mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to kill.
Spider: same behavior as in Centipede, bouncing irregularly across the lower portion of the screen. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
Inchworm: when hit, slows all enemies for a short period of time.
Beetle: crawls around the player area for a while, then climbs up and leaves the screen, turning any mushrooms it touches into indestructible flowers. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.
Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.
DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.
All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.</desc>

Ultra® Dares you to defy the impossible.  But if you accept, be forewarned.  You and your trio of Impossible Mission Force agents will infiltrate a six level maze of unthinkable danger.  A fortress of international evil designed to sap every ounce of your brains and brawn.  At each turn you must fend off snipers and fire bomb maniacs.  Elude spy cameras and robot sentries.  Escape from countless enemies in hot pursuit.  All in your desperate search for booby-trapped clues, secret ID cards and life-saving switches.
  Any why?  Because the worldwide terrors known as the Sinister Seven have kidnapped Dr. "O," his nuclear military defense system and IMF agent Shannon Reed, and now they threaten to wreak planetary chaos.
  Luckly, your agents are well schooled in the art of espionage and possess their own favored firepower, from rifles to remote control cluster bombs.  But that's no guarantee you'll make it past brutes like Slash Stiletto, Blitz Blizzardski and the Iron Claw.  If by chance you do, there's always the hyper speedboat chases through Venice, hand grenade ski runs down the Swiss Alps, and prison camps in the Pyrenees mountains.
  Remember, should you choose to accept this mission and fail, you, your Nintendo®, and the world will self-destruct in five seconds.</desc>

While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.</desc>

You can select any of the American and National Conference teams, and if you're good enough, you can take them all the way to the Super Bowl! Team rosters are broken down into positions and individually rated according to skills, with position upgrade packages, player ability handicapping, actual NFL Offensive and Defensive Playbook alignments with audibles and even variable wind direction and strength. You not only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one football game you've got to have!</desc>

		<desc>Something frightening has been happening on Elm Street lately. It seems that with each waking day another grussome discovery is made... another neighborhood teen has mysteriously passed away into the dark stillness of the night. Everyone says it's "natural causes," but it seems as if something (or someone) has been picking them off one by one in their sleep. It's a horrible nightmare come true... and this nightmare has a name: Freddy Krueger.

It's up to you and your remaining friends to search Elm Street for his bones, which have been scattered about then collect and burn them in the High School furnace. If you can just stay awake long enough, you might be able to end Freddy's reign of terror for good. You had better hurry though, it's getting late and you can feel your eyelids getting heavier and heavier by the minute.</desc>

But Sutekh's seedy underworld is about to be infiltrated by a superhero unlike any the world has ever seen. A superhero who can melt into the darkness like a phantom. By day this brave new crimefighter is a common ordinary citizen. But when night falls, he is cloaked in a secret identity to seek out and destroy the dark forces that lurk on midnight streets. Who is this man the press calls Nightshade? Only you can answer that... for he is you! Every night you solidify your superhero status, patrolling 100 of the city's darkest corners. Here you'll find thieves, muggers, and other alley scum that you must either deal with or destroy for clues. But be warned. You're not the only night stalker. For as you hunt Sutekh, Sutekh hunts you with the human printing press, the closing wall of spikes, deadly jackal pits, and the chilling freeze ray. Of course the ultimate key to destroying Sutekh is your popularity. For it's a power source that gives you the wit to decipher clues and the strength to pulverize villains and rescue innocent bystanders. Remember, if this heroic prowess ever diminishes, you'll no longer control the night. You'll be consumed by it.</desc>

		<name>Ninja JaJaMaru-kun</name>
		<desc>The game stars the brother of Ninja-kun (from Ninja-Kid). Princess Sakura has been kidnapped by Damazu-Dayuu, and because Ninja-Kun is away on a journey, the task falls to young JaJaMaru-kun.

In the game, the player starts with three lives and can only run, jump and throw shurikens. The game is divided into stages, each with four floors and eight enemies. Sakura-Hime and Damazu are placed, unreachable, at the top of the screen. Enemies use various projectiles, one of which will cause the player to lose a life. If JaJaMaru-kun lands on top of an enemy, it will simply be temporarily stunned and vice versa. Once an enemy is defeated and offscreen, a spirit will appear and ascend to the top of the screen. It can be collected before it has disappeared to receive points, which vary depending on the enemy. Sakura will sometimes drop petals that the player can collect, and Damazu will sometimes run around, dropping bombs. To advance to the next stage, the player must defeat all eight enemies by using shurikens.

Some bricks yield items. They include:

    A cart that temporarily makes JaJaMaru-kun invincible and faster. Projectiles and enemies will also be destroyed if touched.
    A bottled substance that makes JaJaMaru temporarily invincible and able to walk through enemies.
    A red ball that increases speed.
    Bombs (which must be avoided).
    Coins that yield various amounts of points.
    An extra life.

If all three types of power-ups are collected, Gamapa-kun, a giant frog, will be summoned, which is completely invincible and able to eat all enemies. If three of Sakura's petals are collected, the player will go to a bonus stage in which JaJaMaru-kun is on the bottom and Damazu at the top. Damazu drops bombs, and the player throws shurikens upward. If the player manages to hit Damazu, bonus points are awarded. If the JaJaMaru-kun is hit by a bomb, he goes on to the next stage.</desc>

After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again fluorished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet.

These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or centers, of the eight nuclear explosions which nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction...And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again!

The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the eight Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards.

Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return on the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the the eternal gratitude of all mankind!</desc>

		<desc>The dragonmen have taken Solace. Its beautiful tree houses lie black and battered amid the stumps of great vallenwood trees. Kapak Draconians, armed with poisoned weapons, enforce a crutal martial law on the survivors.

And Solace is only one outpost: the dragonarmies control the plains. Only the elven kingdom of Qualinesti stands unconquered. The rest of the plainsmen suffer the most: a long slave caravan hauls hundreds of them to the fortress prison of Pax Tharkas.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Heroes of the Lance</name>
		<desc>While Heroes of the Lance is a faithful representation of the books it is based on, it was a departure from the usual RPG style of most Dungeons &amp; Dragons games, and many players lamented its difficult game play interface which consists of using one character at a time in horizontally-scrolling fighting. Each character has different types of attacks and spells making them more suited to fighting different enemies but they merely act as "lives" for the player as in more traditional fighting games, removing one of the main strategies of role-playing games from the game.</desc>

		<name>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Pool of Radiance</name>
		<desc>Pool of Radiance takes place in the Forgotten Realms fantasy world. The main setting is the city of Phlan, located on the northern shore of the Moonsea, situated between Zhentil Keep and Melvaunt. The party begins in the civilized section of "New Phlan" that is governed by a council. This portion of the city hosts businesses, including shopkeepers who sell holy items for each temple's worshipers, a jewelry shop, and retailers who provide arms and armor. A party can also contract with the clerk of the city council for various commissions; proclamations fastened to the halls within City Hall offer bits of information to aid the party. These coded clues can be deciphered by using the Adventurer's Journal, included with the game.</desc>

		<desc>The player must earn money in order to become the wealthiest gambler in the world. The game, set in New York City, is considered a spin-off from the Pachio-kun franchise. Al Capone has a cameo role in this game even though he lived about one thousand miles to the west (Chicago) in real life.
Roads, taxis and automobiles are not portrayed in the game. However, a black limousine that escorts the player from the air force base to the final casino is portrayed as driving on grass. This is in direct opposition to the real New York City where the majority of the surface is concrete (either as roads, parking lots, or as foundations for the buildings). Only parks and some older residential districts use grass in their design in the real world. Buildings are either shown as dilapidated tenements, shiny towers, or as flashy casinos.
An English language translation was made in 2007 by a ROM hacker who goes by the nickname of "Pale Dim." Using the game's upper case letters that resemble the Joystix font, the English translation allows players in English-speaking countries to better understand the game. One of the changes made was to change the explosion sound from the Japanese Bom to the English Boom.</desc>

		<desc>Antarctic Adventure, known in Japan as Kekkyoku Nankyoku Daibōken is a video game developed by Konami in 1983 for MSX, and later for video game consoles, such as NES. The player takes the role of an Antarctic penguin, racing to disparate research stations owned by different countries in Antarctica (excluding the USSR).

The gameplay is similar to Sega's Turbo, but plays at a much slower pace, and features platform game elements. The penguin, later named Penta, must reach the next station before time runs out while avoiding sea lions and breaks in the ice. Throughout the levels, fish jump out of ice holes and can be caught for bonus points. The game, like many early video games, has no ending – when the player reaches the last station, the game starts from the first level again, but with increased difficulty.</desc>

		<desc>Argus is a vertical shooter by Jaleco and conversion of an arcade game originally released in 1986. The players takes control of a space-fighter equipped with a front laser gun and ground bombs. Although the game features power-ups, they follow an unusual and unique formula - tiles on the ground must be destroyed in order to upgrade the main weapon or trigger special events. 

However, three of these tiles must be destroyed to activate such power-ups - B creates a temporary barrier around the ship,P upgrades the primary weapon and L gives the player an extra bonus at the end of each stage. Another interesting twist to the game is the Uoru armor; a shadow sometimes appear on the ground and if the player aligns his own shadow with it, then the ship transforms into a powerful robot for a short amount of time. Each stage ends with the same boss battle; a large Mega Argus fortress with a slow flashing core at its center, and the only way to destroy this pernicious mothership is to bomb its core when it is fully exposed. After the boss is taken care of, the player must successfully land on a runway and be cautious not to crash the ship. Argus features nine levels and includes a two-player alternating option.</desc>

		<desc>Battle Wings, known in Japan either as B-Wing, is a vertically scrolling shooter first released as an arcade game by Data East in 1984. The game was ported by Data East to the Family Computer in 1986, and was Data East's very first home release for this platform.

The game consists of 45 levels (30 in the Family Computer version), and no background story or plot is given. The player controls a ship called the FX-1, and collects power-up parts (called a "wing") to progress through the levels and ultimately defeat the Gobunasu armored mobile fortress in the final level. The game consists of two different top-view screen levels, where the player can press the second button to descend to the ground whenever they do not have a power-up. The player is unaffected by attacks from airborne units while they are playing on the ground level, but the ship is automatically brought back into the air after a certain period of time. The player can still be hit by attacks from ground units while they are on the ground level, and can also lose their ship by crashing into obstacles. The 8-way joystick controls the player's movements, and one button is used for shooting, and the other is used for descending to the ground (or un-equipping wings). The background image continues infinitely when the player scrolls in the horizontal directions.

Completing the final level of the game causes the score counter to increase to 9,999,999 points, which the player can enter as their high score. The player can also score cheap points by equipping and un-equipping their power-up. Pressing the button twice while the un-equipping animation is occurring cause the player to gain 2,000 points. The player gains an extra life every 40,000 points, so it is possible to gain lives almost infinitely. If the player gains over 10,000,000 points in this way before completing the final level, the counter takes over 20 minutes to increase to 99,999,999 points.</desc>

		<desc>In the beginning, an archaeologist and explorer known as Indiana Borgnine (インディー・ボーグナイン?), is in search of the fabled Hanging Gardens of Babylon. After reading some lost scriptures, he determines that the only way to see them is to travel to the very top of the 64-story Tower of Babel. Upon reaching the Tower, he discovers that the only way to access the floors above him are to solve some challenging puzzles involving loose L-shaped blocks that he finds throughout the Tower. To his great surprise, the blocks are capable of balancing very well on top of one another, in order to form staircases.</desc>

		<name>Bakushou! Star Monomane Shitenou</name>
		<desc>Bakushō! Star Monomane Shitennō (爆笑!　スターものまね四天王?, "A Hearty Laugh! Imitation of the Four Heavenly Kings Star") is a Nintendo Family Computer life simulation video game that portrays the life of either a musician or a famous performer of the monomane (模倣?, "imitation") style of Japanese theatre. The object is to earn popularity while performing concert tours through the fictional city. Celebrity challenges are included in the game; they are considered to be miniature games like swimming and kicking a giant ball into a goal in a manner similar to soccer. While these games are fun to play, losing results in a loss of popularity points similar to performing terribly at a concert.

Appeasing senior citizens by performing gigs at the nursing home is another way to gain popularity. Otherwise, they will criticize the player's music or theatre styles without an end. After gaining the respect of the elderly, the mad faces eventually turn into frowns (and eventually smiles). Television appearances come in the form of talent shows, televised concerts, and several other surprises. The eventual goal is to convert all stadiums and concert venues to the player's colors. In addition to popularity meters for the players, music styles have their own popularity meters. Smiles with the player's colors determine which music styles are best liked by the player's fans. This determine what music or theatre styles to play and which ones to avoid in certain concert venues.

In the talent contest, the show is like a tournament where four people compete in a semi-final format. After the judges give their score, the two players with the lowest score are eliminated. The players with the highest score end up competing in a final round where the highest scoring player is the winner and receives popularity points. During the actual performance, the player must choose his or her musical style(s) and must improvise the lyrics. During a televised concert, the game proceeds like in a normal concert. The only difference is that an increased number of popularity points are rewarded for a successful concert.

When the player draws a certain combination on the dice, he or she must go to a nursing home and impress a grandmother with his or her musical or theatre styles. If the player can impress the grandmother with his or her music, then the player is accepted more by the elderly people. However, the elderly people can get grumpy again if the player manages to make the grandmother angry each time that the player has to perform at the nursing home again. All the text in the game is in Japanese. Other combinations of the letter and number dice can create or ruin a player's popularity along with other side effects.

The dice combination "A-1" is the best combination and it causes a rapid rise in popularity, which means more fans show up to the lucky person's concerts. Getting an "F-5" is the worst combination and will result in a loss of popularity. However, all other combinations can have either negative, neutral, or positive results for the player. Guessing about the result of the dice throw is all the fun of trying to get popularity for the band and greater appreciation from different age groups.</desc>

		<desc>Bakushou!! Ai no Gekijou ("A Hearty Laugh! Theater of Love") is a virtual life board game developed and published for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Coconuts Japan Entertainment on Dec 29th, 1990 in Japan.

Capitalizing on the popularity of simulation and dating games from the late eighties, specifically the Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou series developed by Taito, this game follows many of the genre's tropes from chance rolls dictating life events, to gathering money and physical traits that benefit the player's life. Unlike the Jinsei Gekijou series however, Ai no Gekijou opts to focus on teenage life and romance in particular, rather than the wider scope seen in other life-simulation titles.</desc>

		<name>Ballblazer</name>
		<desc>Ballblazer is a simple one-on-one sports-style game bearing similarities to basketball and soccer. Each side is represented by a craft called a "rotofoil", which can be controlled by either a human player or a computer-controlled "droid" with ten levels of difficulty. (The game allows for human vs. human, human vs. droid, and droid vs. droid matches.) The basic objective of the game is to score points by either firing or carrying a floating ball into the opponent's goal. The game takes place on a flat, checkerboard playfield, and each player's half of the screen is presented in a first-person perspective.

A player can gain possession of the ball by simply running into it, at which point it is held in a force field in front of the craft. The opponent can attempt to knock the ball away from the player using the fire button, and the player in possession of the ball can also fire the ball toward the goal. When a player does not have possession of the ball, his or her rotofoil automatically turns at 90-degree intervals to face the ball, while possessing the ball turns the player toward the opponent's goal. The goalposts move from side to side at each end of the playfield, and as goals are scored, the goal becomes narrower.

Pushing the ball through the goal scores one point, firing the ball through the posts from close range scores two points, and successfully scoring from long range (where the goalposts are not visible) scores three points. The maximum number of total points between the two players is ten, meaning that any points scored that would take the combined total above ten will cause the opponent's score to be reduced by the same amount, resulting in a kind of tug of war scoring system. The game ends when either a player successfully scores ten points or the timer runs out. If time runs out and the score is tied, the game goes into "sudden death", where the first player to score wins.</desc>

Then, one night the town militiamen all disappeared. The future of Skara Brae hung in the balance. And who was left to resist? Only a handful of unproven young Warriors, junior Magic Users, a couple of Bards barely old enough to drink, and some out of work Rogues. You are there. You are the leader of this ragtag group of freedom fighters. Luckily you have a Bard with you to sing your glories, if you survive. For this is the stuff of legends. And so the story begins...</desc>

		<name>Binary Land</name>
		<desc>Binary Land is a puzzle video game developed by Hudson Soft in 1983 for the MSX, FM-7, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, and in 1985 for the Famicom. The MSX version saw release in Japan by Kuma Computers Ltd in 1984.

While the Famicom version has a grand total of 99 levels; there is no ending screen implemented in the game.

In the Famicom version of the game, players have to unite two penguins, Gurin (male) and Malon (female), who are in love. The MSX version features a human boy and a human girl; gameplay remains identical to the Famicom version. Players control Malon and Gurin simultaneously; with a timer adding to the difficulty. These penguins move in mirror images of each other. The game features many different stages. After completing the 17th stage, players have to start over again on stage 1. "Je te veux" by Erik Satie is the background music in the game during the levels. Upon uniting the two penguins, Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" is played.

A top-down view is utilized in the game; similar to the method used in The Adventures of Lolo. Standing in their way are spiders, birds and other creatures which the player must attack with the penguins' spray. Cobwebs occupy some of the cells on the playing field; possibly slowing the player down long enough for a spider to kill either Gurin or Malon. With each level arranged on a 10-by-15 grid and a vertical wall separating the two penguins from each other, only the upper central cell is free for both characters to reach. This "free cell" always holds the caged heart that is required to complete the level. A row of walls surrounding each player in a maze-like environment. In order to make the challenges more difficult; they are unbalanced and offer a different experience for Gurin and Malon.</desc>

The player must feed butterflies to the baby birds so that they can grow big and eventually leave the nest. It is suggested that they eventually become the "new mother birds" that take care of their offspring in the subsequent levels. Finishing all 999 levels of Bird Week actually results in the beginning of an endless loop instead that ends when the players loses all of his lives.

Each level represents a season in the ecosystem of a bird. The game starts out in early spring. As the virtual year progresses, the season evolves into summer and eventually into autumn. After autumn, the game repeats itself by portraying the following spring. If the proper amount of butterflies are not fed to the babies, then the babies end up starving to death. The player will automatically lose a life if any of the baby birds die. In addition to this, the player also loses a life when a predator catches the player trying to deliver butterflies to whose baby.</desc>

The player must make sure that the leader stays alive, until the army reaches the enemy castle to defeat the leader of the opposing forces.

The game was responsible for laying the foundations for the tactical role-playing game genre, or the "simulation RPG" genre as it is known in Japan, with its blend of role-playing and strategy game elements. The game has also variously been described as an early example of an action role-playing game, an early prototype real-time strategy game, and a unique reverse tower defense game. In its time, the game was considered a major success in Japan.</desc>

		<desc>During the prehistoric era of humanity, cavemen and dinosaurs compete for ultimate supremacy. A young boy has to collect important treasure without being killed by the rampaging dinosaurs. All he can do is attempt to temporarily paralyze them with a specialized dinosaur trap. All treasures must be collected before admittance to the next level is possible. One hit from either a dinosaur, caveman, or other type of enemy instantly kills the player.

Levels range from the conventional cavemen setting of the earlier levels to feudal Japan and even some futuristic levels inspired by science fiction.[4] There are 21 levels in this game with five different bonus levels to gain extra points in. Objects to acquire in the other time zones include radios (retrieved in the World War II stages from Japanese soldiers), bags of money (retrieved in the modern levels while dodging criminals and police officers), computer monitors (earned while dodging robots) and ancient Japanese scrolls (found while avoiding samurai).[</desc>

		<desc>BUCKY'S GONNA NEED A LOT OF LUCK FROM HIS RABBIT'S FOOT!

Today's newest renegade space hero, Captain Bucky O'Hare, faces his greatest challenge. His crew, Dead Eye Duck, Blinky, Jenny the Aldeberan Cat and the genius earth boy Willy DuWitt, have been captured by the Toad Empire. Now you must play the role of Bucky, blasting past the fiercest toads in the Aniverse. It's an intense arcade action battle with eight hare-raising levels. Luckily, when you rescue a crew member you can assume their identity and take advantage of their unique fighting skills, like Jenny's Super Mind Blast and Willy's Laser Cannon... WE INTERUPT THIS PACKAGE FOR A SPECIAL BULLETIN FROM TOAD HEADQUARTERS!

Greetings, warthead. This is the Toad Air Marshall, coming to you live from the Toad Magma Tanker. I'm here to smash an ugly rumor goin' around that says you're thinking about becoming Bucky O'Hare in a futile attempt to rescue the captured crew of the Righteous Ingignation.

Fool! Those lunkhead traitors are guided by the elite Storm Toad Troopers in four toad prisons hidden throughout the planetoid belt, from the Way-Cool Ice Planet to the Burnin' Hunk of Lava Star. So don't even mess with us toads, you wart for brains hare-ball. 'Cause it you do, I'll have to blast ya Toad Battle Cruisers and Double Bubble High Speed Toad Armada Tanks. That ain't the worst of it, pal! Once I've got your pointy ears in my sights, I'll drop the big bomb with Crater Centipedes, Robosnakes and triple threat Triborgs that your laser-guided Wart Remover doesn't have a shot against.

Face it rabbit. Try to croak us toads, and you'll be one unlucky Bucky!</desc>

The setting for Burai Fighter, according to the manual, is to fend off seven bases of Burai, super-intelligent cyborgs.  The player starts out with a relatively weak cannon but can upgrade to ring, laser and missile weapons, which are much more powerful.  The player can also choose from three difficulty settings: Eagle, Albatross and Ace, but the fourth difficulty setting, Ultimate, must be unlocked.  One proceeds by controlling the character in 8 directions and can shoot in a different direction from the direction he is looking.</desc>

To properly make a hamburger you must assemble all of the ingredients together, dropping them from higher up onto the the burger area below. To actually do this you have to let Chef Pepper step all over the burger ingredients. As soon as an ingredient (a piece of lettuce for instance) has been stepped on, it will fall to the next level below. Falling food will squish any enemy following you and will also"bump" any other ingredient bellow it farther down. Also, as an emergency defense against the enemy food, you can collect pepper shakers which will allow you to puff out a small pepper cloud which will momentarily stun enemies, allowing you to walk past them.</desc>

The game's plot is not an adaptation of the movie, but rather serves as an original continuation to the film's events.  The story begins when Rufus summons Bill S. Preston Esq. and "Ted" Theodore Logan for a mission.  Both boys arrive at different times; first Ted then Bill.  They are informed that time-space rebels have gone back in time, kidnapping various historical figures and leaving them stranded in different time periods.  So now they must travel to the time periods, retrieve these figures and return them to their correct time periods.  This must be done as soon as possible; for if history isn't made right, the boys will miss the big concert that will launch Wyld Stallyns' music career.  Unfortunately, Rufus can only loan out a pay phonebooth for this trip.  Once the mission is explained, Ted leaves and Bill arrives later.  Rufus states that since they both came alone, it's best that they work separately.  From there Bill is brought up to speed on the situation.  Bill is instructed to go back in time and leave items to help Ted along the way in each time period he visits.  When Bill has done this he will start his own search.  Ted will also do the same for Bill's search after he has found a historical figure.</desc>

		<name>Chack'n Pop</name>
		<desc>Chack'n, a small yellow creature (later recolored green) with extendable legs must traverse a series of single-screen mazes. He is capable of walking on floors or ceilings but not walls. He can climb steps and traverse high walls by extending his legs until he is tall enough to pass onto the next step. He is capable of throwing hand grenades to his left or right which, after a short period, explode into a cloud of smoke. Separate fire buttons control rolling to the left or right. Chack'n is killed if caught by the explosion cloud.

Each screen is played against a time limit, marked by a Mighta pushing a boulder along the top of the screen. The Mighta reappears in Bubble Bobble as a recurring enemy.

Chack'n's aim is to reach the top of the screen before the time limit expires. He is delayed in this process by a series of solid walls. In order to get past the walls, he must free hearts from cages using his hand grenades.

A further obstruction comes in the form of Monstas (same creatures to appear in Bubble Bobble) hatching from eggs. Hand grenades can also be used to destroy the creatures or the eggs producing them (however, the player will get bonus points after completing the level for not destroying any enemies). Later levels include moving platforms and, reminiscent of Bubble Bobble, water bottles that when blown up flood the level with water. The water does not destroy anything or in any way inhibit the movement of the enemies, but it allows Chack'n to swim to otherwise unreachable platforms.

Once all the levels are completed, Chack'n is able to marry his girlfriend, Miss Chack'n.</desc>

The player must collect the hostages and transport them safely to the nearby friendly base, all the while fighting off hostile tanks and other enemy combatants. According to the back story, the helicopter parts were smuggled into the country described as "mail sorting equipment."

In 1986, ports of the arcade version back to home versions were developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Master System. These versions include some game play and scoring changes of their own, but use the environments, music, and approximate score play of the arcade remake.</desc>

		<name>Chuugoku Senseijutsu</name>
		<desc>A fortune-telling simulator for the NES developed by Sanritsu and Aicom and published by Jaleco.

A fortune-telling game that uses Eastern mysticism to prognosticate on the player's future, based on their year of birth. Though fortune-telling devices weren't unheard of, this was the first NES "game" to provide such a service. It would, however, be followed almost immediately with Induction Produce's '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai; another fortune-telling interactive simulator.

The player can choose to receive their fortune in distinct areas of their lives, including romantic prospects, the best time to marry their partner and the outcome of their future business dealings. Due to the minimal impact and relative obscurity of Eastern horoscopes in the west, the game was never released outside of Japan, though the US would eventually receive their own equivalent with Taboo: The Sixth Sense.</desc>

		<desc>CITY ADVENTURE touch MYSTERY OF TRIANGLE is an action game for the Famicom and NES system that was published by Toho in 1987. The game is based on the high school and baseball team themed manga Touch. City Adventure Touch is somewhat notorious in Japan for bearing absolutely no resemblance to the source material. A comic book concerning the Mystery of Triangle is included in the manual. The story appears to revolve around a character's dog who disappears into an alternate dimension, and the three children who attempt to rescue it, one of which attacks by throwing baseballs.</desc>

		<desc>The main character in the game is a female driver, Clarice, of a Honda City (the North American version features a male driver) on a tour of all the sights and roads across the world. To prove that she has visited a particular location, she must drive around the location painting every section of the road white. However, the police, who have no tolerance for vandalism, attempt to stop the driver from completing her goal. The player's car can jump and fire cans of oil. To avoid forcing the player from retracing the same roads again, the roads change color when the car drives over them, indicating that that specific road has been painted. There are three main obstacles: police, cats and spikes. The police chase after the car and if a police car comes into contact with the main character's car, the car "explodes" by turning into a group of hearts and the player loses a life. To combat this, the player can obtain cans of oil, which can be used to cause the police cars to spin out of control, allowing the player to bump them off the screen. Other enemies include a cat, which, when hit, causes the player to lose an extra life as the cat goes diagonally off the screen (but does not cause the car to "explode") with playing of a comical music, "Der Flohwalzer", known as "Neko Funjatta" (I Stepped on the Cat) in Japan. There is also spikes, which make the car "explode" on contact. Occasionally, a balloon may float by during any given stage. If the car touches one of these balloons, it collects it and collecting three such balloons will activate a warp that sends the car multiple stages ahead and provides significant bonus points. Although the city you travel to will change, the difficulty pattern of the road will remain the same. As the number of cities you travel to loop endlessly, the game is not shortened by taking a warp. One particular thing about this game is the "catchy" tune that plays in the background as you enter a new city. Although it uses "ethnic" variations according to the destination, it's an adaptation of a famous classic piece, "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso", from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.</desc>

The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and "cosmo points" - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character's special attacks.

The game's world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.</desc>

		<desc>In Crazy Climber the player assumes the role of a daredevil who is attempting to climb to the top of four skyscrapers. There are a number of obstacles and dangers to avoid including:

    Windows that open and close (the most common danger).
    Bald-headed residents (a.k.a. Mad Doctors), who throw objects such as flower pots, buckets of water and fruit in an effort to knock the climber off the building (with larger objects appearing by more aggressive Mad Doctors in later levels).
    A giant condor, who drops eggs and excrement aimed at the climber (two at a time in the early stages, four in later levels).
    A giant ape (styled like King Kong), whose punch can prove deadly (he becomes more aggressive in later levels).
    Falling steel girders and iron dumbbells (more numerous in the later levels).
    Live wires, which protrude off electric signs.
    Falling 'Crazy Climber' signs.

Some of these dangers appear at every level of the game; others make appearances only in later stages. Should the climber succumb to any one of these dangers, a new climber takes his place at the exact point where he fell; the last major danger is eliminated.

One ally the climber has is a pink "Lucky Balloon"; if he is able to grab it, the climber is transported up 8 stories to a window. The window onto which it drops the climber may be about to close. If the window that the climber is dropped onto is fully closed, the balloon pauses there until the window opens up again. The player does not actually earn bonus points for catching the balloon, but he is awarded the normal 'step value' for each of the eight floors that he passes while holding the balloon.

If the climber is able to ascend to the top of a skyscraper and grabs the runner of a waiting helicopter, he earns a bonus and is transported to another skyscraper, which presents more dangers than the past. The helicopter would only wait about 30 seconds, then fly off.

If the player completes all four skyscrapers, he is taken back to the first skyscraper and the game restarts from the beginning, but the player keeps his score.</desc>

		<name>Metro-Cross</name>
		<desc>The player must take control of a man known only as Runner, who is given a time limit to run through each of the game's thirty-two rounds while avoiding obstacles and collecting drink cans. The actual running happens automatically: the job of the player is to avoid the obstacles and collect the cans by moving the Runner with the stick and adjusting his speed accordingly.

If the Runner finishes the round within the time limit, the remaining time will be awarded to him as bonus points and he will proceed to the next round. Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous ones as additional time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round by the time the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game will immediately be over.

Obstacles along the way include Slip Zones which will slow the Runner down if he tries to cross over them, Pitfalls which will break under the Runner's weight and drop him into the holes beneath them, and Crackers which will launch the Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards the Runner, Walls that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down, and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.

The rounds also feature Springboards, which can be used to propel the Runner forward at a great speed. Some rounds have a special layout of Springboards, where it is possible to use one Springboard to land directly on the second one. Some other rounds also feature Skateboards which will speed the Runner up and make him immune to Slip Zones. There are also two different types of drink cans; kicking them will either gain the player bonus points (from 100 to 5000) or speed the Runner up, but jumping on them will stop the timer for a few seconds.</desc>

		<name>Cycle Race: Road Man</name>
		<desc>It is the player's ultimate objective to make it all the way around Japan. If the player ends up completely damaging the bicycle, running out of energy, or falling behind a certain ranking, then he or she will automatically lose the race. Players can choose a representative from either Team USA, Team Japan, Team France, or Team Italy. As long as the player has at least one spare bicycle in the inventory, games will never end on a completely damaged bicycle. Passwords are used to save the game.

The race is 4,000 kilometers long (2485.5 miles). Players must traverse the countryside that separates major Japanese cities along the coastline during the course of these 4,000 kilometres. Interesting scenery includes forests and cattle farms.

Players are always given the exact altitude of each section; they are also shown how far in a stage the player has to advance in order to reach the finish line.</desc>

These robots are built in factories that assign the robot a name in addition to installing its head, body, shoulder, and feet. The player has a pre-game lobby to get ready for the robot combat action. All matches have rounds of 60 seconds (unlike the 99-second round of most modern fighting video games). Both robots have a separate gauge for energy and damage. Standard punches and kicks can be thrown in addition to special moves (which look like ammunition).</desc>

It was released only in Japan by Bandai on December 29, 1992, for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

For the PK Battle modes, each player must select a different team. He must then scan a player card (not a team card), and then that player will have a chance to kick a penalty kick (if it is his turn). For all other modes, the player must scan a team card and that will be the team that he will play as for the game(s). The main mode of play is the J.LEAGUE mode, of course. It is set up in a season/tournament setting, with 18 games per team. There are ten teams total in this version of J.League, and they are randomly sorted to play against a different team each day. The games are split into two periods with three minutes (3:00) apiece. Prior to starting a game, the player can choose the formation of his eleven active players, from one of three layouts that he can see on the small screen (4-4-2, 4-3-3, or 3-5-2).</desc>

		<desc>Deep Dungeon IV: Kuro no Yōjutsushi (ディープダンジョンIV 黒の妖術師?, lit. Deep Dungeon IV: The Black Sorcerer) is the fourth and final installment in the Deep Dungeon series.

Unfortunately this game has removed the custom character feature of the previous game. Through the game, the player will meet up to two additional playable characters with predetermined class. This game also reverts to the standard practice or randomizing characters' stat growth when gaining an experience level. New to this engine is that the player can eventually learn to summon two monsters to function as a temporary additional party member for a single battle. It also removed the feature that stops random battles when the player is significantly more powerful than the enemies. This isn't as bad as it seems as the maps in this game are also much smaller (whereas the previous games used multi-floor dungeons up to 32x32 tiles, the dungeons in this game are either single floor, or multiple floors that can fit within a single 32x32 map) In this game, the player can accept "requests" from the non-player characters. These are optional tasks that will reward the player with bonus items, experience or money when finished.</desc>

This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist "swordsman" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.</desc>

		<desc>Players control Tamagon, a green dragon who decides to "attack the Devil's World", along with a red Player 2 version of him. He navigates through a series of mazes and touches Crosses to power up and summon the ability to breathe fire and eat the dots in the maze. Without a cross, he is completely helpless, and cannot complete the maze. The large winged demon simply called "the Devil" dances at the top of the screen, pointing the direction for his minions to move the maze. This can be dangerous, as Tamagon can be squished by getting caught between a maze wall and the moving outer boundary. After the first maze is cleared, the next objective is to get four Bibles, and put them into a seal. The Bibles give Tamagon the same powers as with the Crosses. After carrying them all into the seal, the Devil flies to the next maze. In between, a bonus maze shows up where Tamagon collects six Bonus Boxes under a time limit. The pattern then repeats.</desc>

		<desc>There are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building and John McClane's task is to clear each floor of terrorists and he can then use the stairwell or the express elevator to travel upwards, to a maximum of floors 31-35 (more floors are unlocked in "Advanced" mode). In addition, by shooting at grids in the wall, John is able to climb in the vents, dropping into a designated spot or moving down or up a floor. At the start of the game, the player character can only use a pistol (with 15 bullets) and his fists to dispose of enemies, but later acquires several weapons, such as submachine guns, explosives and flashbangs which the terrorists can also use. When McClane is shot, a few picked up items can drop where he must pick them up again. However, bullets have minimal range, only shooting straight or on a 45 degree angle. McClane's health, which is drained by bullet wounds, can be restored by collecting soda cans from either enemies, snack machines (by shooting several bullets at them) or empty rooms. The player loses the game when all life is lost. The player has about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened, but can gain more time by destroying the main computer on the fifth level. Once all the locks have been opened, the vault is opened and the game's final battle is triggered. The player has only a few minutes to go to the 30th floor, for a final confrontation with Karl, Hans and any of the 40 terrorists left alive. One interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. However, after the second lock is opened, Hans will tell everyone to not use the radio. Also notable is the "foot meter". The meter starts out full, but will eventually decrease if the player character steps on shattered glass or runs around. If the meter becomes empty, McClane will walk much slower than he does when the foot meter is full. It can be restored by collecting med-kits. The game features cinematic sequences which change the story depending on which actions the player takes. For example, if there is fewer than one minute left and the player defeats Karl, the last scene with John and Holly will tell the player the roof has been destroyed by the helicopter sent by Hans.</desc>

		<desc>Doki! Doki! Yūenchi: Crazy Land Daisakusen is a Nintendo Family Computer video game developed by KID and released in 1991 by VAP. Players control a boy with a helmet who kicks balls at enemies in an attempt to save his girlfriend from an unknown force inside an amusement park. The more damage he takes the more damage he does to enemies.

The game was originally called Doki! Doki! Yūenchi (ドキ!ドキ!遊園地?) in Japanese, meaning "Thump! Thump! Amusement Park". Doki (ドキ?) is a Japanese onomatopoeia.

The game was renamed The Trolls in Crazyland for release on the NES by American Softworks. It was previously scheuled to be released as Crazyland, but was then changed to feature the popular Troll dolls. That version was only released in Italy(PAL-A), and Eastern Europe(PAL-B).</desc>

		<name>Dokuganryu Masamune</name>
		<desc>Dokuganryu Masamune (独眼竜政宗?) is a historical simulation game developed and produced by Namco for the Famicom in 1988. It is the third such game to appear on the Famicom inside of a month, including Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition and HOT-B's Takeda Shingen. This game is based on the life of Date Masamune, who held power in Japan during the early Edo period. An outstanding tactician, he was made all the more iconinc for his missing eye, and Date was often called dokuganryu (独眼竜? one-eyed dragon).

In the game, you play as the warring overlord, and your aim is the unification of 11 regions under one rule. While comparable to other historical simulations released around the same time, this game is a little simpler and features immediate battle scenes, a hexagonal map, and includes mini-games such as a gold mine search and horseback archery. The game keeps a light, almost humorous tone, providing updates in the game via the Namcot newspaper, which shows changes in conversation tone and the emotions of your opponents. The difficulty of the game can be set, there are eight commands, and four types of battle forces. This game was only released in Japan, and has never been translated from the original Japanese.</desc>

		<desc>Donkey Kong Jr./Jr. Sansu Lesson was a compilation cartridge released alongside the Sharp C1 TV, a television with a built-in Famicom.

It is a compilation of the games Donkey Kong Jr. and Donkey Kong Jr. Math. The game is not exactly a combination, but rather a "platter" of the two Donkey Kong-related games. Combining half of the 1- and 2-Player game modes from Donkey Kong Jr. and the +-×÷ Exercise mode from Donkey Kong Jr. Math, the game can cater to classic arcade excitement and arithmetic lessons directed towards the younger set. Besides the platter, nothing else seems to have changed.</desc>

		<name>Door Door</name>
		<desc>Door Door's blend of puzzle and platform game elements requires strategy, anticipation, and dexterity. Players control Chun, a small, spherical animal outfitted with a baseball cap. Chun is relentlessly pursued by a quartet of game AI aliens traveling in unique deterministic algorithm paths. The most predictable aliens Namegon and Amechan follow Chun in the most direct path possible, Invekun deviates and follows roundabout paths using ladders, and Otapyon shadows Chun's jumps.

The player's objective is to trap the aliens behind sliding doors positioned throughout each level, courses composed of platforms conjoined by assorted ladders. To trap the aliens, players approach the door from the side its handle is on, open it by running across it, lure the advancing villains inside, and shut the door before they escape. Trapped doors cannot be opened again. Chun can jump to avoid the aliens, whose touch spells death. Bombs and nails, which sometimes appear on the screen, are also lethal. When the player dies (provided he has continues) he restarts the level with previously trapped aliens vanished, and all doors are accessible again.</desc>

		<desc>Doraemon is a video game adaptation of the popular Japanese anime of the same name, developed for the Famicom in 1986 by Hudson Soft. It was the tenth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,150,000 copies in its lifetime. It is the third game created for the Doraemon license after the versions created for the Arcadia 2001 and the Epoch Cassette Vision.

In this game, Doraemon must travel through three different "Worlds" in order to rescue his five human friends who have been kidnapped. Each world is actually a different game with its own style of genre and game play system, and was designed by a different lead designer. The first World is an action game that takes place in a city that scrolls continuously in four directions. The second World is a shooter game that scrolls automatically in both horizontal and vertical directions. The third World is an underwater adventure game where each screen scrolls over to the next like in the original Zelda game.</desc>

		<desc>The general idea of the game is that the player must rescue a POW from a POW camp.

Players can die by being shot, falling into water (by drowning), being blown up by a land mine, and being run over by a tank. Players are in possession of machine gun and can use dynamite as a way to attack the enemies. A strict time limit of 24 hours (five real-time minutes) is used in order to keep the pace of the game relatively brisk. After each round is completed, time is taken off the clock to make things more difficult.

Land mines, trenches, and barbed wire similar to those used in the First World War can be seen throughout the levels. The enemy's naval forces are introduced in the game in the second stage along with bridges to go from island to island while tanks start to make their appearance in the third and fourth stages of the game. Watch towers and enemy barracks make their initial appearance in the fifth stage. Keys are required to complete a level and can be found anywhere in the game; from exploded canisters to enemy barracks.

The author of the original Commodore 64 version is Ken Coates.</desc>

As a young child, Clovis was very mischievous and undisciplined, so his father thought it might be best to place him under the care of a monk who lived in the woods far from the kingdom. Under the monk's care, Clovis began to learn various aspects of knowledge, including how to be a superior swordsman. When word reached the monk that King Lawrence's 16-year-old daughter Celia had been abducted and held by a fearsome dragon, who wished to break the kingdom's spirit and coerce the kingdom to do his bidding, Clovis felt a sense of duty to chase after the dragon and rescue Celia in the name of his father. In order to save his sister, he trained daily with the monk and learned to withstand injury, whether cut by swords or burned by flame, and still be just as capable a fighter as ever.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Fighter</name>
		<desc>The player takes control of a magical human fighter who has the ability to transform himself into a flying dragon. As the fighter, the player can run, crouch, jump, and attack with his sword as he would in most side-scrolling action games. Underneath his life gauge is a "metamorphosis gauge" that will gradually be filled as the player destroys his enemies. When the metamorphosis gauge begins to flash, the player can transform into the dragon by pressing up and A button after jumping. As a dragon, the player will hover in the air while the screen scrolls automatically to the right, similarly to a side-scrolling shoot-'em-up game. The dragon's main attack is his fire breath. While the player can fly in any of the eight directions, they cannot turn around and the dragon will only face and attack to the right. While in dragon, the player's metamorphosis gauge will gradually be drained out. The player will transform back to a fighter if the metamorphosis gauge empties out completely or when the player rapidly taps the A button again.
As the fighter, the player can also shoot a projectile attack by holding the B button until the character begins to flash. The types of projectile fired by the player depends on the color of the player's outfit, which can be changed by picking up certain power-up items labeled with the letters G (green, the player's default color), B (blue), and R (red). Changing the color of the player's outfit will also change the pattern of the dragon's fire breath attack. Other power-ups includes energy restoring potions, a flower that helps fill the metamorphosis gauge faster, and a ring that destroys all on-screen enemies. At the end of each stage, the player will receive a staff that will increase their maximum health.
There are six stages in all, each with their own guardian awaiting to challenge the warrior at the end. The game will end if the player loses all of their life power and only three chances are provided to continue at the stage where they died before the player is forced to start all over.</desc>

		<name>Dragon Scroll: Yomigaerishi Maryuu</name>
		<desc>Dragon Scroll: Yomigaerishi Maryuu (ドラゴンスクロール 甦りし魔竜? lit. Dragon Scroll: Resurrection of the Demon Dragon) is an adventure game developed by Konami in 1987 for the Famicom. It is often compared to The Legend of Zelda in terms of game play, but it is considerably more difficult due to the lack of clues or information on how to proceed.

The game is non-linear, and you must explore different territories in search of the eight stolen magical artifacts that maintain a sleep spell over a large and dangerous dragon. Enemies roam the overworld and dungeons, and must be defeated in order to earn experience points. Experience points are used to increase the player's level, which makes him stronger and gives him access to stronger weapons and magic. Most useful items are well hidden and, even when obtained, are difficult to determine their appropriate use. The game features a password system which allows you to continue play where you left off.</desc>

		<desc>When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an end, it ushered in a new era of sorcery and magic. The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the world from his scourge of evil!</desc>

		<desc>The Kingdom Of Oltaria is a peaceful one, thanks to the power of its Lord King
Akinas. The king's daughter, Princess FAQS, is about to turn 16, but one day an
evil old man known as the Black Master turns up determined to have FAQS for
himself, and he drags her into the world of nightmares: the Black Dream. The
Princes is trapped in a deep sleep, and the king summons adventurers from all
over the kingdom to kill the villain and rescue the Princess. They enter the
Black Dream but never return, at least, never wake up.

One day, Sir Kleith, the Captain of the Royal Guard, decides to go to search
for the Dream Sage in a forest to the south of Oltaria. Eventually, after a
difficult journey, Kleith arrives at his destination, where the Dream Sage is
training a young disciple called GAME to be a Dream Master. (A Dream Master's
role is to bring peace and tranquillity to dreams and their powers must be used
to heal and not to corrupt souls.) Anyway, poor old Kleith dies after
delivering his message about the plight of the Princess.

The Dream Sage says he's too old to undertake the task of saving the Princess
but GAME can do it! This is when the action begins, as GAME falls asleep and
the Black Master appears, to transport him into the first Black Dream where his
skills are put to the test!</desc>

		<desc>500 years ago, the Kingdom of Granville fought a terrible war with Darces the Dark Overlord. A great hero, the warrior "Magi", rose to challenge Darces. He owned six magical swords and a powerful suit of armor that was impervious to all but the most powerful of magic. Five of his six swords were Elemental blades, each created from the rarest metals on earth. The sixth blade, "Tores", used an even more powerful metal. Using his powers, Magi defeated Darces, and exiled him to a far away land. After defeating Darces, Magi grew old and died. Now, on a dark, stormy night in the Kingdom of Granville, Darces the Dark Overlord returns to the land. According to an old saying, "When the shadowed veil returns to mask the midday sun, the Fire of Serpents will rise again; Five shall become the One. The elements now heed his call, and hope is born alive; We will have our peace once more when One becomes the Five."</desc>

		<name>Elysion</name>
		<desc>Elysion, though a fairly traditional 8-bit JRPG in many respects (the first thing the player does is talk to the local King for exposition, for example), draws its influences from a lot of very different games within the RPG family: It superficially resembles the first Dragon Quest, it allows the player to select between multiple protagonists when starting the game as is the case in Final Fantasy, the combat system is real-time combat without screen transitions such as something like Hydlide or Ys and the enemies have an odd habit of only moving when the player does, such is the case in many strategic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.

The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.

"Elysion" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.</desc>

		<desc>Erika to Satoru no Yume Bōken (えりかとさとるの夢冒険? lit. "Erika and Satoru's Dream Adventure") is a 1988 Japan-exclusive adventure video game for the Famicom. It is a fairytale-inspired menu-driven adventure game. Players use the menu commands to interact with the world: moving around, looking around, picking up objects, talking to people, etc. The setting of this game is 20th century Japan.

In a novel twist, the two characters of Erika and Satoru (who are depicted as twin schoolchildren) are independently playable - either a single player switches between the two, or a second player takes over the second twin. Both characters need to be in the same region to converse with NPCs, but are otherwise free to explore the map autonomously. Two-player adventure games are very rare; even in Japan. However, only one person can partake in the animal quiz portion. Failing the quiz will force the player(s) to start from the beginning.

An odd bit of infamy related to this game is a secret developer's message that can be found if the player inputs a list of button presses after waiting some time after the game ends. Inside of which is a litany of compliments and complaints to other co-workers, including some sexual insults which are deeply at odds with the child-friendly nature of the game. It also refers to, among other things, the work Atlus did for LJN including The Karate Kid.</desc>

		<name>Elnark no Zaihou</name>
		<desc>Elnark no Zaihou (エルナークの財宝? lit. Riches of Elnark) is an adventure game developed and published by Towachiki. It presents the action from an overhead perspective, similar to many of the traditional 2D Zelda games.

It is unusual in that it tracks the player's behavior and adjusts a meter which indicates whether the player is generally more good (Light) or more evil (Dark). Though a more evil player has stronger abilities, players must air on the side of good in order to make significant advances through the game.

As a result, this game is considered extremely difficult, due to the unknown nature of how one should behave in order to proceed. If the player does not perform the correct actions, levels typically repeat themselves, and players find themselves stuck in the game with no clear method to advance. In fact, it was one believed that the only way to beat the game was to exploit a bug, however that has since been proven false.</desc>

		<name>Exed Exes</name>
		<desc>On a planet 6000 light-years from earth, there were creatures called Exes, which resemble large insects, that were used for industrial purposes. However, these creatures one day took to revolting against their creators. Two battle machines have been sent to fight against the Exes, known as Colonel and Sargent. The Exes are nearing completion of their secret weapon, Exed Exes, and they must be defeated before this is allowed to happen!

Exed Exes is a basic vertical scrolling shooter; the game scrolls forward, and the player can maneuver their ship around the screen to shoot enemies and avoid attack. POW icons sometimes appear that can power up the ship or turn enemies into fruit that are worth extra points. The game can be played either solo or two-player cooperatively.</desc>

		<desc>Black and White. The battle of opposites... as old as time itself... comes to life in Othello. Its origins are part Western, part Eastern. Othello is fast-paced, as easy to learn as checkers, yet as fascinating as chess. Play against a friend. Or play against the Othello computer in four challenging skill levels. You play the black discs and your opponent plays the white. Trap his discs between two of your own, and his "flip" to your color. One move can change the entire game. Finding that move is the secret to Othello. That's why it takes a minute to learn... but a lifetime to master!</desc>

		<desc>Family Jockey is a horse-racing sim in which the player chooses a horse to ride and wins races to rake in prize money. The races get progressively harder and there are some raising sim aspects to help the horse run faster and make sure their stamina bar lasts longer. There's also a mode where players can gamble on AI races.

Family Jockey was remade a few times on other systems, such as the Game Boy, PC-Engine and, eventually, the Wii.</desc>

		<desc>Family Mahjong II: Shanghai e no Michi is a Mahjong game released only in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom.

Family Mahjong II: Shanghai e no Michi is a Mahjong game and the direct sequel to Family Mahjong. In addition to the standard Mahjong mode, there is a tournament mode with a slight RPG aspect to it, in that the player can enhance certain stats after winning games in order to increase their odds in future rounds of the tournament.

The game is a one-on-one version of the game, less common in real-life Mahjong games but the standard for computer adaptations due to the reduced complexity of having only a single AI opponent. Nihon Bussan was responsible for Family Mahjong II's development and was at the time fairly well known for their Mahjong Arcade games.</desc>

		<desc>Family Quiz 4-nin wa Rival (ファミリークイズ 4人はライバル? lit. Family Quiz 4 Man Rivalry) is a Japanese trivia game devloped by Athena for the Famicom, and published in Japan in November of 1988. This game was Athena's first console release. With a focus on family play, the game allows for four players to compete simultaneously. The goal is to beat the other opponents in four mini-games, each requiring that the player answer some Japanese trivia questions in order to proceed. The four mini-games are based on a game show, a board-game, the game of Othello, and a memory match game. In the game show, the only version that allows for just one player, answering questions correctly raises that player's podium towards a balloon. The other versions require at least two players, and turns may only be taken after players have answered a trivia question correctly.</desc>

		<desc>Family Tennis released December 11, 1987 exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The fourth of Namco's lengthy "Family" series of sports games and the first to concentrate on tennis, Family Tennis plays much like its Nintendo forebear and other tennis game contemporaries. It shares the same viewpoint from behind the court and requires that the player make their way to where each shot is heading and return the ball by tapping the swing button in order to win.

Family Tennis has a few notable quirks, however. First, is that the many fictional tennis players available all superficially resemble actual real-life stars of the sport. The second is "Cosmos Mode", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however. There was also four female characters, of the sixteen total, who all had a bigger racket then the men. Essentially making the women into an 'Easy Mode'</desc>

Jogging Race is the fourth game created by Bandai for the Family Trainer (US: Power Pad) accessory for Famicom systems. It was one of the many games that used the peripheral that did not see a release outside of Japan. As with other Family Trainer games, the emphasis was on receiving a work out using the Famicom, a conceit that would later find greater success with the Nintendo Wii and the Wii Fit games.

Specifically, Jogging Race is about jogging through areas of a simulated Tokyo using the pad to simulate the exercise. The background scrolls by slowly, accurately matching the scale of the distances found in the real location, and will occasionally include additional details like other joggers.

There is also a second mode named Marathon, in which the player competes in a long distance race with other CPU runners.</desc>

		<desc>A Famicom game developed by Bandai as part of their Family Trainer series, which all use the Family Trainer (Power Pad) accessory. The goal is to explore mazes.

The fifth in Bandai's series of Family Trainer games, created for the accessory with the same name (or Power Pad in the US). Unlike the others, which tended to be athletics/exercise games, Meiro Daisakusen ("Epic Maze Battle") is a maze-exploring light RPG where the goal is to walk and jump around mazes to find items and, eventually, the exit.

The game's controls are dictated entirely by the Family Trainer/Power Pad. Different buttons will either cause the protagonist to jump, walk forward, walk backwards, turn left or right or switch their position to the left, right or center of the screen. While searching for the exit, players must be mindful of the various enemies that also inhabit the mazes, most of which must be avoided by jumping over them or running past them.</desc>

Family Trainer: Totsugeki! Fuun Takeshijou is based on the popular TV show Takeshi's Castle, where contestants are pitted against each other in a series of generally absurd physical challenges in order to storm the castle of a character based on Japanese entertainment icon "Beat" Takeshi Kitano.

The game required that the player use the Family Trainer (known as the Power Pad elsewhere) accessory to complete a series of athletics-based challenges to reach the final boss round, which involved driving a small tank around and defeating opponents including Takeshi.</desc>

		<desc>Unlock doors of legend on your journey through Faxanadu!

You are the elves’ last hope. Outside the town walls lurk monsters with the power to destroy anything in their path. Inside the walls, water and time are running out. Soon the ancient elf town of Eolis will vanish into eternity. Only you can save Eolis. No one else dares to venture beyond the walls, onto the World Tree, where towns and fortresses precariously await the whims of fate at the hands of the Evil.

You are searching for the water source and for an antidote to the poison that makes the water undrinkable. To find them you’ll need gold and food and magic, speed with a sword … and luck.

Every town holds a new mystery, every fortress a new danger. Merchants will sell you magic and valuable tools, but it’s up to you to figure out what you need. Long, secret mantras help you slip through the mists, but will you survive the next challenge?

This is Faxanadu, the legend, the adventure – the incredible journey on the World Tree.</desc>

		<name>Ferrari Grand Prix Challenge</name>
		<desc>The Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game is a simplified version that allows players to practice up to six laps or qualify for every Formula One race of the season using metric units (kilometres per hour instead of miles per hour). It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.
Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

		<name>Field Combat</name>
		<desc>Field Combat is a 1985 arcade video game in which the player fights as a single commanding officer in a generic futuristic battlefield. The Family Computer version of Field Combat was later released for the Wii's Virtual Console service exclusively in Japan on June 12, 2007.

The object of the game is to make it all the way to the end of the battlefield using the Genesis; a warship that can fire off missiles. While the player controls the blue forces, the player must defeat the Red forces without dying in the process by either avoiding or shooting helicopters, infantrymen, and tanks. An interesting characteristic of the game is that it is possible to ask for reinforcements from an army, which the player possesses, by pressing both the A and B buttons at the same time. Whenever the player runs out of units to aid him in battle, he can use his special weapon to "absorb" the enemies and add them to his army.

The game used Richard Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries as its background music. There is also an enemy UFO like spaceship that, when in battlefield, attempts to grab and escape with a player friendly unit (if there is any on the battlefield).It will also engage into air-to-air battle with a friendly helicopter (if there is any).</desc>

		<name>Fleet Commander</name>
		<desc>Fleet Commander is a strategy game developed and published by ASCII Entertainment for the Famicom in 1988. It is the first naval battle game ever released for the system. While it supposedly depicts a battle between two fictional countries, the game is largely recognized to be a recreation of one of the crucial naval battles that occurred between Japan and the United States near the end of World War II. Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers.

A couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the "Turbo File," which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.</desc>

Light Warrior Photon Planet Zoldias Battle). It is an adventure game developed for the Famicom by Takara, and published in 1987. The English name of the game has special significance, since "Photon: The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth" is also the name of the first commercial version of a game commonly known today as Laser Tag. However, besides the name, and the fact that you play a character who fires a Photon gun, any further connection between the live action game and this video game is unknown.

In the video game, you play a soldier who must navigate through several different floors of a dungeon which contains items and traps. The player must figure out how to maneuver through the dungeon in an effort to collect various items that will expand his ability to search, and find various disks which contain hints and messages to further aid the player. The game is played from a third-person behind-the-shoulder perspective and contains pseudo-3D visuals. This game was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Galaga</name>
		<desc>The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bombs at the fighter. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost, either by colliding with an enemy or one of its bullets, or by being captured.
Galaga introduces a number of new features over its predecessor, Galaxian. Among these is the ability to fire more than one bullet at a time, a count of the player's "hit/miss ratio" at the end of the game, and a bonus "Challenging Stage" that occurs every few levels, in which a series of enemies fly onto and out of the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. These stages award a large point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy.
Another gameplay feature new to Galaga is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a "boss Galaga" (which takes two shots to kill) periodically attempts to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation. If the player has more lives remaining, play resumes with a new fighter. The captured fighter flies down with the enemy that captured it, firing upon the player just like normal enemies, and can be shot and destroyed. The player can free the fighter by destroying the boss Galaga while in flight, causing the captured fighter to link up with the player's current fighter, doubling his or her firepower but also making a target twice as large.
Galaga has an exploitable bug that can cause the attackers to stop firing bullets at the player, due to a coding error. In addition, similar to the famous "Split-Screen bug" in Pac-Man, a bug exists in Galaga in which the game "rolls over" from Level 255 to Level 0. Depending on the difficulty setting of the machine, this can cause the game to stall, requiring that the machine be reset or power-cycled in order to start a new game.</desc>

		<desc>A Mahjong game based on a manga license, published by Asmik for the NES and MSX in Japan only.

Gambler Jiko Chuushinha is a mahjong gambling game based on a manga with the same name. As such, it has a large cast of characters from the comics that the player can choose to compete against. Beyond the manga license, it is very much still a mahjong game, focusing mostly on playing the tile-based board game, though using a difficult variation on the usual rules of the game.

Gambler Jiko Chuushinha was notable for having several developers working on the project including Bits Lab, Yellow Horn and Game Arts. It would also receive many sequels that play more or less the same, including one for the Sega Saturn (which included anime cutscenes - a first for the license as it was never adapted into an anime).</desc>

It would also receive many sequels that play more or less the same, including one for the Sega Saturn (which included anime cutscenes - a first for the license as it was never adapted into an anime).</desc>

		<desc>A Week of Garfield (ガーフィールドの一週間 Gāfirudo no Isshukan?) is a 1989 Family Computer title based on the comic character Garfield. It was only released in Japan due to issues with using the Garfield license in North America and Europe. It is the third video game to be based on Jim Davis' Garfield Comics

The game is a sidescrolling action game in which enemies can be mice, spiders, birds and other assorted animals. Garfield's default attack is a low judo-style kick when he is standing on his hind feet. There are also several powerups that are limited to how many Garfield has the ability to pick up. A time limit prevents players from wandering aimlessly throughout the level looking for power-ups.</desc>

		<desc>Gegege no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen (ゲゲゲの鬼太郎2 妖怪軍団の挑戦 ? Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Yokai Army) is a RPG game based on a manga and anime from Japan about a boy who is a youkai, a class of spirit-monster to which all of the main characters belong. The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and yōkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.

Gegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.

The map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.</desc>

It is based on Fujiko Fujio A's (the pen name of Motoo Abiko) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime.

The plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he encountered a young 10-year old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while they went on many adventures together. It was aimed at a young audience the same way as the manga and anime it is based on.</desc>

A heavily modified version of Namco's Arcade brawler Genpei Touma Den, known in the west as The Genji and the Heike Clans, Genpei Touma Den: Computer Boardgame is an RPG where the player controls resurrected samurai Tairo no Kagekiyo in his quest for vengeance against the Genji clan.

Kagekiyo travels the country searching for his eternal nemeses all the while fighting youkai and other monsters. These fights are depicted as one-on-one turn-based struggles where the player and creature's health is depicted as candles. Kagekiyo can regenerate health at shrines by spending money and can also level up stats at torii gates by spending "toku", or virtue. Both money and toku are earned defeating enemies.

The game has a physical board game component as well. Included in the box is several miniatures and a fold-out board. Players use the board to move their pieces, but all combat is depicted in-game.</desc>

However, an alien species from the far reaches of outer space began attacking the human forces, putting the very survival of the human race at stake. Though it was only a matter of time before Earth fell to the enormous power of the enemy forces, the Earth's army commander issued an order calling all of the units dispersed around the colonized planets to return to Earth. The player takes the role of a young soldier who was stationed with the Rayieza unit on the planet Mars.

		<desc>When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an end, it ushered in a new era of sorcery and magic. The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the world from his scourge of evil!</desc>

		<name>Gomoku Narabe Renju</name>
		<desc>A board game simulation for the Famicom. The goal is to line up five pieces in a row.

Gomoku Narabe Renju is a video game simulation of a traditional Eastern board game that uses the board and pieces from the popular board game Go. It plays a lot like the American board game Connect Four, in which the goal is to line up a series of five tiles horizontally, vertically or diagonally before the other player can do the same. Two players take it in turns to place a single Go tile on the board, attempting to craft their own lines while strategically placing tiles that blocks the opponent from finishing theirs.

While the normal board game is simply referred to as "Gomoku Narabe" (Five Pieces in a Row, occasionally translated as Gobang), the Renju modifier is an additional rule that makes it harder for the player with the black pieces to win. Because the black player always begins each game (like how the white player always begins each game of Chess), this additional rule is thought to even the playing field. The rule is that the black player will lose if they build a line of six or more pieces: this counts as going "overlong" and counts as a loss.

Gomoku Narabe Renju is the joint-fourth video game ever released on the Famicom, and the joint-first original game produced for the system (the previous three - Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr. and Popeye - were all ports of Arcade games). It was released the same day (August 27th, 1983) as the Famicom version of Mahjong, another board game adaptation.</desc>

		<desc>In the old days, humans and fairies lived together peacefully in a world of light known as Fairyland. At one time, the evil god known as Gala cast a spell on mankind, causing them to forget all about the fairies and cast them out of Fairyland. In the desolate land of the human world, humans toiled and labored and forgot all about the fairies existence.

A thousand years later, human discovered a series caves which contained underground treasure in pyramids. Among the treasures were old documents written by those who had once lived in Fairyland. It is said that if one could rescue three hidden fairies, the connection between the human world and fairyland would be restored. Many adventurers answered the call and set out on a quest to discover the locations of these hidden fairies to be the first to glimpse the world of light after a thousand years.</desc>

A second girl, also in national costume, waves semaphore flags to give the impression that she guides the placement of the tiles.

The player must quickly rotate and place the tiles to catch and conduct a continuously-flowing stream of water from pipes on one side of the shaft to the other. When the player successfully links an inflow pipe on one side of the shaft to an outflow pipe on the other side, a row of tiles disappears, and the player earns points. If the player routes the water to a dead end, the game adds a layer of pipe segments for the player to clear. If the accumulating pipe segments stack to the top of the shaft, the game ends. By clearing the requisite number of rows, the player proceeds to the next game level.</desc>

Because not only are the diamonds hard to find, but you only have 24 hours to find them! What's more, you'll have to think fast and shoot even faster, because ferocious monsters, diving airplanes and hungry man-eating sharks will stop at nothing to prevent you from getting to the diamonds. Think you're a sharp-shooting detective? Well, you better be. Because if you're not, it's curtains for you in this quick-on-the-trigger Nintendo Light Gun game!</desc>

		<name>Gyrodine</name>
		<desc>In the game, the player must pilot the Gyrodyne over vertically scrolling terrain. The controls contain two button, the player has three weapons at his disposal. One button fires a pair of bullet at enemy aircraft. Another button fires twin machine guns down at the ground. If both buttons are pressed, the Gyrodyne launches a missile with limited heat seeking ability. As a result, the player cannot truly fire both guns at the same time. As the player sweeps to the left or to the right, the guns are angle more and more in those directions until the joystick is released or pushed in the opposite direction.

Gyrodine contains gameplay very similar to Xevious and 1942, but without the same intensity. There are no breaks between levels, and there are long periods where no enemies will attack, only to have them swarm your craft a moment later. The arcade game features especially detailed graphics for its time, drawing tiny people, cars, houses and even beach umbrellas with impressive clarity. The appearance of neutral parties plays a crucial role in your score. Destroying unarmed innocent people will result in a stiff penalty being taken from your score.</desc>

At the end of each level, Bugs Bunny had to use his mallet to defeat a Warner Brothers cartoon character such as Foghorn Leghorn, Sylvester, or the Tasmanian Devil. These other Looney Tunes characters are trying to stop Bugs because they are all jealous that Bugs gets all the attention.

		<desc>Remember Tetris? The way those cubes kept coming at you? That was tricky enough, but what if they were half a dozen different hats instead? Derbies, baseball caps, cowboy hats, wizard hats, top hats and crowns? Well, that's the whole idea behind Hatris. The hats keep coming at you two at a time. All you have to do is stack them up five at a time and - poof - they're history. It sounds perfectly simple. Until you get into it. Then you'll wish you had six heads instead of one. Because this is the latest game from Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris, and his partner Vladimir Pokhilko. And anyone who could turn geometry into a contact sport is a force to be reckoned with. And this time they really want you to use your head. If you don't, you'll look pretty strange with that pile of hats on it!</desc>

		<desc>Hebereke (へべれけ?) is a video game series developed by Sunsoft that was released primarily in Japan, with a few releases in Europe and one release in North America. It was one of the company's main franchises during the 1990s. Hebe, the main character of the series, became Sunsoft's main mascot during this period, appearing on the company's logo in several games and commercials. The series features a comical, yet surreal setting and characters. The title of the series comes from a Japanese colloquialism for drunkenness. The series covers several different genres from platforming to puzzle, though they are all set in the same fictional universe.

The first Hebereke game for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released in the PAL region under the title of Ufouria: The Saga, which changed the names of the main characters, while two of them had their looks changed. A North American release was planned, but canceled; however, the PAL region version was later added to the Wii Virtual Console in North America. A later set of games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System were also released under the Hebereke title, which retained the original names and looks from the Japanese version.</desc>

She can defend herself with the use of a large mallet. Running into enemies will make her cry, which causes Kitty to get angry and lose a life. Points in the game are collected as money for the cash register. Allowing the time limit to expire will also cause the player to lose a life. However, there are infinite continues and losing the game score is the only penalty for "game overs." There are 18 stages in the game and the game does not repeat itself after the 18th stage.

		<name>Higemaru Makaijima: Nanatsu no Shima Daibouken</name>
		<desc>Higemaru Makaijima (魔界島 七つの島大冒険 Makaijima Nanatsu no Shima Daibōken?, lit. Hell Island: Great Adventure of 7 Islands) is an action-adventure game developed for the Famicom and MSX home computer, and released by Capcom in 1987. It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed "Makai Island".

In Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications.

Once Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.</desc>

The constant ridicule and persecution caused Gaou to become bitter, and hardened, eventually turning to a life as a thief. In spite of his wicked and corrupt lifestyle, Gaou met a woman who saw goodness in him, and the two were married. However, one day, over nothing more than a trifling disagreement, Gaou lost control of himself, and killed his wife. Realization of what he had done caused Gaou to deeply regret his wicked deeds, and reform his behavior. Gaou encountered a Buddhist monk who helped him change his ways, and discover his passion for sculpting. Renouncing his previous life of violence, Gaou became a Buddhist sculptor, devoting himself to the creation of magnificent sculptures renowned for the raw and powerful emotions he was able to invoke in his work. One day, together with a fellow sculptor Akanemaru, Gaou encountered a mythical phoenix, who, according to legend, can bestow eternal life to those who drink its blood. Inspired, Gaou devotes himself to the creation of a magnificent phoenix sculpture. However, shortly after finishing the sculpture, it was stolen from him, broken into 16 pieces, and hidden in different time periods of the past and the future. In order to recover the 16 phoenix sculpture pieces, Gaou embarked on a perilous journey that would take him through space and time.[1]</desc>

		<name>Hon Shogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden</name>
		<desc>Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden is a Shogi game released for the Nintendo Famicom in 1985.

Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden (Roughly translated: "Book of Japanese Chess: Naito Kudan's Japanese Chess Secret") is a video game biased off of the board game Shoji (Japanese Chess). It was developed and published by SETA Corporation to be released August 10, 1985, exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The game is named for Naito Kunio Kudan, a famous Shoji player from Japan. Born November 15, 1939, Naito has been a professional Shoji player since he was 18 years old. In addition to helping with this video game, Naito Kudan is a published author, having 13 books written about Shoji and running a column in the sports section of the newspaper. He is also a published singer but mostly does it as a hobby. In 2010 Naito was honored with the Order of the Rising Sun, twin Mitsuaki, the fifth highest honor a citizen can receive in Japan.

Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden, follows the standard rules of Shoji (Japanese Chess). There is no ability to change the difficulty or handicap. Most of the screen is the Shoji board, but there is also a representation of the player and computer playing Shoji in a Japanese setting, which moves as the game moves. The player always starts first, with the fastest possible way to beat the computer set at 15 hands/turns.

Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden was entered into the first annual World Computer Shoji Championship in 1990. It was the only NES entrant out of the six entrant, software versus software competition. The game finished in forth place, with a record of two wins and three losses.</desc>

		<name>Hoshi wo Miru Hito</name>
		<desc>Hoshi wo Miru Hito (星をみるひと?, "Stargazers") is a role-playing video game produced and sold exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer in 1987. Published by HOT・B, it is based on their earlier 1984 cyberpunk-themed computer role-playing game Psychic City.

The game is set in a decadent cyberpunk-style future world in which everyone has extrasensory perception. These powers can also be used by the player characters when they confront the various monsters in the game through combat. The eventual target of the game is to defeat the villains. In order to accomplish this, the player's characters must go to the Ark City and eventually to outer space. Unlike the Final Fantasy series, the game does not give the player an automatic "game over" when it is impossible to win the battle. This makes it possible for players to accidentally walk into a walking dead situation every time they are forced to do battle with the game's monsters.</desc>

		<name>Hototogisu</name>
		<desc>A Sengoku-era war simulation game developed by Tamtex for the Famicom in 1988. It was never released outside of Japan.

Hototogisu, which is a common cuckoo in Japan and appears in a lot of its culture, is a war simulation game based in the Warring States era, also known as the Sengoku period. It is also the same historical period in which many other Japanese war simulation games, such as Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition, are set. As with those games, the goal is to balance one's duties as a daimyo - feudal lord - with expanding and increasing one's territories through warfare and diplomacy.

Hototogisu would be followed up many years later in 2008 with Sengoku Efuda Yuugi: Hototogisu Ran for the PSP. It uses the basic structure of its NES forebear but also introduces a collectible card game element to the strategy as well.</desc>

The most obvious game to compare it to is Dig Dug, but without the boulders and with various devices like teleporting doors, speed, dynamite, and a wet suit.

		<name>Toki</name>
		<desc>Toki, known in Japan as JuJu Densetsu (JuJu伝説?) is a 1989 shoot 'em up platformer arcade game, or a "run and gun" developed and published in Japan by TAD Corporation and published in North America by Fabtek. It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as "monkey-spit" or "monkey-vomit" by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

The game is otherwise a fairly traditional 8-bit RPG, though it does feature uncommon aspects such as being able to see enemies while walking around (as opposed to the then-usual random encounters) and a regularly-proportioned adult protagonist. There is also no overworld map - both the towns and monster-infested wilderness are directly connected.</desc>

		<desc>A long long time ago, longer than anyone can remember, evil decended upon the 
good and peaceful people of Fairyland. Old legends tell of a lone brave hero who 
saved Fairyland from the imminent threat of doom. Since then, the people of 
Fairyland have lived through centuries and centuries of peace, and all memories 
of evil faded away.

But one especially dark evening, a huge column of fire exploded out of the 
deepest depths of Fairyland, lighting the night sky. The next morning, strange 
doors began to appear from nowhere. Many who were curious entered these doors, 
but were never seen again.

From that day on, unusual events and catastrophes began to take place. Huge 
cracks opened in the ground, scarring the beautiful lands. Floods wiped out 
entire villages, and the people of Fairyland experienced famine. And then the 
monsters came.

The Fairyland council feared that the same evil in the legends was back again. A 
wise old oracle predicted the second coming of evil. He also spoke of a young 
man who could save Fairyland from its gravest crisis.

A young man was chosen to find the reason and source of the evil. As the people 
gathered to bid him farewell and good luck, they couldn't help but wonder if 
they had chosen the right one.</desc>

Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku ("Go: 9 Row Grid Boardgame") is a Go video game that was originally released for the Famicom Disk System on August 11, 1987 in Japan. It was the first Famicom game developed by Bullet-Proof Software: a development studio operating out of Hawaii that would later be responsible for Nintendo's version of Tetris, among other games. This version of Go is better suited for beginners, as it contains simpler 9x9 grids rather than the regulation 19x19.

Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku has a credit for Edge Computing on its title screen; it is assumed some of the game's coding was taken from Edge's C64 game Micro Go.</desc>

		<desc>Ikinari Musician provides a piano-like keyboard, a treble clef on the staff to show note location, a 5-channel Backing track, 4 timbre choices, and controllers to manipulate common synthesizer parameters such as release and attack, LFO, etc. It also provides recording and play back function.

The player has many choices of styles of the backing track, from popular styles such as Rock, Techno, and Jazz, to various ethnic flavors such as Bossa, Rio, Japan, India, Arabia, etc.

The backing tracks representing the styles use familiar elements to make the game more accessible to the general audience. For example, in the Scotland style Cadence to Arms, a familiar bagpipes tune, is used.

Most backing tracks loop around one or two chords, allowing an open improvisation on the main keyboard. Once the style is chosen, the main keyboard is masked in the way that only the scale that easily fits into the style is available, e.g. blues scale, pentatonic scale, etc.

The keyboard is controlled by the UP-DOWN or LEFT-RIGHT d-pads on the game controller so there is no way to play leaps in the scale.

Due to the hardware limitation, the sound produced is the typical 8-bit chiptune music.</desc>

		<desc>Jarinko Chie: Bakudan Musume no Shiawase Sagashi (じゃりン子チエ ばくだん娘の幸せさがし? lit. Chie the Brat: Bomb daughter finding happiness) is a graphical text-adventure game developed by Konami for the Famicom and published in Japan in 1988. It is a game based on the Jarinko Chie anime and manga about a dependable girl who struggles to help her troublesome father run a small tavern in Osaka. Unbeknownst to her dad, she occasionally visits her mother who left him not too long ago. She plans on trying to reunite them, but not until her father gets a job. The game follows the plotline of several episodes of the anime. Though it is largely text driven, there are moments where the player must play a mini-game in order to advance to the next chapter of the story. Much of the text in the game is presented in traditional Japanese orientation, written top to bottom, and right to left. The game was only released in Japan, and never translated from the original Japanese.</desc>

		<desc>In the year 2061, a manned space mission was planned for Halley’s Comet, which would once again be nearing Earth. A team was assembled from eight countries around the world, and split into two spaceships for the mission, dubbed the “Nebula” and the “Corona.” They would depart from the Space Station Jesus. 

A primary objective of the mission was to collect gas samples from the tail of Halley’s Comet.

		<name>JJ: Tobidase Daisakusen Part II</name>
		<desc>JJ (ジェイ ジェイ Jei Jei?) is an action game developed and published by Square for the Famicom in 1987. In English, it is sometimes referred to by its long form, Jumpin' Jack, or by its subtitle, Tobidase Daisakusen Part II. The game was only released in Japan.

The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets.

JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the "3D mode" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of video game music composition.</desc>

		<name>Jongbou</name>
		<desc>Jongbou is a hybrid Mahjongg/block-breaking game developed by SNK and Micronics and released in Japan only for the Nintendo Famicom.

Jongbou is a combination of the popular Chinese board game Mahjong and a block-breaking game such as Breakout. Players bounce a ball around a Mahjong table filled with concealed tiles, with their goal being to dislodge the tiles and collect the ones they wish to add to their hand by passing underneath them as they fall. The stage is over either after all the tiles have fallen or the player has a winning hand.

The block-breaking aspect is simple: Simply direct the bouncing ball by hitting it with the paddle to first destroy the wall of betting tokens before reaching the hidden tiles. Hitting a tile once reveals it, allowing the player to strategically direct the ball so that they can collect the tile (if desired) and still catch the ball before it leaves the screen.

In addition, there are various power-ups that are mingled with the tiles. These have different characters than the dragons/seasons/flowers and provide different benefits, such as a partial wall to block the ball, forcefields that slow it down and special tiles that reveal all the remaining hidden tiles.

It should be noted that as useful as a tile might be towards obtaining a winning hand, it is not worth losing the ball (and subsequently a life) over.

Mahjong can seem a little convoluted, but it plays essentially like the card game rummy: The goal is to collect and discard tiles until the player has a hand that is comprised of Chows (straights of three, worth nothing but easier to obtain), Pungs (three-of-a-kind) and Kongs (four-of-a-kind, worth more than Pungs). The player normally has thirteen tiles in a hand, though this becomes fourteen tiles when they're in the process of discarding one. If those fourteen tiles comprise of Chows, Pungs and Kongs (and one pair) then it is a winning hand and the holder can declare Mahjong to win the round.

For the purposes of this game, much of the game's rules are unnecessary, including betting or indeed any of the multiplayer aspects. The goal is to simply put together a winning hand by collecting the right tiles as they drop. Tiles can range from "Characters" (a black symbol over a red symbol, actually Chinese numerical symbols for thousands), "Bamboo" (green sticks) and "Wheels" (black and red circles), as well as the three dragons (the red and green characters and the blank white tiles), the four seasons and four flowers. With the exception of the seasons and flowers, players need three (or four) instances of the same tile to score points.</desc>

		<name>Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional</name>
		<desc>A golf sim for the NES developed by HAL Laboratory and released in 1988 in Japan only. It uses the likeness of prolific Japanese professional golfer Masashi "Jumbo" Ozaki.

HAL Laboratory, after creating many of Nintendo's golf games as a second party developer, decided to develop and publish their own golf title. Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi "Jumbo" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'. Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game.

Though by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks.

The game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game's 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes. The player can also adjust the difficulty, which makes wind speed a much more important factor.</desc>

Although it is somewhat obscure and was overlooked due to its late release, it is notable for its long development and as one of the largest RPGs created for the Family Computer.

The game's story opens in the town of Astholm, which is spiritually protected by a sapphire wielded by the priestess Firis. She is one of six priestesses charged with holding a special gem to have together held an archaic power for several generations. During the town's Sapphire Festival, Firis is kidnapped by the henchman of Ezelkiel, a man bent on collecting the priestesses to revive an ancient evil. The player takes on the role of the nameless Hero who, along with being sworn to protect Astholm, is the lover of Firis. He immediately sets out with his army to rescue the priestess and ends up becoming involved in a much larger-scale predicament involving the world's other priestesses and gems.</desc>

Kabushiki Doujou: The Stock Speculation ("Kabushiki" is the Japanese stock market, and "doujou" is, of course, dojo) is a stock trading simulation game, where the aim is to invest wisely in the stock market and develop a bountiful portfolio. The player is given regular money goals to reach before the next target is due and can buy, sell and manage their stocks to achieve as much wealth as possible.

The game uses a lot of public domain classical music, such as the title screen's 8-bit rendition of Bach's Air on a G String.</desc>

		<name>Kaettekita! Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!?</name>
		<desc>A shogi game with a comedic military theme, released by Sofel for the NES in Japan only.

Kaettekita! Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces).

When one of the player's pieces and an opponent's piece occupy the same space, a battle ensues: Some pieces will always win against other types, sort of like the rock-paper-scissors aspect of strategy games like Fire Emblem. If neither of the two pieces are weak to the other, both are eliminated. The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off.

The game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan.</desc>

As the Iga ninja named "Kage," players embark on an action-packed quest as they move toward a magic castle where the Princess "Kiri" is held captive by "Yohshirou Yukikusa." To stay alive, players move vertically and horizontally through forest and castle environments and execute massive jumps, all the while using throwing-star knives and a sword to take down hordes of enemies.</desc>

		<desc>The princess has been kidnapped again, this time by a pair of menacing-looking figures. Locked in a tower, she manages to write a plea for help on a scrap of paper and then sends a paper airplane out of her prison. Miraculously, it reaches her boyfriend Yanchamaru who, being the upstanding samurai that he is, immediately sets out to save her.

Kaiketsu Yanchamaru 3 is the final sequel to Kid Niki and is a significant departure from the first two games. Not only does the game feature full four-way scrolling and large maps to explore, but Yanchamaru himself sports a completely new look and numerous new abilities. His trademark spinning sword now seems to more closely resemble a bō, and Yanchamaru can now use it to shoot waves of energy at foes, bounce on the end, spin in place, and even launch off of walls and corners. Taking a cue from Mega Man, he also now has the ability to slide through narrow spaces and underneath dangerous spikes.

Each stage contains numerous keys and locked doors. Any key will open any door, and it is possible to complete a stage without even finding all the keys and doors. The final door in each stage leads to the boss room. After clearing each stage, your performance is tallied, and depending on what you did, bonuses such as points or lives are given.</desc>

		<desc>Kamen Rider Club: Gekitotsu Shocker Land is an action adventure game developed for the Famicom and published by Bandai in Japan on February 3, 1988. It is based on Bandai's Kamen Rider franchise, a weekly science fiction story created by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori which was published in Shōnen Magazine, as well as being aired on television.

The story takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious terrorist organization. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.</desc>

To further explain, the main character's name is Kantarou, and he throws bombs at his enemies. He is attempting to travel from Kyoto back to Edo (known today as Tokyo) to see his girlfriend Momoko. To get there, he is traveling through the Tokaido highway which is composed of 53 checkpoints along the way. However, an unscrupulous merchant is attempting to capture Kantarou and steal his explosive technique secrets.

Tokaido Gojuusan Tsugi is a horizontally scrolling action game developed by Sunsoft in 1986. It was never released outside of Japan. On June 29, 2001, the game was released for the Windows platform as part of Sunsoft Classic Games 2 along with Ikki (which was itself rereleased as a budget title in 2004).

		<name>Keiba Simulation: Honmei</name>
		<desc>A horse racing simulation game from Nichibutsu, developed for the NES in Japan only.

Keiba Simulation: Honmei ("keiba" is the Japanese word for horse-racing, and "honmei" is a term meaning a favorite to win) is a Famicom horse-racing simulation game from Nichibutsu, often known as Nihon Bussan. In fact, the box art states the former as developer and the title screen states the latter.

As a true simulation game, there is no racing (at least that the player can control) or gambling. The player instead can fiddle with the parameters for each race and the horses competing, changing their stats such as fatigue, age and the weight of the jockey. Then players can watch a race with these settings play out and observe the winner. It is possible the goal of this game is to recreate the likely output of an actual race based on as much information as the player is able to muster in order to assist them with their gambling, though its more likely the game is for racing enthusiasts.</desc>

King of Kings is a fantasy-themed strategy game from Atlus. It plays something like Famicom/Advance Wars or Daisenryaku, where the goal is to quickly conquer locations by producing a lot of units each turn and sending them against enemy forces. As with those games, there is also a little close-up graphic of the two units whenever they meet for battle, which shows how the two sides are faring in the conflict.</desc>

		<name>Koushien</name>
		<desc>A Famicom baseball game based on Japanese highschool baseball. It saw multiple sequels for the Super Famicom.

Koushien is the first game in K Amusement's Koushien series of baseball games that focuses on the highschool level of competition. Koushien refers to the stadium where the final of the national highschool league takes place. It takes a leaf from the book of many other NES/Famicom baseball games, like Namco's Family Stadium, by depicting the batsman at the bottom of the screen and the pitcher at the top. Though it has realistically proportioned athletes, the presentation and idle animations are somewhat comical and the game overall leans on an arcade experience rather than being super realistic.

Koushien was followed by multiple sequels, however the first game was the only one in its series to be released on the original Famicom. Future games would appear on the Super Famicom and PlayStation as well as other, newer consoles. This game would go on to be the basis of SNK's Little League Baseball: Championship Series.</desc>

		<desc>Hi, I am Misako of Nekketsu High. I am the manager of our local soccer team. Finally, we can prove that Nekketsu FC is the greatest team in the world. If we work hard and qualify, the Technos Japan Cup will determine who is the greatest in the world. After Nekketsu FC was formed, I was supposed to lead the team to victory, but I haven't been able to keep my promise. But Kunio is here, and he will guide us to victory. I won't meddle in, but I will offer my advice if you want it. Nekketsu FC, let's go!</desc>

Plus, the traditional baseball stats are not used; rather each player has a set rating for strength and speed, and that is all you get to go by. A neat addition is the power meter, which can help your team get ahead if used properly.</desc>

		<name>Labyrinth</name>
		<desc>Labyrinth was released for the Famicom under its Japanese title, Labyrinth Maou no Meikyuu, which can be loosely translated as Labyrinth: Maze of the Goblin King. It is based on the 1986 film of the same name which was directed by Jim Henson, produced by George Lucas, and featuring David Bowie as Jareth the Goblin King, and Jennifer Connelly as Sarah Williams. Although it was published by Activision, who held the world right publishing rights to video game adaptations of the movie, it is distinctly different from the version of Labyrinth which was developed by Lucasfilm Games (now LucasArts), and published by Activision for the Commodore 64/128, Apple II, and MSX2.

15 year old Sarah is so resentful of her baby brother Toby that she hopes he will just disappear. Her dream becomes reality when goblins kidnap the boy—but Sarah unexpectedly finds herself horrified by the loss. So she sets forth to retrieve him, and finds herself on the adventure of a lifetime. To accomplish her task, she will somehow have to reach the center of the fantastical labyrinth where the wicked Goblin King has imprisoned the lad. But the task is easier said than done, for the maze is filled with strange creatures and mind-bending puzzles that confuse the girl.

While the film was fairly successful in the United States, it developed a rather large following in Japan. Developed Tokuma Shoten created this action-adventure game that was more accurate to the film than the Lucasfilms Games version. The gameplay employed a top-down view similar to The Legend of Zelda, and featured many interesting tricks and puzzles, including levels that played with spatial relationships. Walking through certain avenues found in the levels would seamlessly warp you to another location in the level without any noticeable indication; the surrounding environment of the destination was designed to match the environment of the origin completely. Instead of using a health meter, a running clock displays how much time is remaining, and contact with enemies removes bits of time.</desc>

Constructed at a lagrange point were three huge space colonies: the Isis Cluster (two artificial biospheres, named Land-1 and Land-2, and a satellite). In the year Isis 0024 (55 years after the cluster was constructed), however, a biohazard outbreak occurred on Land-2. All attempts at contact were met with nothing but static.

		<name>Last Armageddon</name>
		<desc>The humans who breathed the toxin-filled air on the Earth's surface became one with the Earth and kept dissolving. The history of humanity ended and dominion of the planet returned to the demons. These mutant creatures did not depend on oxygen to survive. Therefore, they were able to breathe the air and use the land.Meanwhile, an army of robots wage World War IV against the demons in order to conquer what is now known as Makai - the Demon World. These robots came to the planet on a wave of energy that created an explosion that turned the world into a wasteland. Much later in the game, concurrent themes including Adolf Hitler, war, creating a perfect race of people, and the destruction of humanity in the year 1999 are revealed to the player inside one of the robot's main bases.

Can the demons gain dominion on the humans' old planet or will robots enforce impose a millennium of logic and dictatorial force throughout Makai? Playing as the robots is not an option that is open to the player. Therefore, the player must take advantage of his or her mutant army and crush the robot invaders. This game builds on the fear of robot domination of the world that has been featured greatly in movies from The Terminator to Terminator Salvation. The gameplay is similar to Final Fantasy as the turn-based fights are viewed from a third-person perspective.</desc>

You're going to need true grit, and then some, to play it. Because as the Sheriff of Gold Gulch - as tough a Wild West town as there ever was you'll have all you can do to survive 'til sundown. Standing in your way will be all manner of hardcase gunslingers, desperadoes and dry gulchers looking to rob the town bank, run roughshod over innocent townspeople and plant you in Boot Hill. So, like Masterson in Dodge City and Earp in Tombstone, you'll be forced to face one challenge after another threatening both your authority and your life.</desc>

		<name>Layla</name>
		<desc>Layla has to rescue her friend Iris from a genetically modified apparatus named Jill; who is apparently controlled by a Dr. Manitoka. As a member of the CAT Special Forces, Layla has all the skills needed to foil Dr. Manitoka's plans.

Eight different asteroids have to be explored before being able to rescue Layla's best friend.[2] Each asteroid is divided into two sections; the first part involving the surface of the asteroid while the second part deals with the actual enemy base.

There is an equally large mechanical element to the level as there is a biological element. The screen always scrolls from left to right. No backtracking is permitted on any level. While navigating through the cavern-like interiors of the asteroids, enemies must be defeated and password disks must be retrieved. At the final room of each asteroid lies a boss that must be defeated before being able to move on. Several guns in addition to some hand grenades can be used to destroy the bad guys impeding Layla's progress. The handgun is the player's initial weapon; but more powerful weapons can be found just by exploring. Certain blocks can be broken by using the player's chosen weapon; the difference between destroyable blocks and non-destroyable blocks is sometimes indistinguishable.

Bonus levels distributed throughout the game allows players to destroy entire squadrons of enemy ships while being completely impervious to their attacks. Players must be wary that every weapon has a limited amount of bullets; players can possess more than one sub-weapon at a time. When Layla's life reaches zero, she dies and immediately loses a life. A password is shown after the player loses the game. This is done so that players can resume their progress at a later date. The final boss of the game has to be defeated twice in order to end the final stage; both the neck and the body of the enemy must be eliminated.</desc>

		<name>Lot Lot</name>
		<desc>A strategy/puzzle game by Tokuma Shoten Publishing. The goal is to use a pair of arrows to teleport pachinko balls around a maze to the scoring zones, and away from the "Out" zone. It was originally developed for Arcades and ported to MSX and the Famicom.

Lot Lot is a puzzle game involving pachinko balls and has a superficiality similarity to that popular Japanese gambling game. Instead of firing the balls around a table full of pins that change their course, the goal is to make sure the balls run into one of the four troughs that score points, with the higher numbered scoring zones being preferable. If any drop into the "Out" zone, the game is over.

Tokuma Shoten Publishing is a major conglomerate in Japan that mostly publishes magazines, though in the 80s they tried branching out into other mediums as well. Lot Lot is one of their earliest forays into publishing video games, and is the first game of theirs to be published for the NES/Famicom.

The player changes the destination of these balls with a pair of arrows: A pink arrow and a green arrow. Pressing the action button will switch the contents of the two boxes the two arrows are hovering over. The pink arrow goes where the player directs and the green allow follows the same path with a slight time delay. The idea is to pass over the first box that the player wants to teleport balls from and move over to a second box they wish to teleport to, and waiting until the green arrow passes over the original box before pressing the button. The walls of the maze will randomly open and close for limited durations, so the player must send the right balls to the right box quickly in order for them to drain into the scoring zones (or lure them away from draining into the Out zone). The longer the player is able to do this, the more points they will score.</desc>

It was developed by TOSE and released by Namco under their Namcot label on November 6, 1987 in Japan only.

The game is somewhat similar to Namco's earlier released arcade title, Rolling Thunder, with the addition of multiple gadgets and the ability to switch between the three main characters. Lupin and his allies can find other characters in each stage who can be bribed for information. The persistent Zenigata also makes an appearance, present in each stage, attempting to arrest Lupin.</desc>

The game's world includes several towns and cities, two castles, and several dungeons and towers. Unlike many video games, one wins not by defeating a final enemy, but by collecting the necessary items and learning the necessary chants in order to preserve the magic candle. Players begin with one adventurer, a human hero called Lukas. Additional adventurers can be found in the game's two castles. Much of The Magic Candle's fun derives from discovering exactly what is needed to preserve the eponymous candle.</desc>

It seems that the mercenary lost his life, and Doropie sets out to stop the now-free Empress. After the battle, the dying Empress Elysia confesses the reasons behind the invasion and apologizes. The imperial warship explodes shortly thereafter, but not before Doropie escapes it. She is contacted by Kagemaru, who apparently has survived the wounds that Elysia inflicted on him.

Mahjong Taikai ("Mahjong Tournament") is a 1989 Famicom mahjong game from Koei and an unknown developer. It features multiple historical figures as possible CPU opponents, including Masamune Date and Napoleon Bonapart.

As with any mahjong game, the goal is to complete a winning hand before any of the other players can, and the player earns an amount of points dependent on the "strength" of their winning hand. They might also lose points depending on who won and how.

Koei would continue making Mahjong Taikai games for other platforms, including Super Mahjong Taikai for the Super Famicom in 1992.</desc>

		<desc>Adventure game developed by Microcabin in 1986.

Maison Ikkoku, based on the serial manga and anime of the same name, is an adventure game set in a boarding house in the 1980s. The protagonist Yusaku Godai is a struggling student staying at the titular boarding house. When the young widow Kyoko Otonashi arrives as Maison Ikkoku's new manager, Godai is instantly smitten and seeks a way to win her heart. Much of the game's storyline concerns the burgeoning relationship between Godai and Kyoko, and the antics of Maison Ikkoku's other tenants who tend to take advantage of Godai's doormat nature.

The game adaptation was originally released for the PC98-01 and MSX in 1986 before being ported to various other Japanese home computers, including also the Nintendo Famicom in 1988 and the PC Engine (TurboGrafx-16) in 1989. It plays similarly to other Japanese adventure games of the era: the player is given a selection of commands that often changes depending on the player's location, and must determine the correct series of commands necessary to continue the story.</desc>

		<desc>This standard baseball game from Irem has the movie license for Major League, but doesn't actually use it much in-game.

Major League is a 1989 baseball game exclusive to the Japanese Nintendo Famicom based on the North American movie of the same name. While it uses the movie's name and its distinctive "mohawk baseball" mascot, the game does not feature a lot of significant elements from the film.

The game features modes where two human players to compete, one player competes against a CPU opponent, or the player can simply watch two CPU opponents duke it out in the "Watch" mode. The player can also practice their batting with the "Batting" mode, allowing them to get used to the timing.</desc>

		<desc>A stock-trading simulator for the NES that uses the name of famed Japanese financial adviser Matsumoto Tooru. It was developed by Imagineer and was never released outside of Japan.

Matsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku ("Matsumoto Tooru's Stock Success Knowledge") is a stock exchange simulation developed and published by Imagineer. The goal of the game is to make 100 million yen (approximately $1.3mil) in the stock market in the span of a single year via a series of shrewd financial decisions and listening to advice about which way a certain type of stock might turn.

The game is fronted by Matsumoto Tooru, a nationally well-known financial adviser who is often considered to have an expansive knowledge of the Japanese stock market. The game also features the song "The Entertainer" by Scott Joplin.

Though it focused on unusually complex subject matter for a video game, it sold enough copies to inspire a sequel that was released the following year.</desc>

Meiji Ishin ("Meiji Restoration") is an adventure game for the Nintendo Famicom that allows the player to take an active role in one of the most important historical movements in Japanese history: the Meiji Restoration era of the late 19th century, which wrested control of the country from the Shogunate and back to the Emperor.

The first half of the game is spent gathering allies which involves moving from region to region, conversing with leaders and samurai, and occasionally fighting enemies in duels. The second half gives way to a tactical strategy sim similar to Nobunaga's Ambition, as the player's recruited forces march on Edo (Tokyo) to take on the Shogun.</desc>

		<name>Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu</name>
		<desc>A Famicom baseball game developed by Human and published by Bandai. It superficially resembles Namco's Famista series.

Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu ("Meimon! The Third Baseball Club") is a baseball sim for the Famicom that is based on a manga and anime of the same name about an underdog highschool baseball team and the drama that surrounds them. The player can access the game's story mode, which depicts scenes from the manga, by selecting "Dramatic Mode" from the title screen menu. This also adds character portraits to the main game mode.

The game itself is a fairly standard NES baseball game. The pitching/batting perspective is from directly behind the batter, and the player moves the entire group of fielders simultaneously whenever the ball is hit. Graphically, the many super-deformed athletes resemble those of Namco's Famista (the series upon which RBI Baseball was based), which was very much the leading baseball franchise at the time.</desc>

		<desc>Moulin Rouge Senki: Melville no Honoo is a strategy game released in 1989 for the Nintendo Famicom.

Moulin Rouge Senki: Melville no Honoo ("Record of Moulin Rouge War: Melville's Flame") is a strategy war sim with RPG elements for the Famicom. The player controls a party of heroes with an entire army under their control, and fights other armies and random encounters with monsters. To begin the game, the player must purchase and equip their army before setting out.

The game's battles play out in turn-based formations, and each formation acts separately and can target different formations on the enemy's side. For instance, the archers can aim for any of the four rows of enemy forces, though front-line melee fighters are far more limited.</desc>

		<desc>The dragonmen have taken Solace. Its beautiful tree houses lie black and battered amid the stumps of great vallenwood trees. Kapak Draconians, armed with poisoned weapons, enforce a crutal martial law on the survivors.

And Solace is only one outpost: the dragonarmies control the plains. Only the elven kingdom of Qualinesti stands unconquered. The rest of the plainsmen suffer the most: a long slave caravan hauls hundreds of them to the fortress prison of Pax Tharkas.</desc>

But on this mission you better be sly as well, to surprise heavily-armed enemies, busting 'em up quietly and rescuing their hostages before alarms are triggered. Plus you gotta maintain radio contact with Commander South, who'll feed you crucial info on Metal Gear's whereabouts. To survive, capture sub-machine guns, Barettas, grenade launchers, and plastic explosives, until you find and destroy Metal Gear, ending CaTaffy's reign of terror!</desc>

		<desc>Eight years after a great war was waged between colonies in outer space, peace has finally settled back onto the Earth. Tadashi Himukai, a 17-year-old war orphan, purchases a used worker-mech in order to start a construction business with his girlfriend, Elina Furfa. However, when he first activates it, the worker-mech disguise falls away, revealing a combat model Metal Slader, which were all supposedly dismantled after the war, and an enigmatic message is displayed in the cockpit: "EARTH IN PERIL... SEEK THE CREATOR". Prompted by this warning, Tadashi, his sister Azusa, and Elina head out into space to find the answers behind it.</desc>

		<desc>The player must take control of a man known only as Runner, who is given a time limit to run through each of the game's thirty-two rounds while avoiding obstacles and collecting drink cans. The actual running happens automatically: the job of the player is to avoid the obstacles and collect the cans by moving the Runner with the stick and adjusting his speed accordingly.

If the Runner finishes the round within the time limit, the remaining time will be awarded to him as bonus points and he will proceed to the next round. Every fourth round is special, using the remaining time from the three previous ones as additional time. However, if the Runner has not finished the round by the time the time limit runs out, he will be electrocuted and the game will immediately be over.

Obstacles along the way include Slip Zones which will slow the Runner down if he tries to cross over them, Pitfalls which will break under the Runner's weight and drop him into the holes beneath them, and Crackers which will launch the Runner up into the air and cause him to land on his back. Later rounds also feature Jumbo Tires that bounce towards the Runner, Walls that emerge from the ground before receding back into it, Cubes that move through particular columns of tiles, Mice that attempt to jump onto the Runner and slow him down, and Chess Knights and Kings that bounce from one tile to another.

The rounds also feature Springboards, which can be used to propel the Runner forward at a great speed. Some rounds have a special layout of Springboards, where it is possible to use one Springboard to land directly on the second one. Some other rounds also feature Skateboards which will speed the Runner up and make him immune to Slip Zones. There are also two different types of drink cans; kicking them will either gain the player bonus points (from 100 to 5000) or speed the Runner up, but jumping on them will stop the timer for a few seconds.</desc>

		<name>Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachiokun</name>
		<desc>A pachinko simulator for the NES, published by Coconuts Japan. It is the first in a series of pachinko games to feature the Pachio-kun mascot.

The first game to feature Pachio-kun, the mascot for a series of pachinko-themed games by Coconuts Japan, Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachio-kun ("Aiming For Pachinko Pro: Pachio-kun") is simply a virtual pachinko hall with 72 different machines on which the player may try their luck.

The game rewards attentive pachinko veterans by having several of the machines possess quirks, such as the frequency of payouts, certain pins being bent that will favor a ball's route to the bottom and the like. Pachio-kun simply has to lean in to examine the machines closer to ascertain how to make the machine pay out. The overall goal is to keep playing each machine, winning either through a determined strategy or simple perseverance, until all the machines have been emptied of their contents. Doing so will win the game.</desc>

Earwig: same as the scorpion in Centipede, making mushrooms poisonous so that the millipede will charge straight to the bottom of the screen after touching them.
Bee: same as the flea in Centipede, dropping mushrooms in a vertical line and requiring two shots to kill.
Spider: same behavior as in Centipede, bouncing irregularly across the lower portion of the screen. Multiple spiders can appear at the same time on higher levels.
Inchworm: when hit, slows all enemies for a short period of time.
Beetle: crawls around the player area for a while, then climbs up and leaves the screen, turning any mushrooms it touches into indestructible flowers. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls down one row.
Dragonfly: drops mushrooms while zigzagging down, and can be destroyed with a single shot.
Mosquito: bounces off the sides of the screen as it descends. When hit, everything on the screen scrolls up one row.
DDT bomb (stationary): can be blown up with one shot, destroying all enemies and mushrooms within the blast radius. Whenever the mushrooms scroll down, a new bomb is added at the top of the screen. Up to four bombs can be in play at one time.
All flowers and poisoned/partially destroyed mushrooms revert to normal, whole mushrooms when the player loses a life.</desc>

		<desc>Need we say more?
Ultra® Dares you to defy the impossible.  But if you accept, be forewarned.  You and your trio of Impossible Mission Force agents will infiltrate a six level maze of unthinkable danger.  A fortress of international evil designed to sap every ounce of your brains and brawn.  At each turn you must fend off snipers and fire bomb maniacs.  Elude spy cameras and robot sentries.  Escape from countless enemies in hot pursuit.  All in your desperate search for booby-trapped clues, secret ID cards and life-saving switches.
  Any why?  Because the worldwide terrors known as the Sinister Seven have kidnapped Dr. "O," his nuclear military defense system and IMF agent Shannon Reed, and now they threaten to wreak planetary chaos.
  Luckly, your agents are well schooled in the art of espionage and possess their own favored firepower, from rifles to remote control cluster bombs.  But that's no guarantee you'll make it past brutes like Slash Stiletto, Blitz Blizzardski and the Iron Claw.  If by chance you do, there's always the hyper speedboat chases through Venice, hand grenade ski runs down the Swiss Alps, and prison camps in the Pyrenees mountains.
  Remember, should you choose to accept this mission and fail, you, your Nintendo®, and the world will self-destruct in five seconds.</desc>

		<name>Mito Koumon II: Sekai Manyuu Ki</name>
		<desc>A NES action game developed by SunSoft and the sequel to Mito Koumon. It was never released outside of Japan.

Mito Koumon II: Sekai Manyuuki is the sequel to Mito Koumon and is very similar in appearance and gameplay. As in that game, the player controls one of Mitsukini Tokugawa's retainers as they gather clues and evidence of crimes in the area while either avoiding or fighting off hostile NPCs.

Unlike the first game, which was set entirely within Japan, Tokugawa is crossing the world solving issues instead. The first stage is America (specifically the Wild West, as would be chronologically accurate for the 17th century) though there are plenty of other locations to visit across the world as well, including even Transylvania.</desc>

It is based on the anime Mobile Suit Z Gundam, and is one of the first Gundam video games.

Aside from the much later Famicom Mini release, there were two versions of the game: the original release; and a special release of the central location test version, sometimes dubbed Final Version. Only 1000 copies of this second version were ever released, making it among the rarest video games in history.</desc>

		<desc>The third game in TOSE/Jaleco's NES Baseball series and the sixth Moero game overall. Though most of the Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games were released in the US as Bases Loaded, this one was not.

Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (New Burning!! Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) and the third in the series to be associated with baseball. The first two Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games saw localizations in the US as Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded 2, but Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen.

The biggest difference between the previous Moero!! Pro Yakyuu/Bases Loaded games and this one is the slanted perspective for batting and pitching. Instead of the camera being behind the batter or pitcher, the player can see both from an angle, with the two situated diagonally from each other. Likewise, the baseball diamond is shown at an angle making it appear more like a square, with the rest of the field stretching outwards. Despite this new perspective, the game controls similarly to previous Bases Loaded games.

A curious addition is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.</desc>

Momotaro Dentetsu ("Momotaro's Railway") is a train-themed board game featuring the folklore hero of Momotaro, the Peach Boy. It is the first in Hudson's long-running series of the same name. The goal is for each player to drive a train around a board by rolling a die and trying to make as much money as possible, a la board games like Monopoly or the Game of Life.

The game and its series is not to be confused with Momotaro Densetsu, an earlier RPG from Hudson featuring the same characters.</desc>

		<name>The Money Game</name>
		<desc>A Stock Market/life-sim game where the player must manage their stocks in order to achieve a happy life. It was developed by SOFEL for the NES and released in Japan only.

The Money Game is a stock market simulation game where the goal is to raise money through the wise purchasing and selling of various types of stock. Coupled to this is a life-sim aspect where raising a sufficient amount of money at certain checkpoints allows the player to gain and keep a girlfriend, who later becomes their wife and provides children. As well, the player can upgrade from their initial studio apartment to a terraced house to a mansion with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool.

The game is densely packed with Japanese script and requires both literacy in that language and a fairly good understanding of dealing in the stock market itself (though the game does provide tutorials for the latter). It would be followed by a sequel, The Money Game 2: Kabutochou no Kiseki, which in turn would be the basis for SOFEL's Wall Street Kid.</desc>

Coupled to this is a life-sim aspect where raising a sufficient amount of money at certain checkpoints allows the player to gain and keep a girlfriend, who later becomes their wife and provides children. As well, the player can upgrade from their initial studio apartment to a terraced house to a mansion with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool.

The game is densely packed with Japanese script and requires both literacy in that language and a fairly good understanding of dealing in the stock market itself (though the game does provide tutorials for the latter). It would be followed by a sequel, The Money Game 2: Kabutochou no Kiseki, which in turn would be the basis for SOFEL's Wall Street Kid.</desc>

Morita Kazuo no Shogi ("Kazuo Morita's Shogi") is a Shogi game from Random House. The game's namesake, Kazuo Morita, is a famous Japanese Shogi player that had previously been attached to several Shogi games prior to this one. Furthermore, Random House (not to be confused with the famous book publisher) is his development company.

As well as playing regular Shogi against an AI opponent, the player has a few options regarding the set-up of the pieces. There is a mode where they place all the tiles on the board themselves, in case they wish to continue an existing game or maybe replay a famous match at its turning point.</desc>

		<desc>Musashi no Ken - Tadaima Shugyō Chū (六三四の剣 ただいま修行中 lit. "Sword of Musashi - Now in the Middle of Training"?) is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Taito exclusively in Japan. It is based on a Japanese sports manga series written and illustrated by Motoka Murakami that focuses on kendo, simply titled Musashi no Ken. The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode.

The game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up and coming competitors. The anime is broken up in to two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series.</desc>

		<desc>Napoleon Senki (ナポレオン戦記?, "Battles of Napoleon") is a real-time tactics strategy video game developed by Lenar and published by Irem in March 1988 for the Family Computer. In August that same year, Brøderbund announced that it would be released for the North American NES console as The Battlefields of Napoleon; which was eventually cancelled.

This video game allows the player to re-enact the Napoleonic Wars using a bird's-eye view. Starting with earliest battles against the Holy Roman Empire to grab territory for the fledging French Republic during the French Revolutionary Wars in the year 1796, Napoleon would guide the French Revolutionary Wars until they ended in 1802. All the nations that were a participant in the Napoleonic Wars were included like Czarist Russia, Great Britain, and the Spanish Empire. Napoleon's first in-game battle would located in present-day Italy; making the battle equally important in Italian history as it was in French history. There are also battles in what would now considered to be the Arab Republic of Egypt against the Ottoman Empire along with various other conquests in Europe.</desc>

		<name>Ninja JaJaMaru-kun</name>
		<desc>The game stars the brother of Ninja-kun (from Ninja-Kid). Princess Sakura has been kidnapped by Damazu-Dayuu, and because Ninja-Kun is away on a journey, the task falls to young JaJaMaru-kun.

In the game, the player starts with three lives and can only run, jump and throw shurikens. The game is divided into stages, each with four floors and eight enemies. Sakura-Hime and Damazu are placed, unreachable, at the top of the screen. Enemies use various projectiles, one of which will cause the player to lose a life. If JaJaMaru-kun lands on top of an enemy, it will simply be temporarily stunned and vice versa. Once an enemy is defeated and offscreen, a spirit will appear and ascend to the top of the screen. It can be collected before it has disappeared to receive points, which vary depending on the enemy. Sakura will sometimes drop petals that the player can collect, and Damazu will sometimes run around, dropping bombs. To advance to the next stage, the player must defeat all eight enemies by using shurikens.

Some bricks yield items. They include:

    A cart that temporarily makes JaJaMaru-kun invincible and faster. Projectiles and enemies will also be destroyed if touched.
    A bottled substance that makes JaJaMaru temporarily invincible and able to walk through enemies.
    A red ball that increases speed.
    Bombs (which must be avoided).
    Coins that yield various amounts of points.
    An extra life.

If all three types of power-ups are collected, Gamapa-kun, a giant frog, will be summoned, which is completely invincible and able to eat all enemies. If three of Sakura's petals are collected, the player will go to a bonus stage in which JaJaMaru-kun is on the bottom and Damazu at the top. Damazu drops bombs, and the player throws shurikens upward. If the player manages to hit Damazu, bonus points are awarded. If the JaJaMaru-kun is hit by a bomb, he goes on to the next stage.</desc>

		<name>Ninja Hattori-kun: Ninja wa Syugyou de Gozaru</name>
		<desc>Ninja Hattori-kun (忍者ハットリくん?, lit. "Little Ninja Hattori") is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Family Computer exclusively in Japan. It is based on Fujiko Fujio A's (the pen name of Motoo Abiko) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime.

The plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he encountered a young 10-year old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while they went on many adventures together. It was aimed at a young audience the same way as the manga and anime it is based on.</desc>

		<desc>Ninja-kun Ashura no Shou (忍者くん 阿修羅ノ章? lit. Little ninja: fighting demon chapter) is an action game developed by UPL and produced for arcades in 1987. It is the spritual successor to UPL's original Ninjakun. It was released around the world with the title Ninja-Kid II, and in the United States with the title Rad Action.

Ashura no Shou expands upon the basic gameplay introduced in Ninjakun, by introducing new exploration concepts and challenging the player to complete 31 stages of action, with branching levels, larger enemies, and boss battles. The game was ported to the MSX and published by HAL Laboratory. It was also ported to the Famicom in 1988. A US release for the NES was planned under the name Ninja Taro, but ultimately cancelled. The Famicom port was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan in 2009.</desc>

		<name>Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Blue Train Satsujin Jiken</name>
		<desc>Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Blue Train Satsujin Jiken is a mystery game released for the Nintendo Famicom in 1989.

Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Blue Train Satsujin Jiken ("Kyoutarou Nishimura Mystery: Blue Train Murder Case") is the first game in a series of murder mystery adventure games based on novels by famed Japanese mystery author Kyotaro Nishimura. It was developed by TOSE and published by Irem on the Famicom in Japan only. Along with other similarly themed franchises such as Tantei Jinguuji Saburo and Yamamura Misa Suspense, it invites players to solve the mystery by talking to witnesses and suspects and interacting with the environment to discover who is behind the murder.

Kyotaro Nishimura's novels tend to focus on murders that occur on or around trains with this game being no exception. A body is found on a Blue Train - the name given to Japanese cross-country sleeper trains, i.e. those built to accommodate sleeping passengers - and the player character is brought in to solve the mystery.</desc>

		<desc>A block moving puzzle game similar to Sokoban.

Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!? ("Drop Down Puzzle Tonjan?!", sometimes known as simply Tonjan) is a puzzle game from NMK that features anthropomorphic pigs pushing mahjong tiles around in a maze, attempting to push entire stacks down one of the many holes in the area. Bonus points are awarded for pushing certain specified tiles into holes first, and there's one tile in particular that will complete the level once pushed down a hole and is the only compulsory target. Future levels increase the number of tiles and the difficulty, adding fish tiles that cause the player to lose a life if they are pushed down a hole.

Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!? appears to a sequel to NMK's earlier Arcade multiplayer action game Butasan, which features similar looking pigs. The rights to the Arcade version of Tonjan were sold to a Korean company, Dooyong, which turned it into a game named Yam! Yam?! featuring a tanooki wearing an apron.</desc>

Your adventure will take you through ancient Greece on a classic mythological quest. It may be easy to defeat the snakes and centaurs that inhabit most of the cities but how will you defeat Hydra? Or the terrible three-headed dog, Cerberus? You'll need to use all of your adventuring skills to find the magic items that will allow you to rescue your beloved Helene.</desc>

		<desc>Players must play the role of a mother cat called Milky who lives in a dangerous metropolis full of dogs. The dogs want to kill Milky before she can rescue her son Michael who wandered out into the city on his own (and became lost). Players must catch the fish for temporary invincibility. However, the other enemies can still kill the mother cat like the fish merchant (who is the only humanoid bad guy in the game), the automobiles on the road, along with the manholes and the pylons. The city is divided into roads for automobile traffic and sidewalks for roaming pedestrian dogs in overalls. The fish merchants completely replace the dogs after the 30th level; causing the invincibility icon (fish) to become redundant.

Unlike the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series of video games (especially the first NES release which would come out four years later in 1989), open manholes kill the player instead of helping her evade the roaming dogs. Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be "average" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of "dog catches cat; cat catches fish" - emulating the food chain.</desc>

What’s awkward about flying is, if you’re flying Up and want to go Left, you don’t just automatically go Left when you hit the control pad… you go diagonally, then you go left. And you don’t sit still if you let go of the control pad, you have to hit A to stop. And then you have to hit A again to fall to the ground and walk around like normal. Which is all very weird. But you can jump REALLY high, so that’s cool.

There’s a side view, where you can fly, like what I was just talking about, and there’s a top view, where you walk around inside of buildings and stuff. You can’t fly though, but you can jump, which is pretty useless. What’s cool about this game is the sheer amount of fun crazy bonus rooms you can go into. I’ve found the “fly-around-and-break-crates-for-a-while” fun bonus room, and the “jump-around-on-these-tiles-but-they-break-after-you-jump-off-so-you-can-only-jump-on-each-tile-once” fun bonus room. And sometimes at the end of these rooms you can earn neat stuff, like new weapons or weapon upgrades. Sure beats your crappy punch."</desc>

The player and his girlfriend must find their way back home after being sucked into an alternate universe.

A magnificent castle full of 25 different game worlds block their progress, however, and they are filled with enemies on every stage. The player has an overhead view to destroy the enemies for extra loot. Given a strict time limit of 100 seconds to solve each puzzle, the game rewards fast puzzle solvers. The first player controls the male while the second player controls the female. Players only start with three lives and lose them when time runs out or when a monster comes into contact with him/her.

Enemies in the game include springs, rollers, witches, and zombies.</desc>

		<name>Paris-Dakar Rally Special!</name>
		<desc>A NES game based on the famed Paris-Dakar Rally, developed by ISCO. While ostensibly a racing game, the style of gameplay tends to change per level.

Paris-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing.

Developed by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary "kusoge" (crap game).

Stage 1 - Preparation
In the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally.

Stage 2 - First Day
The first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage.

Stage 3 - Second Day
This mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them.

Stage 4 - Third Day
The action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue.

Stage 5 - Fourth Day
As the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks.

Stage 6 - Fifth Day
Into the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts.

Stage 7 - Sixth Day
At some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line.

Stage 8 - Final Day
The Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.</desc>

Returning to our ready-made octopus pot, he reads the "People of the Universe" newspaper and nearly falls off his chopping board in surprise. There now is a picture of the mysterious Great Octopus with the Earth in his arms.
"F...father?," he stutters. It was his father, who had disappeared just two years before never to return home.

The Game Boy version of the game is known as "King of the Zoo" in Europe and "Penguin-kun Wars Vs." in Japan.

The player controls one of five animals (they can choose between cow, rabbit, bat, rat, and penguin) and plays games against all the other animals.n each game, the participating animals find each other on opposite sides of a square table with five balls on each side. The object of the game is to roll those balls over the table. As soon as all ten balls are on one player's side, that player loses the game. Each game also has a time limit of 60 seconds; if that is reached, the player with the fewest balls on their side wins.</desc>

The player controls one of five animals (they can choose between cow, rabbit, bat, rat, and penguin) and plays games against all the other animals.n each game, the participating animals find each other on opposite sides of a square table with five balls on each side. The object of the game is to roll those balls over the table. As soon as all ten balls are on one player's side, that player loses the game. Each game also has a time limit of 60 seconds; if that is reached, the player with the fewest balls on their side wins.</desc>

		<name>Perfect Bowling</name>
		<desc>Perfect Bowling is a Japan-only Famicom bowling game, in which the player competes with other computer opponents. Each of the opponents has their own name, appearance and style of play. The game seems to take place in the future, with lanes restocking pins with lasers and certain characters dressed in strange, futuristic (or at least an 80s interpretation of futuristic) fashions. This is a complete departure from its box art, which seems more reminiscent of the 1950s and 60s.

The game allows for a lot of precision-based options in order to bowl effectively. This includes rotating the ball to put spin on it, selecting the power and hitting the power gauge just right. The player can also select which hand they favor and the weight of the ball during the character creation process.</desc>

		<desc>Don't let the name fool you - Pinball Quest is much more than video pinball. In fact, it's the first-ever multi-screen fantasy in a pinball format! Every move you make tells a story; every shot takes you another step closer in your quest to rescue the captive princess of the castle. Along the way you'll meet ghosts, goblins, witches and demons, in an endless labyrinth of treacherous passages and deadly doorways. It takes a fearless heart and a fast mind to conquer Pinball Quest. It also takes the skills of a true pinball wizard... which you can hone on the three other video pinball games included on this cartridge! So before you pour any more money into your NES library, get the one title that's a library all by itself! No matter how hard you try, you can't get enough of Pinball Quest!</desc>

		<name>Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</name>
		<desc>An adventure game created by Yuji Horii and published by Enix in 1983. Revolving around a murder mystery, the game set the template for the visual novel genre.

Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (The Portopia Serial Murder Case), is an adventure game created by Yuji Horii and published by Enix (now Square Enix). First conceived in 1981, it was released on the NEC PC-6001 in June 1983, and later ported to other personal computers. Chunsoft ported the game to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) on November 29, 1985, and to different mobile phone services starting in 2001.

The game is an investigation adventure, sophisticated for its time, in which the player must resolve a murder mystery by searching for clues, exploring different areas, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles. The game, especially its NES version, was received positively in Japan, where it was an influential title that defined the visual novel genre, in addition to paving the way for the seminal Dragon Quest series of console role-playing games as well as inspiring new game designers such as Hideo Kojima.

It is the first entry in the Yuji Horii Mysteries trilogy. It was followed by Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu!! in 1984 and Karuizawa Yuukai Annai in 1985.

Story:
Kouzou Yamakawa, the president of the Loan and Savings Company, was found dead inside his mansion. A detective and his assistant arrive at the scene for further investigation. The player must resolve the mystery of a murder by searching for clues, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles.</desc>

Most notable of the smattering of minor new additions is allowing the player to choose their venue from four options, ranging from a fully-packed stadium to a park.

		<name>Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken!</name>
		<desc>A comedic adventure game that satirizes the heavy number of baseball and murder mystery games for the Famicom. It was developed and published by Capcom in Japan only.

Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! ("Pro Baseball? Murder Case!") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops.

This game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.</desc>

		<name>The Quest of Ki</name>
		<desc>The Quest of Ki (カイの冒険 Kai no Bōken?) is a 1988 video game developed by Game Studio and published by Namco for the Family Computer. It is the third game in Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower of Druaga.

The story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game.

The game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death.

Ki has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds.

Many of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chest, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found.

After completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the Pac-Man ghosts and the enemies from Dig Dug.</desc>

		<name>Racer Mini Yonku: Japan Cup</name>
		<desc>A board game/racing game hybrid based on a miniature RC car toyline. It was developed and published by Konami exclusively for the Japanese Famicom.

Racer Mini Yonku: Japan Cup ("Yonku" refers to four-wheel drive vehicles) is a board game with racing game sections, in that the player has to construct their own RC 4WD car and then race them against their CPU opponents in various events, often taking terrain handling into account. It was based on the then-popular mini RC car toy fad in Japan. The title screen credits Tamiya, a Japanese toy manufacturer that focuses on model kits and RC vehicles, and their logo frequently appears in-game.

The game was developed by Konami for the Famicom, and was never released outside of Japan.

The player and the CPU opponents take turns moving over a board and acquiring money and parts for their RC car. Money collected can also be spent on new parts. The players' vehicles then race, an automatic process, with the one with the best upgrades usually coming out on top.</desc>

		<desc>The player starts the game as Konami Man and can switch between Konami Man and Konami Lady. If two players are gaming, then one will play as Konami Man and the other as Konami Lady. Both players are not able to switch characters until they rescue at least one character from one of the six levels. The player must play through six different selectable levels that take place in different Konami games. Subsequently the player uses a key to save that game's star character, who then becomes playable. Each character has different abilities to begin with as well as ones they can eventually gain. The player ventures through these first six levels in a sort of non-linear fashion with gameplay very similar to the original Castlevania games. After these stages are completed, the player plays through a scrolling space shooter stage and then a linear final stage.

The player will also regularly visit the lab of Dr. Cinnamon (from the TwinBee series), who will give the player the game's character profiles and refill energy when needed. Through his lab, the player can also talk to Saimon, Dr. Cinnamon's brother, who can resurrect any defeated characters at the cost of 100 bullets per character during the game.</desc>

		<desc>An RPG brawler released for the Family Computer and Super Famicom based on the anime and manga of the same name. Both were developed by TOSE and published by Bandai.

Rokudenashi Blues ("Good-for-Nothing Blues") is a RPG brawler based on the manga of the same name, which also saw two anime movie adaptations close to its release. The player character, Taison Maeda, is a delinquent student who is training to be a professional boxer. He has a reputation as a powerful fighter among delinquent gangs as a result, though despite being violent he has a code of honor.

The Famicom and Super Famicom versions of the game are subtly different due to console differences, but both share their genre, developer and publisher. The Famicom game was released in October 1993, with the Super Famicom version following in April 1994.

Characters from this game have appeared in Jump crossover games, specifically Famicom Jump II and Jump Ultimate Stars.</desc>

Route-16 Turbo takes the concept established in Route 16, and updates the quality of the graphics, but keeps the goal of the game the same. The game play is a near perfect combination of Rally-X and Venture. The player drives a car through several zoomed in blocks collecting bags of money and other items, and travels between blocks along a zoomed out view of the world.</desc>

		<desc>RPG Jinsei Game (ＲＰＧ人生ゲーム?, "RPG Life Game") is a Japan-only role playing game for the Family Computer that is similar to Jinsei Game, which is the Japanese version of The Game of Life.

The object is to explore a city full of stores, places of employment, and learning places. Starting from home, the player must earn money and statistics in order to unlock the better features of the game.

Unlike most games based on the Jinsei Game series, RPG Jinsei Game doesn't use a spinner system. Instead, the controller pad is used for movement and random encounters are featured like in Dragon Quest. The player can also talk to strangers who might either give him/her advice or do something malevolent to him/her. As in the actual Game of Life board game, the player has to choose from a series of careers ranging from a musician to a photographer and even a professional wrestler. Most of these tasks are mundane while one of the quests directly involves chasing down unidentified flying objects. Buildings that are crucial to the quest (other than shops and learning places) can be fully explored; otherwise the player simply talks to the resident.

Fights can occur like in a real role-playing game. However, the players stats are used instead of hit points and magic points.</desc>

		<name>Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu</name>
		<desc>Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu is an RPG based around the anime and manga series known as Saint Seiya. It was developed and published by Bandai in 1987 for the Famicom.

The story of the game draws heavily from the first story arc of the series, from the beginning of the story to the fight with the Gold Saints. The game remains faithful to the original story while introducing some original elements. When the game came out, the story line was in the middle of the Gold Saints story arc. As a result, the last boss of the game is an original character. The actual final fight of the Gold Saints arc was carried over into this game's sequel, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen.

The gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes to transport the character from place to place where he may have to jump over obstacles and fight basic enemies, with a turn based combat system against bosses and other significant battles. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute his power, or Cosmos, to various attributes before each attack. Failure to do so typically results in no damage dealt to the opponent, and a lot of damage received. When Life is lost, the main character can be revived, but if all Cosmos is lost, then the game is over.</desc>

		<desc>Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen  is an RPG based around the anime and manga series known as Saint Seiya. It was developed and published by Bandai in 1988 for the Famicom. It is the sequel to the first Famicom Saint Seiya game, Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu.

As with the original game, the story draws heavily from the first story arc of the series. This version picks up where the original left off, with the Bronze Saints about to take on all twelve of the Gold Saints in order to save Saori before time runs out. The game remains faithful to the original story, to the extent that your options are limited if you try to choose match ups that didn't occur in the show.

The gameplay mixes side scrolling action scenes where a saint must survive long enough to reach a particular Gold Saint's temple, with a turn based combat system against the Gold Saints. In order to be successful at these turn based battles, the player must distribute a pool of Seven Senses to a Saints Life and Cosmos. When Life is lost, certain Saints can be revived under certain conditions, but many are taken out of play. Other Saints and characters become available at particular points along the story.</desc>

		<desc>An RPG published by Kemco for the Famicom. It was never released outside of Japan.

Sanada Juu Yuushi (roughly "Sanada Ten Braves") is a Sengoku era themed RPG featuring ninjas. The Sanada in question is Yukimura Sanada, the second son of one of the more important daimyos (feudal lords) of that era, who is purported to have had ten legendary ninjas helping his war efforts - the same ten braves referred to by the game's title.

The game's general plot has Sanada finding and recruiting the titular ten braves, usually with the caveat that the player helps them with a task before they'll agree to join the party. The menu-driven RPG battles are a little unusual as each is a one-on-one battle with a singular opponent - however, the player is free to choose from any of the characters they've already recruited, changing the character in the subsequent round if they so wish.</desc>

		<name>Sangokushi: Chuugen no Hasha</name>
		<desc>Sangokushi: Chuugen no Hasha is a Strategy game, developed by TOSE and published by Namco, which was released in Japan in 1988.

Sangokushi refers to a novel written about the Three Kingdoms period of China, where the country was temporarily split into three warring states. This is different to the the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, a mostly fictionalized account written some considerable time after the conflict was over and has had many video game adaptations, not least of which being Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms and their later Dynasty Warriors series.

As a war strategy game, the goal for the player and their chosen side is to reclaim all of China under their rule. Players can gather intel, invade other territories or increase their own stats and purchase weapons and supplies for their armies. The game affords the player a certain number of actions per turn before letting the CPU opponents have their turns.

Though this game was created after Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it is in fact the first NES game to be based on the conflict.</desc>

		<name>Sansara Naga</name>
		<desc>Sansara Naga is a role-playing video game that was published by Victor Music Entertainment exclusively to Japan for the Family Computer on the 23rd of March, 1990. A fan-translation was finished and released in 2013 on the 28th of December for Sansara Naga by the hacking and translation group Stardust Crusaders.

Sansara Naga is set in the fantasy-filled lands of India during the Vedic age and also mixes elements of Japanese folklore such as the legend of Brahman Umibouzu ("sea bonze"). Many of the NPCs in game will tell you that Cows are sacred animals and a few will mention the Tower of Ṛta Satya. There is a set of armor in the game called Dharma Armor, which will prevent the player from dealing or being dealt damage.

The story revolves around a Boy/Girl that steals a treasured Ostrich egg from the village of Orissa and decides to reflect upon one's actions; aspiring to become a Dragoon to restore their lost honor. The protagonist will set out on an adventure saving lives, performing good deeds, and raising a newly hatched dragon. There are bosses and many NPC street vendors will attempt to scam you with defective items or attempt to mug you. While the main protagonist does not level and their base stats are fixed at 40 STR, 40 DEF—The dragon that you raise does level. More unique game mechanics to this game include the ability to feed dead bodies to your dragon to raise his level, enchanted armors, field map events, hidden landmarks, a few side quests, and mini-games.

Sansara Naga's gameplay and gameplay mechanics are similar to those of Dragon Quest I, Pokémon and Earthbound.

The Silver Mountains are also referred to as Heaven.</desc>

		<desc>An educational math game for young Japanese students. The first in a series of five games released in 1986 by magazine giant Tokyo Shoseki.

Keisan Game: Sansuu 1 Nen ("Calculation Game: Math Year One") is an educational game for the Nintendo Famicom and intended for the youngest year of Japanese schoolchildren. It includes four mini-games with basic arithmetic problems. In each mini-game, the player simply has to locate the number which completes the sum on the screen in order to proceed. The mini-game themes for this game include: a man catching bird eggs, a rabbit in a field, a man in the mouth of an enormous creature and a car driving down a road.

The game was followed by four games, each offering progressively more difficult math problems. Sansuu 1 Nen was released the same day as Sansuu 2 Nen and Sansuu 3 Nen on the 25th of April, with Sansuu 4 Nen and Sansuu 5+6 Nen released later the same year on October. None of the games were released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/nes/non-english/Satomi Hakkenden (J) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Satomi Hakkenden</name>
		<desc>A Famicom RPG based on a famous Japanese novel series of the same name. It was developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK.

Satomi Hakkenden (usually translated as "The Eight Dog Chronicles") was a long-running 19th century novel series about eight samurais from the Sengoku period and their various adventures. It was in some ways partly inspired by the ancient Chinese epic The Water Margin, which has itself seen video game adaptations in the form of the Suikoden games. Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation. Makai Hakkenden Shada for the Turbografx-16, also released in 1989, would be a later adaptation.

The game itself plays much like Dragon Quest; a common source of inspiration for 8-bit RPGs. The player can walk around towns conversing with NPCs, equipping themselves with weapons and armor and receiving quests and directions to new areas before leaving the safety of the town to fight random encounters on the overworld map that links locations together. Combat follows the tactical turn-based pattern, allowing the player input their characters' desired actions before watching each turn play out. Most of the enemies in the game are based on classical Japanese monsters, usually youkai.</desc>

		<name>Satsui no Kaisou: Soft House Renzoku Satsujin Jiken</name>
		<desc>A murder mystery graphic adventure game for the Famicom. It was never released outside of Japan.

Satsui no Kaisou: Soft House Satsujin Jiken ("Hierarchy Of Murderous Intent: The Software House Serial Murders") is a menu-based adventure game by Hyperware in which the player is a young man attempting to solve the murder of a successful software developer. Like in many Famicom adventure games, the player can gather clues by examining sites of interest, talking to various people and keeping track of the information they've gathered. As the case continues, more people working for the titular game company start dying and the player is given more murders to solve.

Time is an important factor in the game as talking to right people and being in the right places at the right moments will prove instrumental towards solving the mystery. The President of the game company only gives the protagonist three days to solve the case before they get the police involved, giving the player a strict deadline. The game's writer will introduce himself just before the player is asked to identify the culprit, and provide the game's final opportunity to save. The game also has multiple endings, depending on what the player does after the murderer has been identified.</desc>

		<name>Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken!</name>
		<desc>A comedic adventure game that satirizes the heavy number of baseball and murder mystery games for the Famicom. It was developed and published by Capcom in Japan only.

Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! ("Pro Baseball? Murder Case!") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops.

This game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.</desc>

		<desc>The second game in the Famicom series of turn-based strategy games based on the SD Gundam universe.

SD Gundam: Gachapon Senshi 2 - Capsule Senki is the second of five SD Gundam World games for the Famicom, published by Bandai using the Gundam license from Sunrise Studios. As with its predecessor, Scramble Wars, the game is a tactical turn-based war simulation in which each side uses their Gundam mechas to defeat the other and are occasionally aided by a "gachapon" - or capsule machine - that dispenses additional Gundams in a manner similar to their toy counterparts.

The game was the first of the series to be released on a Famicom cart, as Scramble Wars was a Famicom Disk System-only game. Capsule Senki was also rereleased on the Japanese Wii Shop's Virtual Console.</desc>

		<desc>Seikima II Akuma no Gyakushū! (聖飢魔II 悪魔の逆襲！?, lit. "Seikima II The Wrath of Satan!") is a video game that was released in Japan in 1986.

The game is based on a then-popular Japanese heavy metal band formed by Damian Hamada called Seikima-II. This band lasted from its creation in 1982 to its dissolution on December 31, 1999. Their history, as it has been prophesized, is that they are a group of demons preaching a religion in order to propagate Satan through the use of Heavy Metal. Each member is a demon of a different hierarchical class with His Excellency Demon Kogure being leader of demons and His Majesty Damian Hamada being crown prince of hell. In accordance to the prophecy and after completing the world conquest, the band would disband at the end of the century on December 12, 1999 at 23:59:59 Japan Standard Time (09:59:99 Eastern Standard Time).</desc>

		<desc>Seirei Densetsu Lickle (聖鈴伝説リックル, "Holy Bell Legend Lickle"), is a 1992 action platformer video game developed by Takeru and published by Taito Corporation for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Taito released the game at the height of the platformer genre's success, hoping to finally achieve a solid hit on the system with a proven formula, the same way Hudson Soft had done with their Adventure Island series and Capcom with their Mega Man titles.[citation needed] It was notable for having highly detailed graphics for an 8-bit game, seen in the game's menacing boss characters (which contrasted heavily with the more childlike sprites of the protagonists). In recent years, it has developed a reputation of being one of the most rare and expensive video games in history.</desc>

On offense, the player simply receives the ball upon the snap and either attempt to run with the quarterback, toss the ball to one of two running backs, or throw the ball to the one long distance receiver - basically the option offense. On defense, the player chooses one of two players to control, and the computer manipulates the others. The ball can also be punted or a field goal can be attempted.</desc>

		<desc>Sherlock Holmes: Hakushaku Reijou Yuukai Jiken (loosely translated as Sherlock Homes: Kidnapping of the Young Countess) is an adventure game developed for the Famicom by Towachiki, and released in 1986. The game puts the player in the role of Sherlock Holmes, who must travel throughout England (by train) while trying to solve the mystery of a kidnapping. In this unusual portrayal of Holmes, his only means of interrogating anyone to obtain information is by attacking them with jump kicks until they run out of stamina and reveal clues. The game alternates between a zoomed out view of England streets, where every bystander can damage Holmes simply by running in to him, to a zoomed in side scrolling view of buildings or sewers or parks. Besides interrogating people for information, or simply beating them up for train fare, Holmes must search seemingly random cracks or trees in order to find important clues, or inventory items.</desc>

		<name>Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu</name>
		<desc>The third game in TOSE/Jaleco's NES Baseball series and the sixth Moero game overall. Though most of the Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games were released in the US as Bases Loaded, this one was not.

Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (New Burning!! Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) and the third in the series to be associated with baseball. The first two Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games saw localizations in the US as Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded 2, but Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen.

The biggest difference between the previous Moero!! Pro Yakyuu/Bases Loaded games and this one is the slanted perspective for batting and pitching. Instead of the camera being behind the batter or pitcher, the player can see both from an angle, with the two situated diagonally from each other. Likewise, the baseball diamond is shown at an angle making it appear more like a square, with the rest of the field stretching outwards. Despite this new perspective, the game controls similarly to previous Bases Loaded games.

A curious addition is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.</desc>

		<name>Shoukoushi Cedie</name>
		<desc>A NES adventure game based on the anime of the same name, which is an adaptation of Little Lord Fauntleroy.

Shoukoushi Ceddie (sometimes Cedie) is the Japanese title of the 1886 Frances Hodgson Burnett novel Little Lord Fauntleroy, about a down-to-earth kid from New York discovering his heritage as the heir to an Earldom in England, moving to his inherited estate and learning how to become a nobleman. Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master).

The game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions.</desc>

		<desc>You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

A large clock tower, resembling a stone grandfather clock, stands watch over the countryside; an ancient evil was sealed in the clock long ago with a key of time (stored in the middle of its face), and the people have lost their fear.

One day, the clock tower mysteriously stops working. takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key of time in an effort to rewind the clock, a villager drops it. Before they can replace the key, Zouna (a dark wizard who manipulates time) escapes and takes the key.

Zouna wreaks havoc in Marvel Land, darkening and terrorizing its people and laying waste to the countryside. Confident in his power, he builds a castle, ruins once-thriving towns and villages and separates families. Only a few scattered towns remained standing, a futile bastion against Zouna's invasion. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would be subdued heroically by Zouna; Marvel Land needs a savior.

Valkyrie, a fledgling shieldmaiden descends to Marvel Land from the heavens. In her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness which has consumed it, her adventure begins.</desc>

Space Shadow is an on-rails sci-fi Light Gun game from Bandai that takes its inspiration from the claustrophobic killer aliens movie Aliens. The player walks down an octagonal hallway and shoots any hostile extra-terrestrial life that bursts forth from one of the side-passages or the ceiling.

Space Shadow was the pack-in game for the Bandai Hyper Shot, a sub-machine gun shaped Light Gun for the Famicom. Despite the fact that Light Gun games tended to do far better in the US, neither the Hyper Shot nor this game were ever released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<desc>In the old days, humans and fairies lived together peacefully in a world of light known as Fairyland. At one time, the evil god known as Gala cast a spell on mankind, causing them to forget all about the fairies and cast them out of Fairyland. In the desolate land of the human world, humans toiled and labored and forgot all about the fairies existence.

A thousand years later, human discovered a series caves which contained underground treasure in pyramids. Among the treasures were old documents written by those who had once lived in Fairyland. It is said that if one could rescue three hidden fairies, the connection between the human world and fairyland would be restored. Many adventurers answered the call and set out on a quest to discover the locations of these hidden fairies to be the first to glimpse the world of light after a thousand years.</desc>

		<desc>Star Luster (スターラスター Sutā Rasutā?) is a first-person shooter and space combat simulator video game developed and published by Namco in 1985 only in Japan. It is an arcade-style, combat-dedicated, sci-fi flight simulator that was first released for the Family Computer. That same year, Nintendo adapted the title for play in the arcade as part of their Nintendo VS. System.

The game's setting takes place in the UGSF universe, shared by other Namco games like Galaxian, StarBlade, Ace Combat 3, Bounty Hounds, and New Space Order. The game features free-roaming open space exploration, a cockpit view where the cockpit controls could be seen (and where the cockpit bobs up and down), bases where the player can be refueled, a map and radar displaying the locations of enemies and bases, a warp ability that allows the player to be warped to anywhere on the map, and a date system keeping track of the current date which can change when warping long distances. The game also introduced the concept of a regenerating shield mechanic.</desc>

		<name>Stick Hunter: Exciting Ice Hockey</name>
		<desc>Stick Hunter: Exciting Ice Hockey is a game for the Famicom released only in Japan in 1987. It was never released in North America. Stick Hunter was the first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system.

The game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2 players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted.

Playing as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate.

As in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.</desc>

		<desc>The StudyBox, released by Fukutake Publishing Co, Ltd., was much like a tape player for the Famicom. The accessory was small enough to fit on top of the Famicom, to plug into the connector. Also like a tape player, the top of the StudyBox would open to reveal the compartment where tapes were played.

The StudyBox itself did not have the standard Play, Stop, Pause, Fast Forward and Rewind buttons on the system, as would be expected with a tape player. Instead, the student (presumably) would use the Famicom controller and on-screen cues to play the tapes.

We don’t exactly know what the tapes would do. The purpose of the StudyBox was to make the Famicom more educational, giving students the ability to learn about whatever information was contained on the tapes. The tapes were, of course, only sound and voice, without visuals to accompany the studying.</desc>

		<desc>A train-based boardgame for the PC Engine, Famicom, and Game Boy.

Super Momotarou Dentetsu is a train and conveyance-based board game with financial elements that features Hudson's Momotarou character, based on the Japanese folklore hero of the same name. It is the second game in the Momotarou Dentetsu series and the first to be released on a 16-bit console - the PC Engine - hence the "Super" in the title. Several years after its PC Engine release, Super Momotarou Detetsu was also released on the Nintendo Famicom and Game Boy. It received a sequel in Super Momotarou Dentetsu II and a large number of successors.

The goal of the game is to travel the map and acquire territory through business deals, similar to Monopoly or Itadaki Street. Players have to contend with each other for limited resources, as well as CPU threats like the God of Poverty.</desc>

		<name>Super Real Baseball '88</name>
		<desc>Super Real Baseball '88 (スーパーリアル ベースボール '88?) is a baseball game developed by Pax Softonica for the Famicom and published in Japan by Vap in 1988. After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games.

This title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game.

To further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.</desc>

		<desc>It's a reverse bulldog, a double nogin-knocker, a leap off the top turnbuckle - it's pure pandemonium! Welcome to the world of Nintendo Pro Wrestling, where you take on six of the meanest, baddest, most rotten guys around. With names like The Amazon, Giant Panther and Kin Korn Karn. You'll begin the match by choosing a wrestler and an opponent - either the computer or a friend. Then with a flick of the wrist you'll perform drop-kicks, body-slams, head-locks and dozens of other bone-crunching moves designed to annihilate your opponent. But be warned. Each wrestler has his own arsenal of back-breaking moves. Which means you'll have to think fast and move even faster to pin your opponent, hold him for a three-count, and become champion of Nintendo Pro Wrestling!</desc>

		<name>SWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics</name>
		<desc>SWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics is a role-playing game developed by Shouei and published by Toei Animation. This game was only ever released in Japan for the Famicom and was never translated from the original Japanese language.

The player takes control of a five member team of special anti-terrorist agents as they break into a building where a hostage situation is taking place. Their goal is to take out the villains and free the hostages. Battles with gunmen take place in a traditional RPG style turn-based battle. Players enter the commands for each surviving member of the team, including what weapon to attack with, and which target to attack. When not in battle, the player views the building in a traditional 3D dungeon perspective, moving through the hallways, choosing which rooms to investigate, which traps to disarm, and how to proceed to the end of the game within a given time limit.</desc>

		<name>Taito Grand Prix: Eikou heno License</name>
		<desc>Taito Grand Prix: Eikou heno License (タイトーグランプリ 栄光へのライセンス?, "Taito License to Grand Prix Glory"[4]) is a 1987 Formula One racing video game for the Japan-exclusive Famicom. This video game takes the player through randomized street racing circuits in addition to the various circuits of the 1987 Formula One season. There are over fifteen stock car tracks and eight Formula One tracks. Open mode allows the player to practice each course individually without any pressure from anything besides the time limit. Normal mode is more restrictive; the game forces the player to roam from city to city until they end their career by winning a full season of Formula One.

There are three kinds of music (playing from a pretend cassette tape) and a blank soundtrack. The instrumental songs played in the game were: Offside Way, Crushing Light, and Faraway Dream. On the promotional flyer for this video game, a Formula One racing vehicle was shown with the Ford logo shown on the vehicle. However, there are no actual Ford Motor Company vehicles used in the entire game.</desc>

		<desc>A Sengoku period board game simulation starring Beat Takeshi.

Takeshi no Sengoku Fuuunko is a board game simulation starring Japanese comedian-turned-actor "Beat" Takeshi Kitano. Similar to the Game of Life, players move around a board earning money and occasionally encountering events such as a minigame - in which the player can increase their wealth should they succeed - or a penalty. The game has a Sengoku era theme running throughout, from its samurai characters to the tattooed gambler that rolls a dice for determining how many places a player can move around the board that turn.

Beat Takeshi appears frequently while the game is being played dressed in traditional Sengoku era clothing. The game is presumably in reference to the TV show Takeshi's Castle, which also starred Beat Takeshi and had a Sengoku era theme.</desc>

		<desc>Transformers: Convoy no Nazo (translated to Transformers: Mystery of Convoy) is a 2D side-scrolling action platformer developed by ISCO and published by TAKARA for the Nintendo Entertainment System (in Japan only) on Decmber 5, 1986. Set in the first-generation Transformers universe, players control Autobot Ultra Magnus as he storms through various Decepticon strongholds to find the whereabouts of Autobot leader Convoy (known worldwide as Optimus Prime).

Convoy no Nazo consists of nine stages, each ending in a boss battle. Players can move and shoot as well as transform into a more maneuverable vehicle mode. The game is so difficult, most players do not usually pass the first stage. The 9th stage is a maze which, if not completed in precisely the right way, will infinitely loop. Warp Zones can be found by locating Bumblebee in some levels.</desc>

		<desc>Tatakae!! Ramen-Man: Sakuretsu Choujin 102 Gei (闘将！！拉麺男 炸裂超人一〇二芸? lit. Fight!! Ramen-Man: Explosion Superhero 102 Technique) is an adventure game developed by Human Entertainment for the Famicom and published by Bandai in 1988. It is based off the Tatakae!! Ramenman series, which itself is a spin-off of the Kinnikuman series, known in the US as M.U.S.C.L.E.. Ramenman is a popular character in the Kinnikuman universe.

The game follows the eponymous warrior Ramenman as he attempts to track down his father's killers and bring them to justice with his many years of martial arts training. Notably, this game is the first true point-and-click adventure game for the system. While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they are largely driven by menus. Ramenman is directed by using the cursor to select an area to walk to or interact with instead much like classic Sierra adventure games such as King's Quest.</desc>

		<name>Tenka no Goikenban: Mito Koumon</name>
		<desc>An adventure game by SunSoft for the Famicom. The game is based on a TV show about a retired governor and his retainers going around solving problems in Edo period Japan.

Mito Koumon is a long-running Japanese TV show that follows the elderly Tokugawa Mitsukuni, legendary law-maker and former daimyo of the Mito region, and his two retainers Sasaki Sukesaburō and Atsumi Kakunoshin as they enter towns incognito and solve problems regarding political corruption, crime bosses and other problems plaguing the common folk. Only after solving the problem would Tokugawa reveal his identity. He and his retainers would then move on.

The game is an adaptation of the TV show, allowing players to assume the role of one of the retainers as they go around investigating the town. Occasionally this involves fights with corrupt officials, evil samurai and gangsters. There's also a female ghost that will drain the player character's life if it comes into contact with them.

The game is noted for its many instances of speech samples. It also has a considerable amount of text.

Players move around towns from a top-down perspective, going left or right as well as up and down. They can fight other characters on the screen (not all of which are hostile) as well as enter houses and stores to talk to NPCs or purchase items from them. The goal is to hunt down clues to ascertain what problems are plaguing the town, then go fix them.</desc>

In the year 2089, humanity forms an alliance with the intergalactic Baal empire but soon Earth finds out about the alien's true intentions. A group of resistance assembles the project Tetrastar to prepare for the potential upcoming threat. But the project lead by the general Nelson is soon put on hold and a short lived peace settles in. But the whole thing was nothing more than a hostile invasion and the Baal empire finally breaks the alliance and attacks Earth. The player's first mission is to prevent New York to be destroyed and then to retrieve Omega, the faithful robot navigator, to warp to the alien's mother world. The Tetrastar super fighter can move around the screen and fire a standard Vulcan gun. Special weapons become available later in the game from Bombs (WID), Homing Missiles (AAM), Napalm Bombs (NAP) and the powerful Bio Cannon (BIO) - they are accessible via the Select button and triggered by pressing A. They all come in limited quantities and must be refilled by picking up power-pods along the way. Tetrastar features nice stages and cutscenes between them unfold the game's episodic story.</desc>

		<name>Tetris</name>
		<desc>A random sequence of tetrominoes (sometimes called "tetrads" in older versions)—shapes composed of four square blocks each—fall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the "well" or "matrix"). The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.

All of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a "tetris". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called "Easy Spin" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)</desc>

		<desc>A board game simulation similar to Monopoly, but with railroads. Its name means "Railroad Baron". It was only released in Japan, for the Famicom, and has two sequels.

Tetsudou-Oh (occasionally with the subtitle "Famicom Boardgame") is a competitive railroad tycoon-type game where the goal is to own a lot of railroad stations and make a lot of money while bankrupting the other players. Tetsudou-Oh also borrows elements from the Game of Life board game, specifically the lucky/unlucky event that follows every turn and can completely reverse a player's fortunes.

Tetsudou-Oh would be followed by Tetsudou-Oh '96 and Tetsudou-Oh 2, both for the Sony PlayStation. The original game would also see a mobile phone platform remake, named Tetsudou-Oh NEO.</desc>

The game stars Tetsuwan Atom, a popular early anime character who is better known as Astro Boy outside of Japan. Tetsuwan Atom was originally created in 1951 by Osamu Tezuka. The successful series started as a comic strip and was turned into a black and white animated series in 1963. It was one of the first (if not the first) animated TV series produced in Japan, and has influenced countless Japanese animated series that followed. The little robot-boy is one of Japan's most recognizable character. The story takes place in the future, at a time where humans and robots live together in harmony. The powerful robot-boy Atom lives with Professor Ochanomizu, an old scientist who takes good care of the little robot, and helps him fight crime and injustice. One day, burglars break into Professor Ochanomizu's lab and steal all of his money. It is now Atom's duty to recover the stolen loot.</desc>

		<name>TM Network: Live in Power Bowl</name>
		<desc>On New Year's Eve in the year 1999, you lounge around in your room generally doing nothing early in the morning. After turning on your computer, you suddenly acquires information that the strategic defense satellite "Colosseum" has picked up some nuclear weapons being fired.

These nuclear weapons are being fired at a rapid pace between two forces. Without knowing it, World War III is breaking out. All the major cities in the world end up getting catastrophically damaged; including Paris, New York City and Washington, D.C.. A nuclear blast mysteriously sends the player back to December 22, 1989; with only two days remaining until the official launch of the satellite system.

The nuclear war will not be prevented and civilization will destroy itself unless the you can manage to get the TM Network band to a concert for world peace.</desc>

		<name>Toki no Tabibito: Time Stranger</name>
		<desc>An adventure game based on an anime film of the same name, published for the Famicom by Kemco.

Toki no Tabibito "Time Stranger" is an adventure game with a heavy emphasis on text commands and dialogue, similar to other NES adventure games like Portopia Serial Murder Case or Hokkaido Serial Murders: Fade to Okhotsk.

Unlike Portopia and its sequels, there is very little detective work to be done. The player simply visits important people throughout Japanese history as a time-travelling cop, answering their questions and incrementally moving forwards through time towards the present. Most of the game is depicted in a first-person mode where the other person sits across from the main character, who then asks and answers questions. There are a few third-person sequences where the player must get back inside their spaceship-like time machine before it leaves.

While there are a few branching paths depending on dialogue choices taken, the game's narrative is fairly linear.</desc>

Top Racer is a motorcycle racing game from a behind-the-bike perspective. In both these respects, it's a very similar game to Sega's Hang-On series of motorcycle racers. The player can choose from two modes: Grand Prix, in which the player partakes in several consecutive races and Touring, in which the player can choose one of four courses for a single race.

The game is notable for its unusual peripheral: An inflatable motorcycle with a special handlebar controller built-in. The player can sit on the peripheral once fully inflated and use the handlebars to control the on-screen bike.</desc>

		<desc>The Tower of Druaga is a maze-based action role-playing game from Namco, created on the Mappy engine and originally released in Arcades in 1984 and later ported to consoles such as the NES, Game Boy and MSX as well as appearing in numerous Namco compilations, such as Namco Museum Vol. 3 for the PlayStation in 1997. The game is the first in the Babylonian Castle Saga and second chronologically. In 1992, the game was remade for the PC Engine which saw numerous changes detailed below.

Combining hack &amp; slash real-time combat with some basic RPG elements, it laid the foundations for early action role-playing games such as Dragon Slayer and Hydlide. Its hack &amp; slash combat included the ability to both attack with a sword by pressing the attack button and defend with a shield by standing still. It attracted millions of fans in Japan and went on to inspire early action RPGs such as Dragon Slayer, Hydlide, Ys and The Legend of Zelda. The game also debuted the Slime monsters which would later become the mascot of the Dragon Quest series.

The game served the basis of an anime series, The Tower of Druaga: The Aegis of Uruk, from studio Gonzo and was broadcast between April 2008 to March 2009. The anime takes place 60 years after the events of the game. A noteworthy element of the anime is the music, composed by famed video game composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.</desc>

		<name>Tsuppari Wars</name>
		<desc>Tsuppari Wars ( つっぱりウォーズ?, "Delinquent Wars") is an action video game for the Family Computer. The object is to acquire all of the enemies' territory and defeat the evil gang leaders. Even though this game was only released in Japan, the gangsters fight without any weapons and the violence level is mild compared to later gang-related games. Its spiritual descendant is Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas due to its simulation of gang warfare.

Once the main gang leader is defeated in either Tsuppari Wars (ツッパリウォーズ?) or Tsuppari Suku (ツッパリスク?) mode, the remaining members of the gang switch membership to become a gray-colored gang that does not have a leader. Consequently, all territory that belonged to leader that was killed in combat becomes neutral territory with a number describing the strength of the "neutral gangs." These "neutral gangs" will attempt to defend their turf. In order for a gang with colors (red, blue, or green) to use the land as their own, they must eliminate all the gangsters in that territory. However, invasions can be canceled before they can begin by saying "no" when asked to fight (たたかい?, "Struggle").

Neutral gangs, fortunately, do not have ability to invade the territories of the red, blue, or green colored gangs. There are three difficulty levels for computer opponents and games are possible with two or three colors (but never with only one color). After naming the character (using the Japanese alphabet), the player must select his face that will represent his main gang leader. The two gang leaders involved will use a special fighting game engine to settle their differences while individual gang members will fight each other through a special battle screen. The battle screen allows players to use special effects against the opponent like a motorcycle, a thunderstorm, or even a quick call to the police's riot squad. All brawls are timed by a timer which is never seen in the game.

That means if there is no determined winner in a certain number of time, the brawl ends with a stalemate and no territory gains or losses are made. The brawl can be re-initiated either during the player's next turn or during the opponent's turn. There are eight different maps to choose from that depict the world in a manner similar to the board game Risk. There are islands with land bridges and bodies of water to them. Between combat, the player can either move (いどうし?, "Not among") his gang members from territory to territory or immediately end his turn. It is possible for a player to transfer all of his gang members out of a territory, turning it into a blank grey territory without a number.</desc>

		<name>Tsuri Kichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen</name>
		<desc>A fishing sim based on a manga license for the NES. It was developed by Victor Interactive and never released outside of Japan.

Tsurikichi Sanpei: Blue Marlin Hen (lit: "Fishing Maniac Sanpei: Blue Marlin Chapter") is a fishing sim based on a manga and eventual anime named Tsurikichi Sanpei, following the adventures of a preternaturally gifted young fisherman and his travails in various fishing competitions.

The game is centered around one of these fishing competitions, where Sanpei has a limited amount of time to catch the largest blue marlin out of all the competitors. The player must make careful judgements and use their limited time wisely to find and hook the largest marlin they can before the competition ends.

The first game based on the Tsurikichi Sanpei license, Blue Marlin Hen was released on the NES and the MSX around the same time in 1988. Later, there would be a sequel of sorts for the MSX only in 1989 and a PS1 game much later in 2002.

In order to catch anything, the player must choose one of several regions of sea in which to fish. Areas which look promising have large fish icons. Time passes more quickly on this screen, so it's in the player's best interest to find a spot quickly.

Once a sea region has been selected, the player must choose the right kind of bait for hooking billfish and simply sit until they have a bite. At this point, the player must use the gauge above the screen to maneuver themselves and reel the fish on the line. Each fish is judged on its size and play resumes.</desc>

Occasionally, you may find hostages when a building is destroyed; try to rescue as many of the hostages as you can to earn extra points. Your helicopter has the ability to pick up extra weapons. After destroying certain enemies, a power up will be left behind which can give you one of four different types of firepower (the regular machine gun, canon, two way fire, or missiles). Other power ups that can be found include bombs (which can be used to destroy everything on the screen), extra speed, and weapon power up (increases the capabilities of whatever type of weapon you currently have).</desc>

		<name>TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō</name>
		<desc>TwinBee 3: Poko Poko Daimaō (ツインビー３ ポコポコ大魔王 Tsuinbī Surī?, "The Great Demon King Poko Poko") is a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up video game produced by Konami originally released for the Famicom in 1989. It was the third game in the TwinBee series released for the Famicom, following the home version of the original TwinBee and the Famicom-exclusive Moero TwinBee. Unlike Moero, which was released in North America as Stinger, TwinBee 3 was a Japan-only release. It was re-released on April 14, 2006 as part of the i-Revo downloadable game service.

TwinBee 3 ditches the side-scrolling stages from Stinger and only features top-scrolling ones similar to the original. Moreover, the game lacks the 3-Player mode from Moero, allowing only up to two players. The game is considerably easier than its predecessors due to an option mode that allows players to adjust the difficulty and number of ships, as well as the inclusion of the new "soul reviving system", which allows players to recover their power-ups after losing a ship.

The game uses digitized PCM voice samples, particularly when the conga music in one stage chants "Poko Poko", and in the beginning of each stage, in which a voice proclaims the name of the stage.</desc>

Only a photon missile, invented by the extraterrestrials themselves, can destroy this fake planet and bring a halt to this invasion. The earth only has 100 days left to live unless the commander of the Cosmo Carrier can succeed in his duties.</desc>

		<desc>Ultima: Exodus is the first release for the Nintendo Entertainment System of the popular series. Don't expect to able to follow the storylines from the original computer series; this version is completely different and is meant as a stand alone game. At the beginning of the game, you can form your party either from a computer generated randomization or make your own characters if you have the time and talent to do so (there are a TON of different options for characters).

The evil Exodus has risen from the seas to make his new home on a fiery island near Britannia Kingdom. Lord British sends out a plea for the best and greatest warriors known to man to join your group as you set out to defeat this monster. So gather ye weapons and magic spells and take on evils unknown is Ultima: Exodus.</desc>

		<name>Deep Dungeon III: Yuushi heno Tabi</name>
		<desc>Deep Dungeon III: Yūshi he no Tabi (ディープダンジョンIII 勇士への旅?, lit. Deep Dungeon III: The Journey to the Hero) is the third installment in the Deep Dungeon series and the first to be released on the Famicom. This is the first Deep Dungeon title to offer the player a world to explore spanning multiple dungeons and multiple towns. It also allows the player to create their own party with up to three companions in addition to the hero character, with a choice of ranger, magician or priest for each character. Though the player can dismiss a character once the game has started, they will only be able to replace that character if they meet another pre-created playable character in one of the dungeons. However, the game will still end as soon as the protagonist "swordsman" character is defeated. This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies. All other games will force the player to re-enter maps to collect respawning chests for money or items (for resale) if they want to gold farm.</desc>

The game's storyline involves a severe earthquake striking in Tomobiki-cho (the town where the Urusei Yatsura series takes place) and tearing the space-time continuum, forcing Lum to have to travel forward through time in order to be reunited with her "darling" Ataru Moroboshi.

The player starts out at infant school, then works her way to elementary school, junior high school, high school, college, and finally the player gets married to a bridegroom (Ataru) in a white tie outfit. After that, the game starts over again. The game has never been released outside Japan.</desc>

Two five-man teams go for it, each fighting to deliver a three-kilo metallic energy sphere into the opponents goal zone. Teams challenge each other in a surreal arena that utilizes devices such as a warp tunnel, ball launcher, and magnetically charged bounce domes. Klashball features a complete league system. There are 11 rowdy teams, each with unique skills, strengths, and weaknesses. After each match the central computer analyzes the outcome and records the stats. Play against the computer or klash it out with a friend. If you're ready, take a trip into the 23rd century with Klashball. A game so real, it's in your face!</desc>

		<desc>While ostensibly a traditional platform game in which the player controls Kawauso-kun, the game has gained renown for being one of the earliest titles to attempt to break away from the video game conventions of the time. Among other convention-flouting novelties that the game offers are a series of fake title screens that the player must pass through at the start, and the allowance of the main character to traverse the background at times to bypass pits of spikes that otherwise appear impossible to cross.

In addition, the character's attack requires the player to hold down the attack button as the game cycles through the possible special moves with the more powerful attacks only highlighted for a short period of time.</desc>

		<desc>In Marvel Land, people coexist in peace and harmony with nature and the animals are docile. Humans, Sandras, Quarkmen, Tattas and other races mingle, working to improve their community. A large clock tower, resembling a stone grandfather clock, stands watch over the countryside; an ancient evil was sealed in the clock long ago with a key of time (stored in the middle of its face), and the people have lost their fear.

One day, the clock tower mysteriously stops working. takes it upon himself to do just that. Fumbling with the key of time in an effort to rewind the clock, a villager drops it. Before they can replace the key, Zouna (a dark wizard who manipulates time) escapes and takes the key.

Zouna wreaks havoc in Marvel Land, darkening and terrorizing its people and laying waste to the countryside. Confident in his power, he builds a castle, ruins once-thriving towns and villages and separates families. Only a few scattered towns remained standing, a futile bastion against Zouna's invasion. Even Krino Sandra (known as Whirlo in Europe) would be subdued heroically by Zouna; Marvel Land needs a savior.

Valkyrie, a fledgling shieldmaiden descends to Marvel Land from the heavens. In her first adventure, she wields a simple shield and a mace of light. Vowing to save Marvel Land from the darkness which has consumed it, her adventure begins.</desc>

		<desc>The player starts the game as Konami Man and can switch between Konami Man and Konami Lady. If two players are gaming, then one will play as Konami Man and the other as Konami Lady. Both players are not able to switch characters until they rescue at least one character from one of the six levels. The player must play through six different selectable levels that take place in different Konami games. Subsequently the player uses a key to save that game's star character, who then becomes playable. Each character has different abilities to begin with as well as ones they can eventually gain. The player ventures through these first six levels in a sort of non-linear fashion with gameplay very similar to the original Castlevania games. After these stages are completed, the player plays through a scrolling space shooter stage and then a linear final stage.

The player will also regularly visit the lab of Dr. Cinnamon (from the TwinBee series), who will give the player the game's character profiles and refill energy when needed. Through his lab, the player can also talk to Saimon, Dr. Cinnamon's brother, who can resurrect any defeated characters at the cost of 100 bullets per character during the game.</desc>

		<name>Madoola no Tsubasa</name>
		<desc>Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Badham, there was a statue of a bird known as the Wing of Madoola. Whoever possessed the wing would possess the power to rule the world, and many wars were fought between nations to obtain it. A wise king, one of the members of the Rameru family, managed to get a hold of the wing, and ordered that a deep cave be constructed where the wings would be hidden so that the wars would cease. The knowledge of the cave would be recorded and locked away, accessible only to the rulers of the land. Peace soon returned to the world.

Several centuries later, a young member of the Rameru family known as Darutos learned of the location of the wing through the kingdom's secret archives. He betrayed the family and stole away with the Wing of Madoola. Using the power of the wing, he summoned demons to attack and take over castle Arekusu. He constructed an underground labyrinth beneath the castle, built a dangerous fortress, and planned to rule the world.The few survivors of Arekusu's military, and the remainder of the Rameru family fled the castle. They regrouped and devised a desperate plan to overthrow Darutos and regain control of the kingdom. Lucia, a brave warrior, was selected to accompany a member of the Rameru family who was uniquely capable of wielding magic known only to his family.

As they approached Arekusu, they were beset upon by two powerful demons. While one distracted Lucia, the other attacked the Rameru family member. Lucia battled both demons and defeated them, but not before her partner received a fatal wound. Knowing what had to be done, Lucia bravely pressed forward, knowing that only she could stop Darutos, and regain possession of the Wing of Madoola.</desc>

It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1992 Formula One season. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 325 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.
Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

		<name>Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyouto Hana no Misshitsu Satsujin Jiken</name>
		<desc>The second in the Yamamura Misa Suspense series of murder mystery adventure games. It was published by Taito for the Famicom in Japan only.

Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyoto Hana no Misshitsu Satsujin Jiken is the second game based on the work of Japanese mystery novelist Misa Yamamura (the first being Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyouto Ryuu no Tera Satsujin Jiken) and, like the first, concerns a murder in the picturesque Japanese city of Kyoto.

As with the first game, and conversely to other Famicom adventure games around at the time, Hana no Misshitsu Satsujin Jiken has a dynamic bar of commands the player can perform; it changes to reflect what actions are currently possible for the player character in that area, so that they don't waste too much time trying every action in every location to find the next clue. These actions are also represented with symbolic icons, rather than typed out as words.</desc>

		<desc>The first in a series of murder mystery games by Taito penned by and named for Japanese mystery writer Misa Yamamura. The game was released only in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom on December 11, 1987.

Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyoto Ryuu no Tera Satsujin Jiken (roughly "Yamamura Misa Suspense: Murder Case of the Kyoto Buddhist Temple Dragon") is the first in a series of murder mystery games from Taito, based on the work of prolific Japanese mystery writer Yamamura Misa.

Like many of its Famicom crime adventure game peers the goal is to track down a killer using the provided detective skills: examining crime scenes, collecting evidence and talking to suspects and other helpful NPCs.

The game, and its sequels, were never localized or released outside of Japan.</desc>

Yamamura Misa Suspense: Kyouto Zaiteku Satsujin Jiken is the third and final Japanese murder-mystery game in the Yamamura Misa Suspense series of video games developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System by TOSE and published by HectorSoft in 1990. The player takes the role of a detective as they attempt to solve a murder case by travelling across a city, interrogating suspects and witnesses. Gameplay mostly comprises of selecting actions through menus or selecting items shown on screen to interact with similar to many point-and-click adventure games.</desc>

He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning "Monmotaro" (not to be confused with "Momotarō"), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.</desc>

The game advertises itself as a "RPG" on its box art, referring to this additional layer of complexity.

Like The Tower of Druaga, it is considered a historically important game in Japan for the amount of secrets and mysteries it contains and the subsequent difficulty involved in reaching the end without this hidden knowledge. Therefore, it was one of the earliest games for the Famicom to feature its own printed game guide for players to follow. Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.

Though it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named "Team Bioteckers". Galg is their only known video game credit.</desc>

		<name>Perfect Bowling</name>
		<desc>Perfect Bowling is a Japan-only Famicom bowling game, in which the player competes with other computer opponents. Each of the opponents has their own name, appearance and style of play. The game seems to take place in the future, with lanes restocking pins with lasers and certain characters dressed in strange, futuristic (or at least an 80s interpretation of futuristic) fashions. This is a complete departure from its box art, which seems more reminiscent of the 1950s and 60s.

The game allows for a lot of precision-based options in order to bowl effectively. This includes rotating the ball to put spin on it, selecting the power and hitting the power gauge just right. The player can also select which hand they favor and the weight of the ball during the character creation process.</desc>

		<name>Pictionary: The Game of Video Quick Draw</name>
		<desc>The excitement of one of the America's most popular party games comes to the NES with Pictionary. Not only are the elements of the board game there, but so are several picture-based mini-games. Additionally, this version can be played solo, whereas the board game requires at least three people. 

The basic objective of Pictionary is for a person on a team to try and illustrate a word he or she has been given using only drawings. The team must guess what is being illustrated within a certain amount of time. As a reward for guessing the puzzle correctly, the team gets to advance on a board. The team that makes it to the end of the board first wins. 

In addition to the classic drawing aspect to the game, there are also four mini-games to be played in order for a team to win. These include "Attack of the Paint Zombies" (similar to Space Invaders), "The Warehouse Shuffle" (moving crates from one side of a warehouse to another as gremlins try to steal them), "Four Alarm Rescue" (catching people as they jump out of windows), and "Leapin' Energy Casules!" (capturing energy balls to fuel your spaceship). 

There are also other game modes that enable you to use cards you may have for an actual Pictionary board game or a practice mode enabling you to simply draw.</desc>

That's why plundering and pillaging are back in style, as you command the role of a high seas high-jacker. Either an English Buccaneer, Dutch Adventurer, Spanish Renegade or French Explorer, each with a different skill level and strategic impact.
As a swashbuckling scoundrel, you'll barter with enemy merchants, trade for hidden treasure maps, negotiate with unscrupulous governors and forge alliances with monarchs who'd just as soon stab you in the back than float you a loan for new ships. Buth that's only half the battle! You'll also assault towns, sword fight with garrison commanders, lay siege to forts, and fire your cannons broadside at an armada of naval foes, including Spanish War Galleons, Dutch Frigates, French Merchantment and English Sloops.
Arrrrg, me swabby! Don't think it's all fun and destruction. Because if your bloodthirsty crew isn't hept happy boarding and burning enemy vessels, or if your navigation skills leave them shipwreched on a jagged Caribbean reef, they won't think twice about using you for shark bait. Fortunately, if events do take a nasty turn, you can save the statistical foot you've captured and return with a vangeance on another day.</desc>

		<name>Predator</name>
		<desc>Predator is a side-scrolling platformer which uses the imagery and characters from the classic Arnie movie of the same name. The game is not a faithfully conversion of the movie however - your unit has already been killed off when the game starts and you will battle scorpions, enemy soldiers and dodge obstacles etc, before facing the Predator itself a number of times.

The game is a fairly standard run-jump-shoot platformer, except that you start with no weapons at all and must collect them as the game goes on.</desc>

		<desc>The Grand Vizier Jaffar has thrown you into a dark dungeon and plans to marry the girl of your dreams in an hour. You're not going to let that happen are you? Try to escape from the dungeon, take out Jaffar's guards, find your way through the Sultan's palace and defeat Jaffar himself. Now go, you've got 60 minutes!

Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer with run and jump gameplay. Your hero must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple puzzles and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. An especially noteworthy aspect of the game is the very fluent animation of your character.</desc>

Welcome to the world of Nintendo Pro Wrestling, where you take on six of the meanest, baddest, most rotten guys around. With names like The Amazon, Giant Panther and Kin Korn Karn. You'll begin the match by choosing a wrestler and an opponent - either the computer or a friend. Then with a flick of the wrist you'll perform drop-kicks, body-slams, head-locks and dozens of other bone-crunching moves designed to annihilate your opponent. But be warned. Each wrestler has his own arsenal of back-breaking moves. Which means you'll have to think fast and move even faster to pin your opponent, hold him for a three-count, and become champion of Nintendo Pro Wrestling!</desc>

The game would keep track of your speed and endurance and let you know how well you were doing.

		<name>Rampart (Jaleco)</name>
		<desc>A medieval masterpiece of power, strategy and ingenuity! The objective is brutally simple: engage your enemy in an all-out exchange of cannonfire, then assess the damage and rebuild your castle. But the reality of RAMPART is far more complex. The key to victory lies in how quickly you can pick up the pieces and redesign, refortify, and extend your walls before the next battle begins. Whether you're facing an onslaught from the computer's armada, or pitting your castle cannons against another player's, there's only one way out. Defend... or perish.</desc>

However, the destruction of the vehicle will subtract a small amount from the player's fuel tank. In the arcade, Genesis and Lynx versions, players could start the game at a higher rally, with additional opportunities to jump several levels from time to time. Players can continue their game from where they left off, however the player has only one chance to complete the 50th and final rally.

After his stunt plane was wrecked accidentally in a shootout between a couple of thugs and G-Men, the hoods had stashed an amazing stolen device in his cockpit. It didn't take long to figure out it was a rocketpack. And it took even less time for Cliff to become a target for half the city. The hoods wanted the stolen device back. So did its inventor, the famous, but eccentric American industrialist, not to mention the FBI, the U.S. Army, and the most menacing force of all, the Nazis! Even famous film star Neville Sinclair wanted the rocketpack. He had kidnapped Cliff's girlfriend, the gorgeous Jenny Blake, and was offering to exchange her for the device. Cliff had no time to ponder his desperate situation. There was only one course of action; he must become THE ROCKETEER!</desc>

		<name>Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball</name>
		<desc>Join one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history for Roger Clemens' MVP Baseball. While the game does not come with the license of Major League Baseball or the MLBPA, there are still 26 similar teams with rosters resembling those of their actual MLB counterparts, including 1991 statistics. Though player names could not be used, the fictional ones make it apparent who each player represents. For instance, you can strike out one of Oakland's Bash brothers (M. Bash or J. Bash) with Texas' R. Nolan or hit a home run with Detroit's C. Fieldman off of Chicago's M. Gaddox. 

The gameplay of Roger Clemens differs from that of most NES baseball games. Though the batting scenes may resemble those typified by R.B.I. Baseball and Major League Baseball, the view switches to what one might see from the outfield stands once the ball is hit. This results in different controls from most baseball games as well.

A player can challenge a friend or the computer, and one-player games may be exhibition or part of a 33-game season, complete with playoffs once the season is complete. In order to help make your season a successful one, Roger Clemens himself is there to offer advice.</desc>

And so are V.I.P.E.R.'s judo masters, skateboard thugs, motorcycle madmen and other assorted sinister scum. If your multi-faceted fists can't punch you through, you'll need your special assault body blocks, jump kicks and double-whammy slams. It's a bone-crunching skate-athon for your life, Skeeter's life, and for the good of RollerGames. So vanquish V.I.P.E.R. before they melt your ball-bearings into bullets!</desc>

		<name>Scarabeus</name>
		<desc>THE MAZE CRAZY PUZZLE CHALLENGE THAT WILL AMAZE YOU!

Weave your way through the maze of passages which takes you within the ancient tombs and causeways of the Pharaohs. The seeemingly innocent and sturdy-looking floor tiles can move, change, flip and reverse your direction at anytime, throwing you for a serious loop. And, throughout the tangled labyrinth of causeways, there are scarab beetles hiding in the tiles, trying to block your way.
But if you can gain the power of the sun god, "Ra", you just might have the skill and cunning to find your way to the Tomb of the Pharaoh, Scarabeus.
So, if you're ready for the challenge of your life, power up Pyramids of Ra. You'll be amazed.

Scarabeus is prototype of a very simple puzzle game. In it, the player must figure out the best path to draw one line through a series of tiles without any overlap. In fact, to give the player extra incentive not to backtrack, the tiles actually crumble away after use, which leaves no choice but to venture on. Players must cause all of the black tiles to disappear, and then land back on the starting square, with a reward for a quick performance.</desc>

		<desc>In Shockwave you need to retrieve powerful crystals left behind by the Tarian race. The Rastons are after the crystals also, which places a short time limit on the mission. You are armed only with a spacesuit and a shockwave pistol. To retrieve the crystals, you will need to find your way through numerous mazes. Blocks in the maze can be moved with the shockwave pistol. When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.</desc>

		<desc>The aim is to shoot the discs on the screen so that you can acquire enough points to pass the clearing point score of that particular stage without your time or energy running out. You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200. Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.</desc>

Silver Surfer learns that creatures from the Magick Dimension are trying to break through into the universe and their coming will end all life. Vowing to stop them, Silver Surfer must assemble the pieces of a mysterious Cosmic Device and use it to push them back. The pieces of the Device are currently in the hands of some malicious creatures: Reptyl, Mephisto, Skrull Emperor, Possessor and Firelord. Silver Surfer must travel to their domains and defeat them in order to obtain pieces of the device.

Silver Surfer is a shooter game, with some levels taking place vertically and some horizontally. The Surfer's only ability is to move around on the screen and to shoot directly in front of him. Power-ups that can be picked up include: the letter "F" (Firepower) which will increase the number and power of his projectiles, Smart bombs which destroy everything on the screen, the letter "S" (Speedup) which increases the surfer's movement and Orbs which will also fire the Surfer's weapon. Orbs are special in that two can be obtained (only 1 is shown on horizontal scrolling levels) and they can be positioned to fire forwards, backwards or sideways.</desc>

At each level, players will have to kill at least 15 enemies to move on and fight the level's boss. Each one of the six levels can be selected freely right from the start, differing only in difficulty (time limit to beat).</desc>

		<desc>You are the legendary Red Baron, flying a plane through a horizontal side-scrolling scenery set during World War I. To complete a mission, you simply need to get to the landing spot on the other side without being shot down, but you can gain extra points by destroying enemy vehicles and planes. For huge points, pick up a bomb hidden in the level (you will be warned by a sound when approaching it) and drop it on a large structure. If you fail to land on the landing strip, you run out of fuel and crash.

You can only shoot horizontally and diagonally by tilting the plane's nose. When in trouble, perform an aerial loop with the secondary button, this often destroys other planes and avoids bullets. There is a co-op mode with the character Max as well.</desc>

The first part of the game requires the player to activate oxygen and hydrogen pumps as well as get additional crew members into the shuttle within a strict time limit by moving an elevator up and down and avoiding moving bumpers. Then, the player must successfully launch the shuttle into space by performing quick time events that correspond to particular shuttle launch maneuvers such as booster rocket separation. Once in space, one of several missions will be played where the player must control the astronaut by maneuvering him around hazards, replenish his air supply before the timer runs out, and deliver components for the International Space Station to their correct locations. A cosmonaut from the Soviet Union must also be rescued in the game.
Finally, the player must land the shuttle by again performing Quick Time Events that correspond to landing maneuvers before finally landing at Edwards Air Force Base.</desc>

It is an arcade-style, combat-dedicated, sci-fi flight simulator that was first released for the Family Computer. That same year, Nintendo adapted the title for play in the arcade as part of their Nintendo VS. System.

The game's setting takes place in the UGSF universe, shared by other Namco games like Galaxian, StarBlade, Ace Combat 3, Bounty Hounds, and New Space Order. The game features free-roaming open space exploration, a cockpit view where the cockpit controls could be seen (and where the cockpit bobs up and down), bases where the player can be refueled, a map and radar displaying the locations of enemies and bases, a warp ability that allows the player to be warped to anywhere on the map, and a date system keeping track of the current date which can change when warping long distances. The game also introduced the concept of a regenerating shield mechanic.</desc>

		<name>Star Voyager</name>
		<desc>Star Voyager's gameplay requires the player to venture through various sectors of the galaxy in search of different alien fleets so they can be defeated. Fuel stations are placed around sporadically and help if fuel is running low. There are several different planets that are either empty or have people that can upgrade the player's equipment to fight off the enemy fleets. These upgrades include the super laser, improved shields, and engines that enhance the ship's warping ability. Warping is a vital part of the gameplay. If players do not warp to different sectors wisely, they might end up lost, run into dangerous sectors such as the black hole or the asteroid field, or run out of fuel. The game ends if enemy ships destroy the CosmoStation Noah.</desc>

		<desc>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</desc>

		<desc>Super Xevious: GUMP no Nazo (スーパーゼビウス ガンプの謎?) is a video game released for the Family Computer and the Nintendo VS. System.

The only way to progress through the game is to solve challenging riddles in each stage, each one more difficult than the last. Unless the player solves the riddle completely and meets certain criteria, the stage repeats over and over, thus making it harder to complete the game.</desc>

		<desc>Yo! After being treated like garbage by the Ninja Turtles, Shredder has trained a new, more merciless breed of Foot Soldiers to inflict his revenge: A clan of over 700 Taekwondo turtle terminators who have once again captured April O'Neil to use as turtle bait. Fortunately you don't have to face these freaks of torture alone. For the first time ever, two dudes or dudettes can join forces and double-team Shredder, kicking shell while covering each others tails.

But to survive you've gotta fight through 8 action-packed arcade levels, including Vinnie's Valet "Stalking" Lot and the Soho Sewer System, plus two new never-before-seen shell-squashing stages! Each of these deathtraps is reinforced by lethal electro zappers, laser beams, freezer burners or enemies such as Scorpion Robots, Stone Warriors and Baxter Stockman. Shredder has also hired the all-powerful Tora and Shogun, two alien bounty hunters who have never known defeat.

Even though Master Splinter has prepared the turtles well for battle, teaching them radical new attack moves, it doesn't mean this war to save April and turtlekind will be a piece of cake or even a slice of pizza. Because with the forces of revenge on his side and the bounty boys in town, it's payback time for Shredder!</desc>

The main levels of the game consist of side-scrolling jumping and shooting action.

Gameplay consists of moving the protagonist in real-time (day and night) through various terrains, like forests, towns, and dungeons. The player character gathers basic items, like health and magic potions, and increasingly powerful weapons as he completes tasks and advances the plot. Conversations are handled through key phrases.

		<desc>There is a new amusement park in Acme Acres, and everyone has been invited to visit by a "Secret Admirer".
There are five areas which the player can explore, each one starring a different character. Plucky rides a bumper car. Hamton rides a tricky train trip. Babs rides the rollercoaster. Furrball dodges Sweetie as he goes for a wild log ride. And Buster faces the thrills and chills of the Funhouse.
Each ride costs a certain amount of tickets, but as the player racks up points on the various rides, more tickets are earned. Eventually, when enough tickets have been earned, they can be saved until the player has enough to afford the entrance fee to the Funhouse, where Buster Bunny must then navigate numerous obstacles before squaring off with the "Secret Admirer", who turns out to be Montana Max.
Just like in the first game, Roderick Rat is there to try to interfere, plus other villain characters. Other Tiny Toon characters also make appearances in varying degrees.</desc>

You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

		<name>JJ: Tobidase Daisakusen Part II</name>
		<desc>JJ (ジェイ ジェイ Jei Jei?) is an action game developed and published by Square for the Famicom in 1987. In English, it is sometimes referred to by its long form, Jumpin' Jack, or by its subtitle, Tobidase Daisakusen Part II. The game was only released in Japan.

The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets.

JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the "3D mode" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner. The game was scored by Nobuo Uematsu, and is Uematsu's 16th work of video game music composition.</desc>

It features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth (described humorously as "monkey-spit" or "monkey-vomit" by some gamers). The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on you; therefore transforming yourself from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</desc>

		<name>Twin Eagle</name>
		<desc>Twin Eagle is a vertically scrolling arcade style shooter. You control a helicopter, and need to earn points by shooting or bombing the various (and numerous!) enemies you'll encounter. Planes, helicopters, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, foot soldiers, and more will all be trying to bring your mission to an abrupt end! Occasionally, you may find hostages when a building is destroyed; try to rescue as many of the hostages as you can to earn extra points. Your helicopter has the ability to pick up extra weapons. After destroying certain enemies, a power up will be left behind which can give you one of four different types of firepower (the regular machine gun, canon, two way fire, or missiles). Other power ups that can be found include bombs (which can be used to destroy everything on the screen), extra speed, and weapon power up (increases the capabilities of whatever type of weapon you currently have).</desc>

It was the recipient of an extremely positive profile in Nintendo Power — “extremely positive” being NP‘s default setting back in the day — but then vanished, presumably never to be seen again. Last week, though, the archivists at Lost Levels not only acquired the long-lost prototype cartridge, but uploaded a playable version of it to the Internet.</desc>

Lord British, the country's benevolent monarch, has disappeared, and a man named Blackthorn has usurped his throne. The tyrant rules the land by enforcing the virtues upon the will of the people, corrupting their meaning in the process. His fundamentalist visions led him to create a police state, where failure to adhere to the virtues is punishable by death. Behind Blackthorn are the three Shadowlords, anti-thesis to the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. The Avatar must understand their meaning and origins, find a way to defeat them, rescue Lord British, and restore the former ethical principles of Britannia.</desc>

A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player's earnings.</desc>

Your job is to search the city for clues, items and punchlines to jokes which will be your only defense should the Weasels catch up to poor Roger. Except for these Weasels (and birds flying overhead), Roger is more or less invincible as a toon. That means for most of the gameplay, he will be ignored. Should the Weasels appear in an area with you however (with an alarm sounding as they get close), Roger will go bug-eyed and try to run away. It is then up to Eddie to keep the Weasels away from Roger or engage in knock-knock jokes should they happen to catch him.</desc>

The greatest environmental disaster in human history is about to hit your backyard. But you're not backing down, because you're Zen, a cold-blooded Ninja warrior who's come to Earth to clean the clock of Lord Contaminous and his crud-loving cronies.

But wasting these slimeballs won't be easy. Because they'll spew forth the most hazardous graphics ever to wreak havoc on your NES. We're talking horizontal, vertical and 3/4 view scrolling that will give you a whole new perspective on acid rain, oil spills and ozone-ravaging smog. And wait till you see the fluid character movements. They're hotter than a uranium-oozing nuclear meltdown!

There are 12 total levels, each with its own ecological enemies, toxic traps and pollution-fighting objectives. You'll battle oil rig fires, trying to save trapped workers. Use your Photon-Stick to zap gaseous garbage men on a high-speed plutonium mining car ride. Vertical jump through two separate screens to reach a venomous vixen who's single-handedly scorching the rainforests. And spin kick Smogger, a smoked-out scum of the Earth.

Finally, try to survive a rescue mission stage. Rack up points in the bonus recycling level. And slash through 6 subgames that will lead you to the feet of Lord Contaminous, who you must dispose of before he trashes every living thing on the face of the Earth.

For 1 Ninja Master.</desc>

By shooting strange magnetic rays, Darc Seed had turned the helpless nation into zombies and had brought the Statue of Liberty to life to do his dirty work. These rays had also given him control over many deadly weapons, but none were more powerful than the legendary samurai sword, Shura. When the great head of the samurai, Namakubi, heard that the sword had fallen into evil hands, he set off immediately for the United States. For only he possessed the strength and knowledge needed to recapture the magical sword and free the U.S. from the evil clutches of Darc Seed.</desc>

		<path>./Baseball Stars II (U) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Baseball Stars II</name>
		<desc>Baseball Stars 2 is a 2-player baseball arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console.  A less cartoony console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.  Baseball Stars 2 for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.  Changes made from the original Baseball Stars, released by SNK in 1989: Female players are no longer included in any form.  Two additional batting stances. These additional stances are never used for players on custom teams. They will only appear on the pre-made teams' players.  Enhanced pitch control.  Ability to shift field formations when playing defense.  Ability to view your team roster and ratings while in-game.  Sidearm-style pitchers are never generated on custom teams. They can only be hired.  Easier bunting controls; bunts are now retractable. (Hold Down+A to bunt instead of stopping the swing partway through.)  Ability to see lead-offs while pitching/batting.  Six pitchers and four bench players instead of five each.  New music and home run animations. These include the "Power connect" graphic for a two-run home run, an animated graphic of the batter rounding the bases and pumping his fist for a 3-run home run or grand slam, and a similar (yet very rare) graphic including a Yorkshire terrier following the batter for a come-from-behind (usually game-ending) home run in a dramatic situation.  Can no longer name custom teams or rename players on custom teams.  You can still upgrade player using the same 15-point system introduced in the original Baseball Stars. However, the random points you get to disperse to various skills each time you purchase a player upgrade changed from between 1 and 6 to between 1 and 5.  Player upgrades overall are much more expensive while the money received during play has remained about the same. This makes it much more time-consuming to upgrade players to maximum.  You can still fire players and hire players. However, due to the fact you cannot change the names of hired players your hired player will always be named generic names given by the game (examples 'STAR 5', 'ROOK 2', etc.). This can also lead to multiple players sharing the same name throughout the custom teams, even conceivably multiple players on the same team with the same name.  Players can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves. (A peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders. The last pitcher listed on any user-created team in "View Team" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards.)</desc>

There are four video games in the Bases Loaded NES series, Bases Loaded II: Second Season, Bases Loaded 3 and Bases Loaded 4. There was also a Game Boy version of Bases Loaded.

		<desc>Bases Loaded 4 was Jaleco's last 8-bit entry in the long-running baseball series. The game featured slightly more elaborate animations than its predecessor, and much larger fielders. Removed was the goal to play a flawless game; instead the game featured more traditional modes, including exhibition games and full season play.

Geared more toward faced-paced arcade gameplay than simulation, Bases Loaded 4 was not licensed by Major League Baseball or the Major League Baseball Players' Association. Therefore, it did not feature real American (or Japanese, for that matter) teams or players.</desc>

		<desc>A Bomberman named White Bomberman is framed for terrible crimes by Black Bomberman. After being accused of robbing a bank, White Bomberman is thrown in jail. Bomberman's mission is to escape his prison cell and bring Black Bomberman to justice.

The game follows the classic Bomberman formula: you are in a room full of blocks and enemies and Bomberman must plant bombs to destroy the blocks and enemies. Several blocks contain power-ups (such as blast radius increasers or fuse shorteners), and one in each level contains a door, which takes Bomberman to the next level.
Passwords are given after game over, recording the level, number of bombs, and strength of bombs. These passwords can be entered when the game starts allowing the player to continue where he left off.
New to the series are the multi-player modes. Vs Mode is a 2-player mode, while Battle Mode is a 3-player mode. The objective is to kill the opposing Bomberman by planting bombs. An NES Four Score is required to play the 3-player mode.</desc>

		<path>./Dragon Warrior III (U) [!].zip</path>
		<name>Dragon Warrior III</name>
		<desc>Dragon Warrior III is noted for greatly expanding upon the original Dragon Warrior and Dragon Warrior II. The game uses basic console role-playing game conventions, such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. Battle is turn-based like the other games in the series.
Dragon Warrior III features a class system, in which each character has a certain class. While the Hero always keeps the Hero class, the other characters can choose among the following: Soldier (Warrior in the GBC version), Fighter, Pilgrim (Cleric), Wizard (Mage), Merchant (Dealer), Goof-Off (Jester), Sage, and Thief which was available only in the later versions. The choice of class greatly affects the character's stats and spells he or she can learn. Furthermore, upon reaching experience Level 20, a character has the option of changing classes at the temple of Dhama, found halfway through the game. The game starts with just the Hero in the party, who then is able to recruit a party of three at the local tavern. Unlike most Dragon Quest parties, aside from the Hero, the party is not made up of characters involved in the story. Although only four characters can be in the party at a time, extra members of the party can be kept at the tavern, allowing room for new recruits. Another innovation is an arena where the player can place bets on the outcome of monster battles.
The remakes incorporated some interface changes from later games in the series, such as simplified door opening; the bag, which replaced bank item storage; the item sorting "Tidy Item" and "Tidy Bag" commands; and the "Full HP" command, which can be used outside of combat to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells.
While the earlier Dragon Quest games were also non-linear, Dragon Quest III was the most substantial example of open-world gameplay among the early Dragon Quest games. It also allowed the player to swap characters in and out of the party at will, and another "major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day."</desc>

		<name>Tetris</name>
		<desc>A random sequence of tetrominoes (sometimes called "tetrads" in older versions)—shapes composed of four square blocks each—fall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the "well" or "matrix"). The objective of the game is to manipulate these tetrominoes, by moving each one sideways and rotating it by 90 degree units, with the aim of creating a horizontal line of blocks without gaps. When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.

All of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears. I, J, and L are able to clear triples. Only the I tetromino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a "tetris". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific Tetris implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, called "Easy Spin" in Tetris Worlds, certain rare situations allow T, S and Z to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)</desc>

		<name>Tetris (Tengen)</name>
		<desc>The drama surrounding Tetris is one of the most storied sagas in the history of the NES. Tengen, an ambitious Atari-associated game developer, began releasing official NES games in 1988. Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic games not only on the NES, but of all-time.</desc>

		<path>./Goonies, The (VS).zip</path>
		<name>The Goonies</name>
		<desc>The Goonies is a side-scrolling action-adventure game from Konami that was first released on the Japanese Famicom in 1986 and quickly ported to the Sharp X1, MSX and PC-8801. A Famicom Disk System followed a couple years later: this version was only made available via the Disk Writer service. The game finally saw its US debut with the Arcade adaptation Vs. The Goonies from the PlayChoice-10 range.

The game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story and is better known to US audiences. The game is not to be confused with the 1985 Datasoft game for the C64, Atari 8-Bit and Spectrum which was closer to The Lost Vikings with its co-operative puzzles.

Gameplay:
The game features Mikey as he runs around various stages based on locations from the movie - the closed restaurant that the Fratellis use as a hideout, the caverns beneath the restaurant and One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship - saving his friends and recovering keys. In order to progress, Mikey must find three keys and the captive Goonie on each stage. As well as bats, rats and other hostile wildlife, Mikey is being pursued by the three Fratelli family members: they cannot be defeated, but can be stunned temporarily.

Mikey can find power-ups that help him proceed. The most important of these are bombs which destroy walls marked by skulls and reveal keys and captive Goonies behind them. Permanent bonuses like headphones (which prevents Mikey being hurt by Jake Fratelli's opera singing) and a backpack (which allows Mikey to carry two bombs at once) can also be found, but only once and each in a specific stage.</desc>

		<desc>Nintendo GOLF lets you choose your clubs, change your stance, control your swings - even select the angle of impact! You'll view the hole from both close up and far away, judge the changing conditions of the green, and measure the wind velocity. But watch out! When the wind changes, so does the flight of your ball. With Nintendo's state-of-the-art graphics and realistic game play, you'll really believe you're on the fairways. So play Nintendo GOLF, because there's not a video golf game on par with it anywhere!</desc>

		<desc>M.U.S.C.L.E. (Millions of Unusual Small Creatures Lurking Everywhere) is an early NES wrestling game based on the line of toys popular in the 1980s. M.U.S.C.L.E. allows you to choose two wrestling stars from the M.U.S.C.L.E. universe (from a selection of eight) in a tag-team match tournament in one player mode, and versus a friend in two player mode. Each wrestler has one special move that can be used by collecting the power pellet that floats around the ring at random instances.</desc>

		<desc>Star Luster (スターラスター Sutā Rasutā?) is a first-person shooter and space combat simulator video game developed and published by Namco in 1985 only in Japan. It is an arcade-style, combat-dedicated, sci-fi flight simulator that was first released for the Family Computer. That same year, Nintendo adapted the title for play in the arcade as part of their Nintendo VS. System.

The game's setting takes place in the UGSF universe, shared by other Namco games like Galaxian, StarBlade, Ace Combat 3, Bounty Hounds, and New Space Order. The game features free-roaming open space exploration, a cockpit view where the cockpit controls could be seen (and where the cockpit bobs up and down), bases where the player can be refueled, a map and radar displaying the locations of enemies and bases, a warp ability that allows the player to be warped to anywhere on the map, and a date system keeping track of the current date which can change when warping long distances. The game also introduced the concept of a regenerating shield mechanic.</desc>

The only way to progress through the game is to solve challenging riddles in each stage, each one more difficult than the last. Unless the player solves the riddle completely and meets certain criteria, the stage repeats over and over, thus making it harder to complete the game.</desc>

		<name>The Goonies</name>
		<desc>The Goonies is a side-scrolling action-adventure game from Konami that was first released on the Japanese Famicom in 1986 and quickly ported to the Sharp X1, MSX and PC-8801. A Famicom Disk System followed a couple years later: this version was only made available via the Disk Writer service. The game finally saw its US debut with the Arcade adaptation Vs. The Goonies from the PlayChoice-10 range.

The game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story and is better known to US audiences. The game is not to be confused with the 1985 Datasoft game for the C64, Atari 8-Bit and Spectrum which was closer to The Lost Vikings with its co-operative puzzles.

Gameplay:
The game features Mikey as he runs around various stages based on locations from the movie - the closed restaurant that the Fratellis use as a hideout, the caverns beneath the restaurant and One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship - saving his friends and recovering keys. In order to progress, Mikey must find three keys and the captive Goonie on each stage. As well as bats, rats and other hostile wildlife, Mikey is being pursued by the three Fratelli family members: they cannot be defeated, but can be stunned temporarily.

Mikey can find power-ups that help him proceed. The most important of these are bombs which destroy walls marked by skulls and reveal keys and captive Goonies behind them. Permanent bonuses like headphones (which prevents Mikey being hurt by Jake Fratelli's opera singing) and a backpack (which allows Mikey to carry two bombs at once) can also be found, but only once and each in a specific stage.</desc>

		<desc>The nations nuclear strike capability is no longer under the control of the united states government. The destructive thermonuclear force of 10,000 warheads has been hijacked by a madman!

Elvin Atombender is a bonafide genius, a technological wizard, a terminally ill criminal mastermind who is trying to carve his name in the history books with a nuclear firestorm. This lunatic using a powerful electromutative computer virus has not only infected 90% of the nation's computers but has reprogrammed the national defense computers to destroy several major cities within 24 hours.

Now it's up to you. You must pentrate his headquarters. The gigantic starcom international building and search for information and weapons. Use stealth and cunning to outwit his advanced robotic security force. It will take more than guts to navigate the maze of elevators and passage ways that link the eight towers of elvin's stronghold.

Remember, no mission is impossible</desc>

		<desc>Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.

The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment.</desc>

Players use side B of the Power Pad accessory (a floor mat with 12 pads in a 4 by 3 grid) to follow the movements of an aerobics instructor. To succeed the player must press the pads with their feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.</desc>

		<name>The Goonies</name>
		<desc>The Goonies is a side-scrolling action-adventure game from Konami that was first released on the Japanese Famicom in 1986 and quickly ported to the Sharp X1, MSX and PC-8801. A Famicom Disk System followed a couple years later: this version was only made available via the Disk Writer service. The game finally saw its US debut with the Arcade adaptation Vs. The Goonies from the PlayChoice-10 range.

The game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story and is better known to US audiences. The game is not to be confused with the 1985 Datasoft game for the C64, Atari 8-Bit and Spectrum which was closer to The Lost Vikings with its co-operative puzzles.

Gameplay:
The game features Mikey as he runs around various stages based on locations from the movie - the closed restaurant that the Fratellis use as a hideout, the caverns beneath the restaurant and One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship - saving his friends and recovering keys. In order to progress, Mikey must find three keys and the captive Goonie on each stage. As well as bats, rats and other hostile wildlife, Mikey is being pursued by the three Fratelli family members: they cannot be defeated, but can be stunned temporarily.

Mikey can find power-ups that help him proceed. The most important of these are bombs which destroy walls marked by skulls and reveal keys and captive Goonies behind them. Permanent bonuses like headphones (which prevents Mikey being hurt by Jake Fratelli's opera singing) and a backpack (which allows Mikey to carry two bombs at once) can also be found, but only once and each in a specific stage.</desc>

It is an arcade-style, combat-dedicated, sci-fi flight simulator that was first released for the Family Computer. That same year, Nintendo adapted the title for play in the arcade as part of their Nintendo VS. System.

The game's setting takes place in the UGSF universe, shared by other Namco games like Galaxian, StarBlade, Ace Combat 3, Bounty Hounds, and New Space Order. The game features free-roaming open space exploration, a cockpit view where the cockpit controls could be seen (and where the cockpit bobs up and down), bases where the player can be refueled, a map and radar displaying the locations of enemies and bases, a warp ability that allows the player to be warped to anywhere on the map, and a date system keeping track of the current date which can change when warping long distances. The game also introduced the concept of a regenerating shield mechanic.</desc>

Meanwhile, on board the spaceship Vulture, Professor T. Bird and the trio of Battletoads - Rash, Zitz and Pimple - are escorting the Princess Angelica back to her home planet, where her father, the Terran Emperor, awaits her safe arrival. Along the way, Pimple, the biggest Battletoad, takes Angelica out for a cruise in the Toadster to a nearby Leisure Station, but the Dark Queen ambushes them before they can get there, and they are kidnapped and carried away to Ragnarok's World, the Dark Queen's planet.

		<name>To the Earth</name>
		<desc>In the year 2050 the Earth has been attacked by the villainous Raggosians and it is your job to save the planet! You will need to pilot your ship, The Tempest, to the planets Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Earth in order to retrieve certain minerals which can be used to fight the Raggosians. The Raggosians will be trying to stop you from reaching these destinations, though, so you need to use the Nintendo zapper to fight back. Numerous (and very fast!) enemy ships will fly by on the screen and attempt to destroy your ship. You need to shoot the ships and incoming missiles before your ship takes too much damage. From time to time a comet will fly by, and if you shoot this a temporary barrier will be formed that protects your ship from enemy fire. Occasionally you can also earn a smart bomb which appears in the bottom of the screen and destroys all enemies if shot. Each level ends with a large boss which will take multiple hits to destroy.</desc>

		<name>Lemmings</name>
		<desc>Lemmings was one of the most popular computer games of its time, and several gaming magazines gave it some of their highest review scores at the time.

The behavior of the creatures in Lemmings is based on the supposed behavior of real lemmings, who by urban legend are believed to go on migrations en masse that eventually lead to disaster. The basic objective of the game is to guide lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.</desc>

		<desc>You've saved the innocent people of Gradius from the vile Bacterions. But now an even deadlier plague has slimed into the neighborhood. It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you!

This game is also known in the japanese Famicom and Arcades as "Salamander".</desc>
