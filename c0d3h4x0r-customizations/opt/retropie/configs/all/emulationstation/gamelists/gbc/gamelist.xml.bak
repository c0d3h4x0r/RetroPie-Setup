That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

		<path>./Adventures of Pinocchio, The (J).zip</path>
		<name>The Adventures of Pinocchio</name>
		<desc>Adventures of Pinocchio is a beta version of Ottifanten, an action puzzle game developed by Bit Managers and released in 1998 for the GameBoy, based on some German comics. While there is a released Pinocchio game for the Game Boy mono, “Adventures of…” is a completely different title and Bit Managers never listed this one on their homepage, only Ottifanten. A playable version of this beta was leaked online, and it’s often confused for an official released game. Trying out the game shows that you cannot lose any lives – the counter won’t work. This is no final release and there is none because it’s an unreleased game.

As we can read in a Wikipedia entry, the game relies on 115 separate levels of puzzle action, played by viewing the playing field in isometric projection. Pinocchio’s main objective is to get to the arrow (the exit) on the screen in order to move onto the next level. If the player is able to navigate Pinocchio to the objective before the timer runs out, he gets a certain number of points equal to the time left. Once this number reaches 500, the Fairy will bestow Pinocchio with an extra life.

A closer look at the dump floating around will reveal a weird internal name “Infrey Quest”, so we can speculate that before Pinocchio and Ottifanten, Bit Managers tried to develop their own original IP. When they did not find any publisher interested in Infrey Quest, they changed the game in Pinocchio and later into Ottifanten, with their more recognized characters.

Ottifanten uses the same game concept as well and the same music as Adventure of Pinocchio. It even looks like the basic stage design is the same.</desc>

While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time.

To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked.

Alfred can receive a few powerups during the game. For one power up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make Mr Pekles (a giant flower) give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting things and hurting enemies. Another power up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. You must find a can of worms to get this power up.</desc>

However, when the Predators move in for the hunt, they find they are vastly outnumbered and suffer the same fate. Only one of them survives. He theorizes that among the hatched Aliens there was a queen that laid additional eggs, which would explain the huge number of Aliens. The last survivor sets out to destroy the queen and regain the honor of his clan.

The Predator must traverse several side-scrolling levels on his way to the queen, while destroying Aliens in all their forms - facehuggers hatched from eggs, chestburster aliens and fully grown warriors. Various weapons are available: the standard weapon are the wrist blades. Ammunition for the shoulder cannon, the cutting disks and bombs must be picked up. The bombs not only work as weapons but can also be used to destroy barriers. To avoid a fight altogether, the Predator can also use his invisibility system, which runs down the energy supply. To recharge it, energy powerups must be collected. Also hidden in the levels are keys that open up doors blocking the way into the next area. A small radar map helps in navigating the maze-like corridors and also displays approaching enemies.</desc>

There are a certain amount of lines with switches and dots that need activating.[3] Once all the lines are cleared, so are any enemies that are remaining in that level. A strict time limit make players lose their lives in addition to bumping into an enemy.

There is no regularity to the movement of the character, giving an element of luck to the game. Some aspects of background graphics appear in certain levels (especially on levels 12, 20, 28, and 36).  Level 40 is essentially a giant maze which leads up to a castle that ends the game.</desc>

		<name>Army Men</name>
		<desc>Army Men is a mission-based combat game that has you guiding a green plastic commando named Sarge in warfare against a tan-colored toy army. Soldiers use bazookas, grenades, flamethrowers, mortars, automatic rifles, and land mines to trash each other. You can also drive jeeps and tanks across the varied terrain. To help you learn the controls, a boot camp option offers a series of eight training missions. 

Once you are ready, choose from two campaigns: desert and alpine. Review your objectives before each mission on the briefing screen, and prepare for battle against an onslaught of plastic troops. A mission will fail if you exceed the time limit, allow your rivals to win, or let Sarge die. The options screen lets you view current objectives, consult a strategic map, exit vehicles, and abort your mission. You can also adjust the control scheme, select a difficulty level, and toggle music.</desc>

There's a catch, though: to access the whole set of mini-games, you have to win Bonus Tokens by playing in "adventure" mode. By Belenos, this is a game for the truly indomitable!</desc>

		<desc>Asteroids is a conversion of the arcade game of the same name.

Play the role of a spaceship pilot trapped in a gigantic asteroid cloud and pulverize incoming asteroids with the ship's photon cannon. When all asteroids are destroyed, the player can then move on to the next round. In addition to the asteroids, the player will also face an Alien Robot Saucer which shoots randomly across the screen.

The player using the controller may rotate the ship (left or right) to any direction or move the ship forward. Shots will be fired according to the ship direction. The player has three reserved ships available to replace a destroyed spaceship. The spaceship is destroyed if an asteroid collides with the spaceship or is shot by an Alien Robot Saucer. Additionally, the player may opt to use the hyperspace warp to avoid collision. The warp however, may also destroy the spaceship in the process.

Asteroids when shot will break-up into smaller pieces or be destroyed. There are three types of asteroids: large asteroids, medium asteroids, and small asteroids. Large asteroids and medium asteroids when shot, will break-up into two smaller sized asteroids. Small asteroids when shot will be destroyed. 

Alien Robot Saucers come in two sizes: small and large. Both use photon lasers to shoot and will explode when destroyed. Alien Robot Saucers will not appear at the Novice Level.</desc>

		<name>Atomic Punk</name>
		<desc>There are four modes of gameplay in Atomic Punk, including two single player modes and two multiplayer game modes.

Solo:

"Game A" (known as "Bomber Boy" in the Japanese version) is similar to other games in the series, with a few differences. Power-ups, known as panels, which are usually gained in each level and carried over from one to the next, can also be bought from a store by using GP, which is collected depending on how much time it takes to complete a level and how many blocks are destroyed. At the beginning of each round, the player decides which panels to use to complete the round. Another difference is that the linear gameplay of the original, with the player advancing levels after completing each one, was changed to implement a world map with nine locations.

The second game mode, "Game B" (known as "Bomber Man" in the Japanese version) is the same as that in the original Bomberman game, but the stage area is squared rather than rectangular and the screen is always centered on Bomberman rather than scrolling when he touches the border.

Vs.:

Panel Mode, in which players begin with only one bomb to place at a time and a bomb blast length of one unit, and Bomb Up and Fire Up panels appear.

Powerful Mode, in which players have four bombs to place at a time and a bomb blast length of four units, and no panels appear.</desc>

		<name>Bonk's Adventure</name>
		<desc>The game's protagonist is Bonk, a strong caveboy who battles anthropomorphic dinosaurs and other prehistoric themed enemies. Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green, Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur). In the Arcade version, Bonk is also assisted by a female version of himself.</desc>

		<name>Bonk's Revenge</name>
		<desc>In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.

Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to "bonk" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.

The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.</desc>

		<name>Metal Walker</name>
		<desc>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena. As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.

Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.</desc>

Bases Loaded features baseball action with two game modes, USA mode or Japan mode. The difference between the two modes is that the Japan mode contains faster pitches.

		<name>Bases Loaded</name>
		<desc>This game is the first installment of the Bases Loaded series, followed by seven sequels across three generations of consoles.


Bases Loaded features baseball action with two game modes, USA mode or Japan mode. The difference between the two modes is that the Japan mode contains faster pitches. After selecting your mode of play you are given a choice of two teams: East and West. You can perform all of the basics of major league baseball: pitch, hit, field, pickoffs, pinch hit, and bring in a relief pitcher. Gameplay is viewed from a different perspective when hitting and when pitching. Link with a friend's Game Boy to go head-to-head.</desc>

		<desc>He's totally new. Totally tough. And he'll stop at nothing to make sure justice prevails!
From the dark streets of GOTHAM CITY to the deepest corners of the criminal underground comes the CAPED CRUSADER as you've never seen him before.

Incredibly strong. Armed to the teeth. And ready to put his life on the line for the sake of all, on a search-and-destroy mission to end THE JOKER'S reign of terror. He leaps, he flies, he dodges enemy fire and delivers it right back ... with a vengeance.

This is no kid stuff. This is as real as video gaming gets. If you liked what you saw in the movie, you're gonna love what you see here. Because this time around, BATMAN is all business, and he won't let anything ... anything ... stand in his way.</desc>

		<name>Arcade Classics: Battlezone / Super Breakout</name>
		<desc>Battlezone:
 A standard enemy tank in the player's sights in the military training version The Bradley Trainer.
Gameplay is on a plain with a mountainous horizon featuring a memorable erupting volcano, distant crescent moon, and various geometric solids (in vector outline) like pyramids and blocks. The player views the screen, which includes an overhead radar view to find and destroy the rather slow tanks, or the faster moving supertanks. Saucer-shaped UFOs and guided missiles occasionally appear for a bonus opportunity. The saucers differ from the tanks in that they do not fire upon the player, and do not appear on radar. The player can hide behind the solids or maneuver in rapid turns once fired on to buy time with which to fire himself. Common play in the US could run from 25 cents to a dollar per game, depending on machine setting. The typical setting is for 25 cent play, with three tanks.

A standard enemy tank is worth 1,000 points, a supertank 3,000 points, and the flying saucer 5,000 points. The guided missile is worth 2,000 points when destroyed. Each of these targets can be destroyed with a single shot from the player's tank. An extra life is awarded when the player's score reaches 15,000 points, and a further tank is then awarded at 100,000 points. No additional tanks are awarded until the score counter rolls over at ten million, and additional bonus tanks are again awarded at indicated scores of 15,000 and 100,000. The game only includes one hostile enemy on the game board at all times; the player never has to battle two enemy tanks at once, or a tank and guided missile. The UFO can appear on the screen at the same time as an enemy tank, and it can occasionally be destroyed by enemy fire.

The geometric solid obstacles are indestructible, and can block the movement of a player's tank. However, they are also useful as shields as they also block enemy fire as well.

There was a bug in some machines which caused very high phony scores into the seven digits to be posted (after a player would enter his initials). Good players could actually reach this level after an hour or two of play.


SUPER BREAKOUT:
In Super Breakout, there are three different and more advanced game types from which the player can choose:
Double gives the player control of two bats at the same time—one placed above the other—and two balls. Losing a life occurs only when both balls go out of play, and points are doubled while the player is able to juggle both balls without losing either.
Cavity retains the single bat and ball of Breakout, but two other balls are enclosed on the other side of the wall, which the player must free before they, too, can be used to destroy additional bricks. Points are increased for this, but triple points are available if the player can keep all three balls in play.
Progressive also has the single bat and ball, but as the ball hits the paddle, the entire wall gradually advances downwards step by step, gaining in speed the longer the ball lasts in play.</desc>

The object is to sink the opponent's entire fleet without him sinking the player's fleet first. In this updated version, both the player and the computer get extra firepower from military aircraft and support weapons. There are even scenarios that start a player off in a pre-played game that he must resume (and overcome a bleak scenario).</desc>

		<name>Beethoven: The Ultimate Canine Caper!</name>
		<desc>Beethoven's 2nd is a platform game where you get a chance to wear the metaphorical shoes of Beethoven - that lovable, big dog from the movie.

Your four puppies need to be rescued and brought back to their mom. As a responsible father and guardian you'll first need to find the puppy, avoiding dangers such as bad-tempered cats, mean dogcatchers, acorns which have a habit to drop down just when you pass underneath, and careless skateboarders. You can bark at these opponents to scare them away. And if you'll find a source of water (such as a rubber hose), you can make yourself wet and then - in a tense situation - shake off the water, eliminating everyone in the vicinity. 

Once you find your pup, you'll find out that getting him back to his mom is no easy task. While your puppy can - thankfully - walk on his own accord when you put him down, you'll still have to carry it over obstacles, and you'll be forced to fight all the enemies again while doing it.</desc>

		<name>Bill Elliot's NASCAR Fast Tracks</name>
		<desc>Players compete against fifteen computer opponents, including Bill Elliott, who normally wins races that the player does not. Players can choose to run a single race, or the season championship. The season championship is comprised of eight races, consisting of each of the four tracks run twice. The distances for the races is selected by the player, and ranges from 10 miles to 500 miles. Players receive points towards the championship based on the points structure of the actual NASCAR Winston Cup series. Another separate game score is tallied inside the game, awarding higher points for longer race distances chosen. A bug possibly appears in the game, as frequently when the full distance is chosen for the season championship, some races are run with extended distances.

The Game Boy version is very similar to the NES version, except that Atlanta replaced Talladega. Additionally, Pontiac is excluded and players chose between a Ford, Chevrolet or Oldsmobile.</desc>

Now Bill and Ted must travel across time to retrieve the time fragments to prevent the future from altering. But it won't be easy for the San Dimas duo. As DeNomolos has the aid of the evil robot Bill and Ted, plus he has brainwashed Death and some historical figures to stop them along the way.

Each level takes place on a single screen. Players must collect scattered time fragments while jumping platforms, climbing ladders or ropes, and avoiding enemies. Because this is a Game Boy game, all sprites are very simplistic as both Bill and Ted have almost identical game sprites. In addition, enemies are only differentiated by their actions.</desc>

She'll ask Billy Bob to fetch her rabbits or bass, and it's up to you to help Billy Bob get them. Obviously, to get the things she wants you'll have to either go hunting or fishing. Not so fast though, because you need bullets for hunting, bait for fishing, and a license to do either of the two activities. Luckily, you can earn these items by playing a variety of mini-games. The games vary in their gameplay, but the usual assortment of speed and reflex tests are the common thread. You'll need to clear four mini-games each to go hunting and fishing. Once you've finally cleared them and gotten the items you need, you'll head out to catch your real prize. BILLY BOB'S HUNTIN' AND FISHIN' is for one player and is compatible only with Game Boy Color.</desc>

		<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon</name>
		<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon was a video game developed by Arc System Works and published for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel (Bandai) in 1992. It was one of the first Sailor Moon-related video games to be released.

In this game, the player controlled Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon. The storyline was based on the first, third, and fourth episodes of the first season of the anime. Although they originally had not yet appeared in those episodes, in the game Usagi could meet and talk to Ami and Rei, who were NPCs (non-player characters).

The three levels were divided into two parts. First, Usagi could walk through the city, school or a health spa, occassionally talking to people. After talking to the right people, Usagi turned into Sailor Moon and entered another kind of level in which she fought numerous enemies.

By default, Sailor Moon could only use kicking attacks. Pressing the "down" button would make Sailor Moon sit down and cry, and if there were rocks on the wall nearby, her high-pitched crying would make the rocks explode and drop special items. These items gave different powers: one enabled her to use Moon Tiara Action for a limited number of times, one made her invincible for a short amount of time, etc.

The bosses were Morga, Kyurene, Jadeite, and Queen Beryl. Sailor Moon actually had to fight Jadeite each time after defeating the two Youma, and at the end of the last level, had to fight him again before facing Queen Beryl.</desc>

		<name>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R</name>
		<desc>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon R was a video game released for the Nintendo Game Boy by Angel Studios in 1994.

In this game, the player could play using "story mode" or "arcade mode." In story mode, the player began play with Usagi Tsukino/Sailor Moon, then Chibiusa, then the Inner Senshi. Gameplay alternated between a story chapter where the player walked around the map and talked to other characters, followed by a platform level, and a boss room. In arcade mode, the player chose a character, and the non-combat parts of the game are skipped.

In both modes, the game was complete after five stages, most of which were rather short. The boss rooms sometimes started with a scene with Tuxedo Mask where the player would receive an extra life for picking up the rose item. Other items the player could pick up included hearts, which refilled some health, cake slices, which refilled more health, and a tiara, which offered a power-up to the character's attacks.</desc>

		<desc>There are only two lakes to fish at and a limited set of lures; unlike the Super NES video game Super Black Bass. Casting is done on an overhead view with a meter for the direction and another meter for the shadow of the fish. Trout, pike, catfish, and the infamous black bass can all be caught in this game.

The Game Boy Color version allows players to play against 99 AI-controlled fishermen. Tournament hours are twelve non-real time hours long and all locations are fictional. Each game originally came with a 40-page instruction manual and a precautions booklet. Both versions of the game notify players when they have lost their lure and/or their fish through a text-based message. Once a player runs out of a certain kind of fishing lure, it cannot be recovered until the next gameplay.</desc>

		<desc>Blades of Steel differs from the professional game in the NHL in the late 1980s in that it has no offside rule, and its interpretation of penalties is somewhat unique. The game's officials only call two penalties. Players who lose a fistfight are penalized for two minutes, an abstract reworking of the five-minute offsetting majors normally assigned in the event of a fight. Should a fight break out in front of one team's net, then the player on offense gets a penalty shot. The penalty shot is administered in the style of a soccer penalty shot, in that the shooting player must stand on the blue line, instead of moving towards the goaltender. The game also recognizes icing infractions, with an appropriate game reset and faceoff in the liable team's zone.</desc>

		<name>Harvest Moon 3</name>
		<desc>The third entry in the down-home series of RPGs boasts a bevy of new options and features. You can play as a male or female farmer, get married, play with new pets and enjoy new minigames.

Essentially a farming role-playing game, Harvest Moon 3 requires you to clear a patch of land, till the soil, plant seeds and tend the new shoots. Take a twice-weekly ferry to the mainland (the island locale is new to this game) to purchase animals and other supplies.

Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the lack of swordplay, magic spells and other traditional RPG fare, the Harvest Moon series exerts its own unique charm that has won over thousands of would-be farmers worldwide.</desc>

Once again you must get into your armour and journey to the underground caves in order to discover the truth behind the new menace.

Blaster Master Boy is a "somewhat" direct sequel of Blaster Master, your mission is to control your character through a series of underground dungeons from a top-down perspective and defeat the enemies you encounter there. You no longer have your trusty tank to take with you in side scrolling areas, nor your grenades, but to aid you in the dungeons you now have the ability to carry special bombs which can be used to kill enemies as well as clear paths through the dungeons à la Bomber King.</desc>

Bonk's mission is to rescue Princess Za (a small pink Pleisiosaur-type reptile) who has been kidnapped by the evil King Drool (a large, green, Tyrannosaurus-type dinosaur).

		<name>Bonk's Revenge</name>
		<desc>In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.

Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to "bonk" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.

The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.</desc>

The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.</desc>

Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.</desc>

		<name>Brain Drain</name>
		<desc>Brain Drain is a puzzle game in which the player has to recreate a pattern, consisting of different symbols like apples or hearts, which is shown in the corner of the screen. The main playing field consists of said symbols, but randomly switched around. The player controls a frame which encloses four of the symbols. When pressing a button, the symbols are rotated clockwise around the frame. Of course the levels have to be solved within a time limit.

In the higher difficulty levels, the player also has to deal with so-called special effects which occasionally kick in during play, e.g. some symbols get hidden by "?" blocks, symbols rotate on their own or the controls are reversed. Three power-ups can be earned by completing bonus levels or finishing a level really fast: clock (stops time for 20 seconds), flash (skips the current level) and credit (gives a second try after time has run out). Clock and flash have to be activated manually; credits is applied automatically. Besides the regular playing mode, there is also the "Brain Race" available which involves solving a certain number of levels (depending on the difficulty) as fast as possible.</desc>

		<name>Bram Stoker's Dracula</name>
		<desc>While based on the 1992 film of the same name, the game had very little to do with the actual movie. Several weapons can be used; ranging from the basic knife to the advanced shotgun weapon.

The 16-bit renditions of the game were straightforward hack and slash games where players had to slash generic enemies in order to get to Dracula. There is a time limit that forces players to move quickly around the levels. Each chapter of the game starts off with a cover from a book. Checkpoints are used to maintain progress in a level after losing a life. Each level has a daytime and night time equivalent. A boss appears at the end of each night time level in order to test the playing skills and to reinforce the concepts that were taught in the daytime version of the level.

The player controls a young lawyer named Jonathan Harker. Harker must free himself from Dracula's capture, follow him to London, and end his reign of terror.</desc>

		<desc>In the game, the player must move the cursor amongst a grid of different colored squares. All squares must be "removed", and squares can only be removed if they are directly touching two or more squares of the same color. Once squares are removed, blocks then shift downward and either to the left or right, to fill in the blanks. The game ends when either all blocks are removed, or time has run out.

If the player comes to a point in which none of the remaining square match, a few options remain. A few "special items" help clear out blocks that don't necessarily match, such as an airplane block that eliminates a full line of square in the direction it is pointed in, or a block of dynamite that blows up every square touching it. Additionally, the player can also chose to drop new, randomly generated squares into the equation.</desc>

Bubble Bobble is a platform game, with each level being a single screen. The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.</desc>

When the player finishes a level, that player can proceed to the next level. Each new level starts with a new short animation from the movie. If the player collects all of the bonus items in a level, that player gets a bonus movie. Bonus items include 50 pieces of grain, four letters that spell F-L-I-K (like the Tarzan N64 game) and permanently finishing off each enemy bug. To guide the player through the levels there are little floating telescopes that will show the player areas where he is supposed to go. Throughout each level are a variety of types of seeds. Some seeds are partially buried in the ground. These seeds can be transformed by Flik into a specific kind of plant that can help him solve problems within the levels. Flik can increase the number of plants he can grow by collecting colored tokens scattered throughout the levels, with a token's color determining what type of plant can be grown with it. Some levels also included Flik’s harvesting invention (hidden somewhere in the level) which can be used to collect grain and kill off enemy bugs.</desc>

		<name>The Bugs Bunny Crazy Castle</name>
		<desc>While presented in a side-scroller format, Crazy Castle differed from standard side-scrollers such as Super Mario Bros. in that Bugs Bunny did not have a jump function; therefore, only by taking different routes could Bugs avoid enemies. Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

		<desc>When humankind discovers an alien race on a distant planet, it becomes clear that the extra-terrestrial way of life threatens survival on Earth. Rather than sending out a fleet of space destroyers or loads of nuclear warheads, it is determined that Earth's best chance of wiping out these creatures is (drum roll, please) you! As Space Marauder, it is your job to avoid waves of space beings careening through the outer reaches of the galaxy. You are aiding only by a jet pack and a laser gun. Sound tough? It is. Assorted power-ups are strewn about to help you in your plight, but the best asset you'll have is your itchy trigger finger and taste for alien blood. Lots of powerful bosses wait at the end of each of the game's levels, and every stage presents new and increasingly difficult challenges for our hero. Boasting a cool soundtrack and smooth controls, there's plenty of gameplay to keep your fingers moving for hours on end.</desc>

		<name>BurgerTime Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Based on BurgerTime, the Arcade classic from 1982, BurgerTime Deluxe once again puts you in the role of chef Peter Pepper, a guy who can really build a burger. You maneuver the cook up and down ladders and left and right across floors in order to walk across various parts of giant hamburgers, such as large lettuce, big buns and massive meat patties. After you cross any section of any hamburger, it will drop one level and push any other burger part within that stack down a floor as well. The object of the game is to build all the hamburgers in each stage by dropping all the makings of each burger into completed stacks at the bottom of the screen.

As you go about your burger building business, Food Foes Mr. Pickle, Mr. Egg and Mr. Hot dog (also known as Frank N. Furter) will chase after you. You can destroy these culinary cutups by trapping them in falling burger parts or by tricking them into walking on a burger part you are in the process of dropping. To freeze the Food Foes, you can sprinkle a dash of pepper on them. You begin the game with a small pepper supply and can pick up additional pepper shakers that appear throughout the levels. You can also pick up bonus points (in the guise of cups and saucers) and extra lives.

Unlike the original BurgerTime, which had less than 10 different non-scrolling screens, BurgerTime Deluxe has seven levels with four stages in each level for a grand total of 28 screens, most of which scroll to some degree. A password feature enables you to return to the beginning of last level you played. Also, this version of the game features a two-player competitive mode (as long as you have two copies of the game, an extra Game Boy, and a link cable).</desc>

Besides the obvious differences because of technical limitations of the platform, e.g. the bubbles have to differentiated from of their shades instead of colour, it also has less playing modes. Only the arcade mode (a port of the original arcade version with the main singleplayer campaign or the possibility to challenge an AI opponent) and the challenge mode (beating a series of 25 levels as fast as possible) are available. 

Regarding gameplay, this is a tile matching game. There are bubbles of varying shades at the top of the screen and the player controls a stationary cannon at the bottom of the screen. The cannon is loaded with one bubble at the time and the direction of the shot can be varied left and right. The goal is to clear the screen by matching bubbles of the same colour.</desc>

		<name>Daedalian Opus</name>
		<desc>The game is essentially a series of 36 jigsaw puzzles with Tetris-like pieces known as pentominos that must be assembled into a specific shape. The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle.

After completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.</desc>

You play as a hunter looking to catch a nice trophy in one of four different areas using three different weapons. Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you'll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you'll have to find the one that works best for you.

		<name>Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf</name>
		<desc>After terrorist leader General Kilbaba has seized control of an unnamed "small but wealthy" Gulf emirate, overthrown the monarchy and installed himself as dictator, the United States sends a lone helicopter to destroy his army in a series of swift strikes. The game's plot was felt by commentators to be a thinly disguised reference to the Gulf War, while comparisons were drawn between Kilbaba and Saddam Hussein, and between the game's unnamed desert setting and Iraq.</desc>

		<name>Dexter's Laboratory: Robot Rampage</name>
		<desc>Robots are running amok in Dexter's lab! Based on the popular cartoon series, DEXTER'S LABORATORY: Robot Rampage for the Game Boy Color puts you in the little boots of the Dexter as he tries to reclaim his lab from Mandark's invading mechanical mayhem. You'll have to ride elevators, dive down shafts, hide in shadows, and occasionally blast the robotic intruders as you hunt down your evil nemesis. There are three different outfits you can wear to make infiltrating the lab easier: wear your standard lab-coat or one of two special robo-suits, depending on what the situation calls for. You can also use Dexter's high-tech weapons to dispatch the enemy through level after level of fast and furious action.</desc>

		<name>Diablo</name>
		<desc>A port of Diablo was in development for the GameBoy, but soon cancelled for unknown reasons. This unreleased gem was first shown on PtoPOnline (now SuperiorVersion.com) back in 2007. Prior to that, no media had ever been released, nor had it ever been mentioned by Blizzard. This tech demo is a very unique look at what Diablo could have been, on the original GameBoy.

You can really see this game having massive potential since the PC version wasn’t much better graphically, meaning it would be close to the original. Implementing special features such as link cable multiplayer (since online would not be available) could have made this one of the higher rated games in GameBoy history.</desc>

		<name>Dick Tracy</name>
		<desc>The game's introduction shows that Big Boy has escaped from the state penitentiary and kidnapped Tess, Tracy's love interest. The gameplay itself is purely level-based platforming, foregoing the overhead driving sequences of its NES counterpart.

Stylistically, the Game Boy version bears a strong resemblance to the side-scrolling mode of the NES version. Dick Tracy can punch and use the same weapons (hand gun, Tommy gun, tear gas), as well as grenades (which will instantly kill all non-boss enemies on the screen). This game also shares some common music with the NES version. Each of the five levels contains 12 hidden pieces of a photograph used to solve a puzzle at the end of each level.

At the end of each level, Dick Tracy would fight one of the antagonists from the film, including Shoulders, Flattop, and Pruneface). After defeating the boss, the player would need to solve the twelve-piece puzzle using the pieces found throughout the level to reveal a photo of the next boss to be pursued. If the puzzle could be solved within the allotted period of time, the player would be awarded a bonus life. For every two pieces placed correctly, the player would be awarded with one extra hit point. If any of the missing pieces were missed or if the puzzle isn't solved in time, then the game will automatically piece the whole image together (without any bonuses, of course). Then, Tracy would interrogate the fallen boss for where to search next for clues leading to Big Boy and Tess.</desc>

Loosely based on the computer-animated feature film, players will have to guide Aladar the Iguanadon, Zini the Lemur, and Flia the Pteranodon through 12 different levels, using each of their unique abilities to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies. Aladar's strength and brute force are great assets, but there are times when the smaller, quicker Zini will need to take over. Neither of them will do you any good if a situation calls for the ability to fly, though so it's a good thing Flia is with you on this adventure. Learning to use each of these characters to overcome obstacles is the key to avoiding extinction! With video taken directly from the film and an encyclopedia covering all the creatures in the game, Disney's DINOSAUR will immerse players in a world that existed millions of years ago.</desc>

		<name>Driver: You Are The Wheelman</name>
		<desc>In Driver, the driving (pun intended) force of the world is crime. The main character, an ex-race car driver, takes on the role of an undercover cop. It seems your superior officer has decided to put your talents to the test. He orders you to infiltrate the local mob group, and to help bring it down from the inside. As a result, the game takes place from the perspective of a low-level gang member. The action speeds into a number of different cities, ranging from San Francisco to Miami. It is on the streets that the main part of the game will take place. 

Basically, Driver is broken into a number of mini-missions. In total, over 30 different challenges await the persistent gamer. The missions are divided between the various locales of the game. The different assignments will each require a special tactic. As an example, consider the mission in which the objective is to destroy an enemy getaway vehicle. In such a situation, the primary goal is to keep an eye on the target and ram it into submission. If the orders are to pick up a gang member within a time limit, speed and secrecy become of utmost importance. If the cops see the exchange, the badges will be on you like glue. Each situation will require a measure of thought and intelligence. 

Driver also offers a couple of extra side games. The survival mode sets the player against a horde of maniacal police officers. The crazed cops will do anything to smash you into submission. The result is a race through the city with a bunch of cops on your tail. It is a test of endurance. In the getaway mode, the idea is to flee for safety from the encroaching stiffs. The game places you in an area of the city, with a cop on your tail. Your only goal is to avoid the authorities. Be careful, though, as the cops may set up a roadblock to impede your progress.

Driver is designed with the Game Boy Color in mind. It offers a password save system to keep your data under wraps.</desc>

		<name>Duke Nukem</name>
		<desc>Is Game Boy Color man enough to handle Duke? You'd better believe it.

The master of one-liners and undisputed king of carnage has conquered Nintendo 64, and now he's preparing to get down and dirty on Game Boy Color. The most recent Duke Nukem titles have been played using a first-person perspective, but GT Interactive broke that pattern with Zero Hour for the N64, and this platform adventure for Game Boy Color. Duke's ego must be growing out of control now that millions of gamers will actually be able to admire his pumped-up pecs while playing.

Duke Nukem delivers 16 levels of alien annihilation, with a different visual theme for each area. Duke is equipped with all new moves for his small screen debut, including a perfect backflip which leads us to believe that he may have been dating a gymnast in the off-season.

Duke Nukem is compatible only with Game Boy Color.</desc>

There's no need for a separate digital organizer anymore, as you can now keep track of your life on a Game Boy Color. Everyone's favorite little alien being provides a calendar, an address book, a working clock, and even a "to-do" list that will keep young science fiction fans motivated and productive. There are even five mini-games included, several of which involves helping the titular mascot evade the authorities and collect the necessary items to construct an inter-global telephone system. One of the games challenges you to raise a "Flopgopple" pet, and all of the options are compatible with the Nintendo Game Boy Printer. Kids can even protect all of their personal data with the use of an original password. Now, that's organization.</desc>

All's fair in love and corporate lumberjack matches, though, so Acclaim pulled itself off the canvas and went out in search of a new franchise. The answer lay as close as the nearest TV, where Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) holds court weekly on The Nashville Network. Sealing the deal for a long time to come, Acclaim has invested some of its many WWF and Turok bucks in the ECW.</desc>

		<desc>In the game, the player assumes the role of a spy who infiltrates a building filled with elevators. He must collect secret documents from the building and traverse the 30 floors of the building using an increasingly complex series of elevators. The player is pursued by enemy agents who appear from behind closed doors. These agents must be dealt with via force or evasion. Successful completion of a level involves collecting all the secret documents and traversing the building from top to bottom. In the lower floors of the building, the elevator systems are so complex that some puzzle-solving skills are needed.

The Game Boy includes the ability to acquire different weapons, such as a machine gun that fired more rapidly.</desc>

Elmo is the official welcoming committee to visitors from the Planet Zap, and he needs help counting all the stars so his visiting outerspace pals will turn the Sesame Street lights back on. Four cheerful and challenging games await: "How Many Stars," "Beam That Number," "Adding Countdown," and "Take It Away." In "Stars." you'll count how many stars that a speeding spaceship has left in its wake; "Beam" has you beam a spotlight over three patterns. Correctly match the patterns to the number in the lower right hand of the screen and watch rockets blast into space. "Countdown" has you flying with your jetpack and solving three addition equations, and "Take It Away" is similar, only learning subtraction is the goal.

		<desc>The game features racing in one of two Formula One cars around a variety of tracks near world capitals and landmarks. In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.

Gameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a "LOW" setting and a "HI" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on "skill level 1" while novices get some extra challenge on "skill level 2" and experts get the ultimate challenge on "skill level 3." A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.

Several Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally.[citation needed] Similar to the original, both games were never released outside of Japan.</desc>

In this one-player flight sim, you take the role of a daring pilot who's flying an elite fighter jet. Slide into an inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but don't think that it's all fun and games. When the mission's complete, you'll have to carefully land your jet on an aircraft carrier.</desc>

It was one of the few 8-bit Formula One video games to adequately represent the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve as having an urban background along with several other urban race tracks represented in the 1990 Formula One season with the exception that Circuit de Catalunya is presented in this version as the round in Spain, alltough Jerez hosted the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix. Tire wear is possible resulting in trips to the pit crew for maintenance and repairs. A radio allows communication with the crew chief; he will advise whether repairs are necessary. The top speed of the vehicle is 335 kilometres per hour and turbo is not used in the game.

Before the first qualifying session can take place, the player must insert his name and his nationality. The name can be up to 10 characters long and the country has to fit into a three-character field. Since the game doesn't verify if the three-letter code matches up to a real nationality, it doesn't matter if the player makes up a nationality for a fictional country.</desc>

Once he is strong enough, players can successfully defend themselves against larger fish, seagulls that want to grab unsuspecting players out of the water and cats that want to eat players as a tasty snack. A variety of allies (includuing Octo Dude who is an octopus) can help Fish Dude when the problems grow too intense for him to handle alone.

With only three lives to lose until achieving a "game over" screen, the game requires cunning and dexterity to master. Levels allow players to scroll of the screen at the extreme ends of the field and come back on the other side of the playing field. There are 18 levels that get more difficult as the other fish get faster and more predators are introduced in an attempt to kill off the players. Each level concludes after 20 fish have been consumed.

Passwords are introduced from the third level onwards</desc>

		<desc>The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>

Technology has progressed to the point that air-based nuclear attacks are ineffective, so warfare will be conducted the old-fashioned way: through large-scaled attacks of armored units and infantry. In this one-player strategy or action game, you'll choose to either control the American or the Chinese military forces, each side comprised of the same eight different unit types. From the speed and power of a tactical helicopter attack to the all-out brawn of a platoon of tanks, you'll have all the warfare options you'll need to carry out your plan of attack. In order to complete the game, you'll have to battle your way through 16 different missions that take place all over the world, in such locations as barren snowfields, yawning deserts, and crowded cityscapes.</desc>

The Rescue of Princess Blobette tells the story of a young, male protagonist and his blob companion as they attempt to rescue the latter's girlfriend, the titular Princess Blobette. The damsel in distress has been imprisoned by the Antagonistic Alchemist within the highest tower of the Royal Castle on the planet Blobolinia. Like its predecessor, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, The Rescue of Princess Blobette is a puzzle-platformer in which the player directly controls the boy as he is followed around by the blob, who is controlled by the computer AI. The pair must navigate the various passages and floors of the castle to locate and free Blobette. The boy can only run back and forth, cannot jump or swim, and will die if he falls a long distance or comes in contact with dangerous objects such as flame throwers and sewer serpents. However, the blob can be made to turn into useful tools when he is fed jelly beans of various flavors. Each flavor causes a different transformation. For example, feeding the blob a tangerine jelly bean will change him into a trampoline, which the boy can then use to reach high platforms. The player may also locate extra jelly bean sacks and numerous, optional treasures. Finding five peppermints will increase the player's extra lives by one.</desc>

		<desc>In the Game Boy version of this title, Bonk can turn into one of three unique heroes: Master Bonk, Hungry Bonk, or Stealth Bonk. Becoming Master Bonk dresses Bonk in a cape and provides him with Vulcan-esque ears, and gives him the ability to move faster and jump higher. Becoming Hungry Bonk gives Bonk an animalistic appearance with evil eyes and a mouth full of razor-sharp teeth, and gives bonk the ability to chew enemies to death, as well as providing him with a much stronger head-butt that can kill nearby foes. Becoming Stealth Bonk dresses Bonk in a striped jail outfit, and gives him the ability to enter special locked doors that lead to areas such as the bank, where Bonk can collect Smileys, the butcher's, where Bonk can eat more slabs of meat in hope for a different power-up, and jail, where Bonk loses a portion of his Smileys.

Grabbing one of many tulips scattered throughout the game carries Bonk to a special bonus stage where he can face off against Mechabonk -- a RoboCop-esque version of Bonk—in a best-of-three battle to "bonk" one another off the edge of a small stage. Winning two rounds provides Bonk with an extra life, while a loss transforms Bonk into Wounded Bonk, where Bonk resembles a mummy and takes twice as much damage as usual.

The game overall is very similar to games in the Mario series, providing linear, side-scrolling action, multiple power-ups, and several small boss confrontations leading up to a final boss. Its treatment of power-ups is similar as well: taking a hit while powered-up causes Bonk to take no damage but instead lose his power. For those who struggle with the game, the game offers passwords after game-overs so the player does not need to start over from the beginning.</desc>

		<name>The Game of Harmony</name>
		<desc>The player controls a round spacecraft, and must work to clear all globes from the screen within a time limit. The playing field wraps around at the edges, so a globe or the ship travelling off the left edge (for example) will re-appear on the right. Globes come in three different colors, and those of the same color will disappear when they collide, whereas differing-colored globes will produce small pods, of the third color. Pods can be collected for more energy, but if they are not picked up quickly, they will turn into globes. There are 50 levels of increasing difficulty. On some levels, elastic bands connect certain globes, or even attach the player's ship to one or more globes. Destroying a globe will remove any elastic band attached to it. In other areas, barriers block the movement of the player and the globes. On difficulty settings above "easy", the globes are somewhat volatile. If they are not cleared within a certain time of their appearance, they will explode and damage your ship. If your ship loses enough energy, it is destroyed.</desc>

		<name>Gauntlet II</name>
		<desc>The gameplay is very similar to the original Gauntlet, a topdown dungeon crawl supporting up to four players. The biggest difference from the original game is that players can choose identical classes, instead of being limited to a particular one for each joystick.

The Game Boy version was praised by the German Play Time magazine for its technical implementation (including 8-directional scrolling), faithful recreation of graphics, and for evoking nostalgic feelings with similar sound effects, however this version was criticized for difficult-to-recognize sprites and its technically weak theme music.[</desc>

		<desc>Capcom's arcade-turn-console action platformer Ghosts 'N Goblins is a true 2D classic. The game, which stars Sir Arthur, a knight on a mission to rescue Princess Guinevere, travels players through six huge 2D scrolling levels rained with obstacles, enemies and other infuriating hazards. It was all too easy to meet one's doom at the near end of a stage as the difficulty level is unforgiving and have to start all over, but because of the clever coin-munching design and atmospheric presentation, the drag to keep playing never loosened. It's still regarded as one of the greats. The GBC version, released in 2000, is a direct port of the NES game.</desc>

After taking the approach shot, the ball stops rolling 3-feet from the pin. On the green, you sink the relatively easy putt, and you start your round with a birdie. While most golfers never have days like this, they can with HOLE IN ONE GOLF. Get out on three different courses and try to get the lowest score possible. However, the courses are located in rural areas, so you never know when birds, squirrels, or bears will come onto the course and mess with your shots.

You can go for a high-speed, low-acceleration model, or if you prefer to burn rubber off of the line, you will want to choose a bike with monster acceleration. When you are ready to ride you will have the opportunity to race on four different tracks including the Arizona Desert, Deep South, Florida Everglades, and California Coast.

Essentially a farming role-playing game, Harvest Moon 3 requires you to clear a patch of land, till the soil, plant seeds and tend the new shoots. Take a twice-weekly ferry to the mainland (the island locale is new to this game) to purchase animals and other supplies.

Despite -- or perhaps because of -- the lack of swordplay, magic spells and other traditional RPG fare, the Harvest Moon series exerts its own unique charm that has won over thousands of would-be farmers worldwide.</desc>

		<desc>The world's best strategy games have two things in common: they start with a deceptively simple board and the goal of taking territory from your opponents. Now HEXCITE brings a whole new shape to strategy games. In HEXCITE, 1 or 2 players battle to dominate the board with pieces of different shapes and sizes. Like any great strategy game, HEXCITE is simple to learn, but challenging to master. And every round is unpredictable until the last play. Who knows? HEXCITE could be the shape of things to come!</desc>

		<name>Black Bass: Lure Fishing</name>
		<desc>There are only two lakes to fish at and a limited set of lures; unlike the Super NES video game Super Black Bass. Casting is done on an overhead view with a meter for the direction and another meter for the shadow of the fish. Trout, pike, catfish, and the infamous black bass can all be caught in this game.

The Game Boy Color version allows players to play against 99 AI-controlled fishermen. Tournament hours are twelve non-real time hours long and all locations are fictional. Each game originally came with a 40-page instruction manual and a precautions booklet. Both versions of the game notify players when they have lost their lure and/or their fish through a text-based message. Once a player runs out of a certain kind of fishing lure, it cannot be recovered until the next gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Hyper Lode Runner</name>
		<desc>Your objective is to gather gold that is scattered on the brick platforms, which are connected by ladders. You are chased by robots (cyborgs) that end your character's life if they catch him, though you can stand on their heads. Your main weapon is the ability to dig both to the left and right of your character. The holes you dig are only temporary and fill themselves in. A robot that falls into one of your holes will be destroyed if the hole fills in before it can escape. Your character can also suffer this same fate, ending his life. Destroyed robots are replaced with new ones that appear from the top of the screen. The robots can also carry gold which they drop if they fall into a hole. The robot's movements are dependent on yours, and a significant facet of the game play is figuring out how to use the robot's movements to your advantage in clearing a stage. Besides bricks and ladders, levels also consist of blocks (which can't be dug into), rope (to traverse platform chasms) and crumbling bricks (which you fall through). Once all gold has been retrieved a missing segment of ladder will appear allowing your character to escape to the next level. Some levels contain keys and doors which provide an alternate way to leave a level.</desc>

		<desc>If you're really looking for arcade hits, you can't get much bigger than JOUST and DEFENDER. Lording over the game halls in the days after PAC-MAN and DONKEY KONG had lost their luster, these two giants revolutionized gaming forever. JOUST casts you in the role of a noble knight from the future mounting you on an ostrich and sending you off into battle. Making full use of the ostrich, you'll try to gain altitude and get your opponent from above, collecting magical eggs for extra points. DEFENDER puts you in the pilot's seat of an aerodynamic space ship and shoots you through the expanses of a futuristic city under siege. You'll have to fend off other spacecraft, utilize a whole lot of impressive weaponry, and keep the civilians from turning into ugly mutants. Both games are notable for their influence over those to follow, and both are replicated in fine detail for the Game Boys Color. Challenge the computer, or link up and do battle with a friend.</desc>

		<name>Kingdom Crusade</name>
		<desc>This video game takes places during a hypothetical apocalyptic battle between a dark, evil army and a light, good army.  Even the king and queen of each respective kingdom is expected to contribute to combat duty; which was expected of kings in the Middle Ages but not of most queens.

Even though this game is medieval in nature, it does not depict any culture of Medieval Europe against each other. Players can take either side and both kingdom's units are of equal strength to each other. The units in the game correspond to Western high fantasy (i.e., paladins instead of samurai).  All fighting is done in an arcade manner (real-time with button mashing) rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game (either turn-based or real-time without button mashing).

Each player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to win the game and to defeat his or her opponent.  Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over.</desc>

		<desc>The gluttonous King Dedede has stolen all of the food from the inhabitants of Dream Land for a midnight feast, so Kirby, a resident of Dream Land, goes to retrieve the food and stop Dedede. Kirby's Dream Land plays like other platformers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era of video games: Kirby must use various natural abilities and occasionally external abilities or items while heading toward the goal at the end of each level. Like many 1980s-era platformers, the player can accumulate points, with an extra life granted when the player has enough points. However, because Kirby lacks a save function, scores are not recorded. Also, there are no save files, so the player has to start over again when the Game Boy is turned off, if the player chooses to return to the title screen after a Game Over, or if the player resets the game. All levels are played on a two-dimensional plane, letting Kirby move only left, right, up, and down. Kirby can walk, jump, and fly. Kirby can also inhale objects and enemies, swallowing them or spitting them out as projectiles.</desc>

		<name>Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble</name>
		<desc>Peacefully sleeping in his Dream Land, Kirby drifts lazily amongst the beauty of the sky. A beauty that King Dedede cannot abide with. Jealous of the sky's wondrous splendor, King Dedede has acquired a tool that will let him steal the night's stars, plunging the world into eternal drab daylight. When Kirby awoke, he found that it was still daytime. And evermore, it would be daytime, unless Kirby made the journey to find King Dedede and recover the stars to restore the night's sky. So begins the latest Kirby adventure, another action adventure with the morphing marshmallow in a starnge fantasy world. However, the one thing separating this latest adventure is the control scheme. Here, you don't control Kirby directly. Instead, you guide Kirby by tipping your system to roll the little round pink puff through a series of mazes. If you get in a jam you can make Kirby jump by a controller press, and Kirby can still acquire weapons from other enemies, but the real skill is using the tilting to your advantage.</desc>

		<name>Blades of Steel</name>
		<desc>Blades of Steel differs from the professional game in the NHL in the late 1980s in that it has no offside rule, and its interpretation of penalties is somewhat unique. The game's officials only call two penalties. Players who lose a fistfight are penalized for two minutes, an abstract reworking of the five-minute offsetting majors normally assigned in the event of a fight. Should a fight break out in front of one team's net, then the player on offense gets a penalty shot. The penalty shot is administered in the style of a soccer penalty shot, in that the shooting player must stand on the blue line, instead of moving towards the goaltender. The game also recognizes icing infractions, with an appropriate game reset and faceoff in the liable team's zone.</desc>

		<desc>This ain't no 20-minute workout. It's the ultimate in head-to-head competition, in 8 grueling events. 100 meter dash. Long jump. Hurdles. Javelin. Skeet shooting. Triple jump. Archery. And the high jump. No timeouts, no breathers, no water boys. Just you and your own exhaustion. So get psyched. Pick your level of competition and the opening event. Then block out the roar of the crowd and take a deep breath. Because it's not whether you win or lose. It's whether you survive!</desc>

		<name>Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble</name>
		<desc>Peacefully sleeping in his Dream Land, Kirby drifts lazily amongst the beauty of the sky. A beauty that King Dedede cannot abide with. Jealous of the sky's wondrous splendor, King Dedede has acquired a tool that will let him steal the night's stars, plunging the world into eternal drab daylight. When Kirby awoke, he found that it was still daytime. And evermore, it would be daytime, unless Kirby made the journey to find King Dedede and recover the stars to restore the night's sky. So begins the latest Kirby adventure, another action adventure with the morphing marshmallow in a starnge fantasy world. However, the one thing separating this latest adventure is the control scheme. Here, you don't control Kirby directly. Instead, you guide Kirby by tipping your system to roll the little round pink puff through a series of mazes. If you get in a jam you can make Kirby jump by a controller press, and Kirby can still acquire weapons from other enemies, but the real skill is using the tilting to your advantage.</desc>

		<name>The Lawnmower Man</name>
		<desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

		<name>Le Mans 24 Hours</name>
		<desc>Take a little trip around the world for grueling, 24-hour race action. Based on the annual racing series that takes place in the south of France, this version will lead you from Toronto to Detroit, to the peaks of Everest. Take your pick from 10 real racing vehicles, like the Nissan R390 and the BMW V12VMR. With more than 10 courses to race on, you'll certainly have your work cut out for you. Along the tour, you'll use oil slicks, engine upgrades, invincibility power-ups, and more to get an edge on the competition. The better you do, the more cars you'll be able to unlock, and thereby improving your chances of taking the cup. There are three different play modes: Le Mans pits you against tough competition in a real Le Mans circuit; Championship takes you through a full season; and Arcade allows you play a single race. The graphics are great, the gameplay is smooth, and there are more options than you could ever ask for. Buckle up and put the pedal to the metal!</desc>

		<name>Kingdom Crusade</name>
		<desc>This video game takes places during a hypothetical apocalyptic battle between a dark, evil army and a light, good army.  Even the king and queen of each respective kingdom is expected to contribute to combat duty; which was expected of kings in the Middle Ages but not of most queens.

Even though this game is medieval in nature, it does not depict any culture of Medieval Europe against each other. Players can take either side and both kingdom's units are of equal strength to each other. The units in the game correspond to Western high fantasy (i.e., paladins instead of samurai).  All fighting is done in an arcade manner (real-time with button mashing) rather than a typical manner of a strategy or role-playing game (either turn-based or real-time without button mashing).

Each player must either destroy all of the opponent's units or capture all the castles in order to win the game and to defeat his or her opponent.  Winning results in a celebration screen while losing is the equivalent to a game over.</desc>

		<name>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</name>
		<desc>A Game Boy fantasy adventure like no other!

Nintendo's fantasy adventure hero, Link of Hyrule, returns in this new epic quest...Link's Awakening. Link's newest challenge is set on the mysterious Koholint Island, a place where dreams and reality collide. As a castaway, Link must find a way to escape from the island and return to his beloved homeland of Hyrule.

But it won't be as easy as chartering a boat. The island's inhabitants have no knowledge of the outside world. One creature, a talking Owl, may know the solution to Link's dilemma, but first Link must tackle eight dungeons full of treacherous monsters and tricky taps. His goal: find the eight Instruments of the Sirens and awaken the omnipotent Wind Fish which rules the island.

Link will battle new enemies and make new friends in one of the most in-depth fantasy adventures for Game Boy yet!

A battery-backed memory will save up to three games so you never have to start your journey empty-handed.</desc>

		<name>Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun</name>
		<desc>The Adventures of Tintin: Prisoners of the Sun is based on the Belgian comic book of the same name. The basic plotline is the same: Professor Cuthbert Calculus gets kidnapped and the player, in the role of Tintin, needs to rescue him. The rest is more loosely adapted: in contrast to the comic, which is mostly based in Peru, this game offers many different locations all over the world.

The gameplay itself is a typical platforming action: Tintin walks through the levels while avoiding the enemies. Pretty much everyone, e.g. little girls and security guards, is out to hurt Tintin who has no means of defending himself. This means the most important aspect is learning enemy placements, their patterns and how to avoid them. But he has to hurry because of the time limit. Required for success is the usage of the two playing plains: from the player's perspective in the foreground and further towards the background. Tintin can switch between the two at any time.</desc>

		<desc>The Rugrats are about to find out that the only thing more exciting than traveling through your own backyard is traveling through time. After discovering a time machine, the kids accidentally scatter themselves throughout history, and you're the only one who can reunite the famous babies with their beloved cohorts. Each of the game's 12 levels puts you in charge of a different character, charging you with tasks like finding a lost toy, locating fellow Rugrats, or tracking down mysterious items. The whole debacle begins when Chuckie won't enter the time machine with the other babies, but he changes his mind as soon as the rest if the gang disappears and leaves him all alone. Chuckie's attempt to track down the others puts him in the 1800s, but none of his friends are there. In fact, Tommy is in ancient Egypt, Angelica is at an old circus, Phil is trapped in prehistory, and Dil is, somehow, lost in space! Can you collect all of the lost items and round up the babies before it's too late?</desc>

		<desc>There's money to be had, and it's waiting to be nabbed. Be an ace in Lock'N Chase.

This classic arcade game invites you to play as a thief who's trying to score big by collecting his weight in gold. Duck in and out of alleys while scooping up coins along the way. Maybe you'll get lucky and find some extra treasure. But being on the wrong side of the law is never easy, as the police are hot on your tail. If you think they're coming too close, try using a sliding door or power-up items to block their chase.

Think you can make a clean getaway? Test your skills in Lock'N Chase.</desc>

		<desc>LOGICAL adds a distinctive puzzle game experience to the Game Boy Color. Each of the 99 levels starts with a unique arrangement of pipes and slotted gears. Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order. Try to solve as many puzzles as you can with LOGICAL</desc>

This time you didn't get the pieces you wanted. Never mind - just start another loop. All of a sudden the board's getting just a little too crowded. Now you're struggling to find a place to drop the pieces (who cares where they go, you can't afford to let the timer run down because you'll lose a life). Now it's getting really hectic. Did you honestly think this game was simple (and this is just the first level of Game A). Pretty soon you'll be dreaming about LOOPZ. Wondering if next time you'll be able to make a longer loop than ever before - or more loops than your record. Will LOOPZ drive you crazy? You bet!</desc>

You must choose the appropriate character for each situation the heroes encounter, as they each have a special skill. Blue can swim, Green has a deadly kiss attack, Yellow can bounce high into the air, and Red can use a spin attack to destroy enemies. If you encounter an area the current character is not able to get past, you can switch to another characters with the select button. Learning how and when to use these abilities is key to conquering all 12 levels in the game. So play M&amp;M MINI MADNESS and try to save the factory before the Minis destroy it.</desc>

		<desc>He might spell his name a little strange, but 10-time BMX Vert Champ Mat Hoffman knows his bikes. Lending his expertise to the creation of this game, Hoffman makes sure that every turn, ramp, and flip is up to snuff. Stunt biking has never been more exciting, as you choose from a list of professional BMX riders and see what magic you can make to out-duel the competition. If you can't handle the Vert competition, move on over to Dirt or Street tracks, trying to best your rivals for money and fame. The graphics set the game apart from similar fare, while the gameplay has to represent the most realistic stunt biking possible on the Game Boy Color. Hoffman proves that he knows all there is to know about the up-and-coming sport, providing every last detail of a genuine Vert competition without all of the scrapes, bruises, and breaks. Don't worry, though: if you're looking to get hurt, there's always the agony of defeat.</desc>

Play as a firefighter, police officer, or paramedic in this high-energy challenge based on real-life crises. Whichever hero you choose, you'll receive word of a situation over your radio, hop in your designated vehicle, and navigate your way to the scene of the potential disaster. Of course, there's really no way to know exactly what the scene is going to be when you arrive, so you'd better be on your toes. You might find a robbery in progress, but it might just be two people having an argument, so use your best judgment as to how to handle the situation. Modeled after the Matchbox Emergency Patrol series of die-cast toy vehicles, MATCHBOX EMERGENCY PATROL (the game) is an in-depth adventure revolving around crimes, accidents, and medical emergencies. There are nine different missions for each of the three emergency workers, making it a very diverse game.</desc>

Using the Dark Lord's powerful magic, his evil minions spread famine, plague, and pestilence wherever they went, leaving the peaceful population hopelessly oppressed. All who challenged the wicked Lord were mercilessly slain as a warning to all those who had any further thoughts of rebellion. Then one day while meditating, the great Shogun, Tokugawa, had a divine vision where he saw a small group of mighty warriors rise up to defeat the evil Lord. He immediately set out to recruit the five bravest and most skillful fighters in the land. After months of searching he was finally ready to put his dream into action.

		<name>Metal Walker</name>
		<desc>Although Metal Walker is a console RPG, battles are fought in a pinball or billiards-like atmosphere in a top-down perspective arena. As each turn of the battle starts, players decide which direction a Metal Walker will move and how hard they will move. Players are encouraged to form strategies that allow Metal Walkers to hit a single enemy, bounce off a wall, and then hit another enemy, all in a single turn. On the battlefield, players can throw several different types of items onto the field. The items are used when a Metal Walker hits them. Capsules and healing items strengthen and heal Metal Walkers, whereas attack items, such as Napalm, are only useful when the enemy hits them. There also exist Analyzers, which provide the player with Scan Data for any Metal Walker that is bounced into them. Scrap metal won after the battle can then be used with the Scan Data to create new Metal Walkers or purchase items. When an enemy is destroyed, the player's Metal Walker will gain experience points and an item might be obtained. If the player's Metal Walker runs out of Hit points, the player will lose half of the carried scraps and have to start from the last save point.

Outside of battle, players explore a top-down overworld where they can explore various towns and dungeons. Most battles occur as random encounters. The overworld has several interactable elements, such as water, which the player needs a certain number of Cores to cross. The player can only carry one Metal Walker at a time and it will follow the main character on the overworld. By defeating the game's bosses, players earn Core Units, which allow Metal Walkers to evolve into new, stronger forms.</desc>

Some of the levels had boxing gloves, invincibility potions, safes, crates, flower pots, or ten-pound weights that could be used against the enemies in the game. As a result, the game had a "puzzle-solving" atmosphere.

Players score 100 points for every carrot with the last one in each floor giving the player an extra life, 100 points for every enemy defeated using invincibility bottles, 500 points per enemy using boxing glove and 1000 points per enemy that gets hit with heavy objects.</desc>

Take 15 vehicles including jeeps, helicopters, tanks, speedboats, and sports cars onto 60 different tracks like the breakfast table, the garden, and the pool table. Each track has its own obstacles and hazards, so keep your eyes peeled. For example, watch out for the rubber ducks, soapsuds, and whirlpool drain in the bathtub. The biggest hazard is falling off of the track, which costs time and puts you way behind. As an added bonus, there is a Two-Player mode that can be played on one Game Boy: one player uses direction pad and the other uses the buttons to steer his vehicle left or right, the goal being to push the opposition off of the track. With all of the track and vehicle choices, there is plenty to keep you playing MICRO MACHINES 1 AND 2: Twin Turbo.</desc>

Micro Maniacs is set in a time where the Earth's resources are being depleted and the very planet is at risk. However a scientist named Dr. Minimizer has an idea: using a device he calls "The Minimizer Ray", he will shrink the planet's population to 1/360 of its original size, and so create a world more suitable to our current status. If this is to be successful, the doctor needs to create a supersoldier: somebody who can prepare the planet for us when we are eventually minimized. In order to do this, the doctor enlists the help of 12 volunteers for an experiment. The experiment consists of racetracks that are considered various dangerous environments as to ascertain the suitable skills for the supersoldier.</desc>

		<desc>The programmers at Microsoft are porting a game from their operating system over to the Game Boy Color with MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE. This pinball game was great fun on the PC, and now it is in a form that can be taken anywhere. There are seven different tables that are actually representative of real boards made by pinball giant Gottlieb throughout the last century. Each board carries a different theme, whether it is space travel or a haunted house. The boards also contain a varying number of paddles and paddle locations to make each a different playing experience. The graphics in this version are not as shiny as its computer counterpart, but they do translate well to the small color screen. The sound effects and music remain largely the same, adding to the game's arcade feel. The cartridge also contains a short but detailed history of pinball and how it has evolved over the years. MICROSOFT PINBALL ARCADE gives players the classic game with enough boards and extras to keep even the experts busy for quite a while.</desc>

The journey is a difficult one though, because the castle is locked up tight and Milon doesn't have the keys. You will have to use your bubble attacks to fend off the castle baddies while busting up every block in sight trying to find all of the hidden treasure and other secrets throughout the game. Unlike most platformers, Milon's Secret Castle is less about defeating all of the enemies in an area, and more about scouring every bit of each room to find the secrets that lie within Garland Castle! Milo can uncover practically anything in the game. This includes: items, power-ups, money, shields, keys, level exits, even shops! The only way to get to each level boss is to find the right secret items!</desc>

The concept of the game is simple: missiles come from the top of the screen, and you are trying to defend the six buildings in the city below. Your goal is to target the missiles and fire your defensive weaponry; if the cloud from your weapon touches the missile, it is destroyed. However, you only have a limited number of shots, and if all sections of the city are destroyed, it's Game Over. After successfully defending a city from two waves of missiles, you will be treated to a special animation that is related to the city. If your friends want to get in on the action, there is an alternating Two-Player mode. Try to defend the world's cities from destruction in MISSILE COMMAND.</desc>

Many years have passed since then and God entrusted the humans with the secret of "disc stones". Today people still continue searching for these missing "disc stones" to unlock the lifeforms within. In the anime, the monsters were created by scientists.
It is said that the "disc stones" are almost impossible to find among the ancient ruins. It is said that one monster is trapped inside each one. One day a group of workers excavating the ancient ruins happened to dig up one of these mythical disc stones. The worker who first discovered a disc stone took the disc to the Monsters' Temple. There the priests, using the ancient methods, unlocked the monster inside the disc stone. In a place where ranchers and monsters coexisted peacefully, the battle of the monsters began. As time passed these monster battles became extremely popular, and monster breeding became the standard pastime of the land. Eventually disc stones were found around the entire world.

		<name>Midway Presents Arcade Hits: Moon Patrol / Spy Hunter</name>
		<desc>Look no further than ARCADE HITS: Moon Patrol &amp; Spy Hunter for classic fun on the run for Game Boy and Game Boy Color. Featuring two classic arcade action titles, ARCADE HITS is packed full of fun. In SPY HUNTER, you play a super spy trying to thwart the nefarious plots of your adversaries. Take to the road in your souped-up roadster in a thrilling overhead chase. Collect power-ups to increase your firepower, oil slicks to give the baddies the slip, and more. Take out as many of the enemies as you can, but watch out for civilians or you'll have some explaining to do! MOON PATROL takes you to the surface of the Moon, driving a fully armed dune buggy in side-scrolling mayhem. Blast away at the Moon critters that are out to get you, and keep an eye out for craters! Both games are perfect graphical reproductions of the vintage arcade machines. Classic and modern gamers can't go wrong with this awesome duo of games!</desc>

		<name>Moorhen 3 - The Chicken Chase!</name>
		<desc>This really couldn't be any simpler; Moorhen features no complicated gameplay whatsoever. You just shoot things. The real skill though is in knowing just what to shoot and when to shoot it and where some targets reap sizeable rewards others will drain your score in no time at all. One addition to version three is the introduction of protected birds flying around with your intended targets which means that shooting now takes a little more thought than simply blasting into the sky. Other features remain intact and there are still items that need to be avoided such as balloons and various animals on the ground. As usual though you'll need to experiment to find out just what's worth hitting and what's not.

One of the best parts of the Moorhen series has been the hidden bonuses and secrets but they've always been well concealed and you're more likely to discover them by accident rather than actually work them out. I won't spoil some of the goodies we've discovered in this version but Moorhuhn 2 featured spiders that could be spun around trees and the first edition had you shaking trees then shooting down ten leaves for a 100 point bonus. Finally the hi-score chart is still there as is the wonderful battery back up so you can prove that you did actually get a score over 50.</desc>

		<desc>All of the action and fun of the first feminist arcade game can be put in the palm of your hand with MS. PAC-MAN: Special Color Edition. You take control of the yellow disk adorned with lipstick and a pink bow, better known as the lovely Ms. Pac-Man. The goal is to guide her around the maze and eat all of the dots, avoiding the four ghosts that chase you. There are power pellets located in each corner of the maze which, when eaten, turn the ghosts blue. Once this happens, the ghosts can be eaten. Occasionally, fruit will float into the maze, which can be munched for extra points. If your friends want to play along, there is an alternating Two-Player mode. As an additional bonus, a complete version of SUPER PAC-MAN is included on the cartridge. Play as the first female arcade hero in MS. PAC-MAN: Special Color Edition.</desc>

Shaquille O'Neal takes the spotlight in this one, but there are plenty of other NBA stars to play as (though some need to be unlocked by winning games). Choose which players you want to play on your NBA franchise, then jump it up and see who's the best. Other than the regular gameplay, you can try your hand at 2-Ball, Around the World, Twenty-One, and the Three-Pont Shootout.</desc>

The game is played seven-on-seven, and it takes 30-yards to get a first down. But probably the most important rule change is that there are no penalties. When you start the game, you have the choice of playing in the Arcade or Season mode. Arcade has you pick a team and try to defeat all of the other teams in the league, while in the Season mode, you take your team through the grueling NFL season in hopes of making the playoffs and winning the Super Bowl. No matter how you play the game, you will not miss a second of the action, thanks to three different camera angles. Try to keep your helmet on while playing NFL BLITZ 2000.</desc>

NFL Football puts the pressure on your shoulder pads to carry both the pro-style offense and defense.
When driving for the end zone, you'll call every shot, firing bullets and bombs to your favorite receivers. Or run bootlegs, blasting upfield behind snarling, thick-necked blockers.

First downs, four quarters, kickoffs, punts, field goals, extra points, stats...everything's here but the bruises. You can even star on your favorite NFL franchise, since al 28 teams are here, ready to replay their rowdy rivalries.
So pull down your face mask, tape your fingers, and grind it out on this Game Boy game breaker.</desc>

Choose one of six awesome characters to take through to the game's conclusion, and enjoy creative side games like Frisbee Toss and Capture the Flag. The top-notch graphics and gameplay of ULTIMATE SURFING will have you feeling the ocean's breeze splashing across your face, and the controls are simple to learn but sophisticated enough to appeal to the most discerning handheld gamers. As if all of this weren't a sweet enough deal, you can link up with another player and surf against one another. Now, that's one gnarly game, dude.</desc>

It seem that a nefarious real estate agent has designs on turning the family mansion into a high-rent amusement park, and the only way the Addams family can save their old haunt (no pun intended) is to win a court battle. Since courtroom dramas don't make for good video games, the object here is to help the well-meaning Addams clan locate the original ownership papers for the house in order to prove that the land is rightfully theirs. You'll be able to explore 30 massive levels of spooky territory making your way through the mansion, the high court, town hall, a greenhouse, a mineshaft, city streets, and more.

		<path>./O'Leary Manager 2000 (E) (M7) [C][!].zip</path>
		<name>O'Leary Manager 2000</name>
		<desc>O'Leary Manager 2000 is a football player-manager game released in 2000 for the Game Boy Color. The player can choose whether they want to focus on the management side of football, play the matches themselves on the game's 2D match engine, or combine the two features for a more in-depth experience. It is endorsed by Irish football manager David O'Leary, who was managing Leeds United A.F.C. at the time of the game's release.

The management side of O'Leary Manager 2000 is very comprehensive when compared to similar Game Boy Color games. The player can choose from 240 fully licensed teams from the top two leagues in England, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands to play as or manage, with each team having 16 players in their squad. There is also the option to promote a number of fictional youth team players. However, most of the youth team players are of low ability, so could only realistically be used for back-up when managing a decent quality team.

As with any football management game, the transfer market can often play a key role in whether the team achieves success. The player's selected team starts with either 10.5m or 5.5m to spend, depending on whether they were in the first or second tier of their country's football hierarchy. The player can also recoup some money by selling players to other teams. This is done by first offering the footballer for sale at a chosen price, from which interested clubs would then place offers that the player could choose to accept or not. Once a price is agreed, the footballer transfers clubs instantly. The values of footballers alternate greatly during the game, with the then Real Betis striker Denílson being the most expensive player at the start of the game. An unfortunate bug in the game allows the player to gain a huge sum of money (around 70m) if the club goes into a certain amount of debt, which pretty much negates the need for financial planning.

The club's board of directors constantly give assessments as to how they think the club is progressing under your management. This involves a short statement visible at the menu screen. Other features available the menu screen include options to change you team line-up, formation and tactics; all vital when creating a successful team.

Similarly, you can decide what methods of training your team will undertake for the coming week. You have the option to "do training", which generally increase the statistics of your players (but at the risk of injuring them) or to concentrate on fitness training (which helps players stay fit and injured players to recover quicker). Alternatively, you may choose to skip training entirely for the week. You also have the option to view various statistics, such as league tables from around the world, top goalscorers and to view the squads of all available teams on the game.</desc>

Choose from seven different brawlers Vandal, Aska, Ruoh, Shades, Miyabi, Tao, and Bulk as you take it to the competition and show em who's boss. There are four different tournament styles to play in, making for intensely high replay value and variety. Each of the seven fighters brandishes a few special moves that are all their own, making for original fights every time out. Of course, there are the requisite punches and kicks, but mastering your own fighter's combos will lead you to easier victory. Play against the computer, or hook up with a friend via a link cable and scrap it out for bragging rights.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Attack</name>
		<desc>Based on Namco's Japanese-only arcade puzzler Cosmo Gang the Puzzle, Pac-Attack is similar to many block-dropping puzzle games from the time, such as Puyo Puyo.

The objective of the game is to place ghosts and then, after three pieces (which can include one or two blocks as well), make Pac-Man eat as many ghosts as possible to try and clear up the game area. Pac-Man's directions are chosen at random between left or right, but as he goes moving on the game area (after you place him, of course), if he bumps against a block or a "wall" on the game area, he will change his direction. As with many block-dropping puzzlers, if a line of blocks and/or ghosts reaches the top, the game ends. However, by filling up a meter on the left of the game area, a fairy may appear that can clear approximately 6 or 7 lines with ghosts, but it only clears the ghosts, although the blocks that were on top of them will drop.

The game also includes a Puzzle mode. It features 100 levels, in which you have to eat all ghosts with no more than 4 Pac-Men at least (the number reduces in certain levels), and, unlike the other modes, you can change Pac-Man's direction with the press of a button.</desc>

		<name>Pac-Man: Special Color Edition</name>
		<desc>One of the most popular and influential games of the 1980's, Pac-Man stars a little, yellow dot-muncher who works his way around to clear a maze of the various dots and fruit which inhabit the board.

Pac-Man's goal is continually challenged by four ghosts: The shy blue ghost Bashful (Inky), the trailing red ghost Shadow (Blinky), the fast pink ghost Speedy (Pinky), and the forgetful orange ghost Pokey (Clyde). One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Pac-Man.

Pac-Man can turn the tables on his pursuers by eating of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points. This only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Pac-Man again.

Survive a few rounds of gameplay, and be treated to humorous intermissions between Pac-Man and the ghosts.</desc>

		<desc>Released in conjunction with the 2001 cinematic remake, PLANET OF THE APES, the game actually takes its plot from the 1968 original film. Play as Ulysses (the character that Charlton Heston originated), a human who has fallen to a post-apocalyptic Earth ruled by primates. Ulysses quickly discovers that he is being considered a sort of messiah by many of the apes (he's considered an enemy by others), and it is becoming readily apparent that the creatures want him to save them from the dangers of this new world. The game is packed with puzzles to solve, and the graphics are among the best ever created for the Game Boy Color. Modes of play include: Normal, in which Ulysses walks from location to location; Athletic, in which the hero runs and jumps through each level of the story; and Stealth, which requires Ulysses to crawl and slink into hidden areas not accessible in other modes. It's not easy to compare PLANET OF THE APES to any other video game, and that's really its charm.</desc>

		<name>Play Action Football</name>
		<desc>Nintendo takes its game to the gridiron with NES Play Action Football. While Nintendo did not get the NFL license for this one, it did secure the license of the NFL Player's Association, so the 8 teams to choose from (all named after the appropriate NFL cities) are all stocked up with real pro players from the 1989 season. You can even substitute second-stringers for the "skill" positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, and FS/SS) when your starters get tired.

Play perspective is very unusual: top-down slightly modified with a three-quarters tilt behind the offense, and the scrolling is diagonal, from the bottom left to upper right of the screen. Each team has 12 passing and 12 running plays on offense, and the option to reverse play designs effectively gives you a total of 48 potential plays to run. The defense has 8 cover plays and 8 blitzes to select from. The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.

Games are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters. There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout "First Down!" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains. Team stats are displayed on a summary screen after every quarter of play. Highest scoring team wins, which in playoffs mode means moving on to the next round--and an eventual shot at winning it all in the Power Bowl!</desc>

		<desc>Pocket Monster mania continues with Nintendo's release of Pokémon Crystal for the Game Boy Color. Much as 1999's Pokémon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, Pokémon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver releases.

Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokémon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokémon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokémon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokémon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch 'em all.</desc>

		<name>Pokémon Pinball</name>
		<desc>There are two tables in the game, red and blue. Each table has its own details and gameplay elements.

Each table has different "locations" that you play, which determine which Pokémon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select your starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game.

"Catch Mode," when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you can attempt to capture a Pokémon. Once you activate "catch mode," you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokémon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokémon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.

"Evolution Mode," when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokémon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokémon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokémon.</desc>

The name of this game comes from an English pun, as "tsuu" (通 tsū, meaning "Expert") when spoken aloud sounds similar to the English word "two".
Just like the prequel, Puyo fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise by 90°; if the third column from the left fills up to the top, the game is over. Different rules however played a factor within the game. The game also has different styles of playing for each version, including its newer features.</desc>

		<desc>Pocket Monster mania continues with Nintendo's release of Pokémon Crystal for the Game Boy Color. Much as 1999's Pokémon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, Pokémon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver releases.

Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokémon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokémon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokémon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokémon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch 'em all.</desc>

		<name>Pokémon Crystal Version</name>
		<desc>Pocket Monster mania continues with Nintendo's release of Pokémon Crystal for the Game Boy Color. Much as 1999's Pokémon Yellow offered gentle enhancements to the basic story and gameplay of the original Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue games, Pokémon Crystal is based on the second-wave Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver releases.

Though it follows the same story told in the Gold and Silver versions, Pokémon Crystal has some new options and special features. For the first time, gamers have the choice to play as a female trainer in this version. Also, just as Pokémon Yellow included a special Pikachu, trainers are aided by an unusual Suicune in this release. Pokémon Crystal is designed to offer a complete Pokémon experience for those new to the ubiquitous phenomenon and additional challenges for seasoned trainers who simply have to catch 'em all.</desc>

		<desc>There are two tables in the game, red and blue. Each table has its own details and gameplay elements.

Each table has different "locations" that you play, which determine which Pokémon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select your starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game.

"Catch Mode," when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you can attempt to capture a Pokémon. Once you activate "catch mode," you must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokémon currently up for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokémon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to capture it.

"Evolution Mode," when activated, starts a 2 minute window of opportunity where you select a captured Pokémon (from the current game in progress only) and attempt to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to your Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, you must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 6 targets, but only 3 of them have items in them you need to evolve a Pokémon. The others create a time-wasting sequence before you can hit targets again. If you hit a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once you've collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokémon.</desc>

That's the game in a nutshell, but there are several modes of play that'll keep your fingers busy.

Players move a paddle up and down, trying to hit the ball past their opponent, and the first player to get 11 points wins. In addition to the classic Pong, there are three other tables to play on. On the Glacier level, two penguins waddle around between the paddles and affect the trajectory of the ball when it hits them. In the Soccer level, players must maneuver two paddles to try to put the ball into the opponent's net. Finally, the Jungle stage has two rollers in the middle that can change the ball's trajectory.

In fact, the duo will need to find dozens of pots full of the stuff, and that will mean searching the entire forest. Much to Pooh and Tigger's collective dismay, the area is populated by dozens of insects, angry animals, and environmental dangers. In addition to searching for the hunny, you'll have to help your pals find such popular characters as Rabbit, Piglet, and Owl, as well as unlocking dozens of hidden areas and special power-ups. Three mini-games Veggy Match, River Run, and Fence Off can also be uncovered, and you can save all of your progress and resume play with a password. The game spans 18 levels and five diverse environments including The Spring Glade, The Nighttime Forest, Autumn Heights, Creepy Caves, and Winter Wood.</desc>

		<name>Popeye</name>
		<desc>This game was released only in Japan.
The scenario is a maze and the player controls Popeye who has a time limit to collect some hearts, find Olive Oyl and save Swee'Pea which only appears somewhere to be saved after the hearts were collected and Olive found.
Popeye should avoid Bluto in order to prevent a fight with him, not losing time. When the fight is inevitable, and if Olive is already found, Popeye will lose her, and after the fight ends, he has to find her again. Bluto can drop weapons and enemies such as cannons and animals. He also steals the hearts and when it happens the heart will appear somewhere else to be collected. J. Wellington Wimpy is always wandering around and puts hamburgers that eventually block Popeye's path, however he can put so much as remove by eating them. A "flying" can of spinach will sometimes appear during the game anytime and out of nowhere, and can be used to increase Popeye's strength: be faster and the ability to eliminate enemies released by Bluto and Wimpy's hamburgers that obstruct the path. There are three playable courses and each one has five stages. In the game ending, Popeye gets married to Olive Oyl in front of a church.
Bluto is a playable character in the multiplayer-mode.</desc>

Though you begin as a pint-sized plaything, you can eventually travel to worlds that are of an accommodating size over seven different locations. Each world contains numerous levels, resulting in 43 scenarios overall. Throughout your journey you'll come across swamps, dungeons, and even intergalactic spaceships. Each level progresses like typical a side-scrolling game, with plenty of action and adventure awaiting you. Some environments offer different weapons and enemies, and you'll even get the opportunity to commandeer a vehicle on some levels. For those with a penchant for exploration, there are even some hidden worlds to discover that offer even more amazing discoveries and challenges. Progress can be saved using a password system based on which levels have already been conquered. PORTAL RUNNER is a graphically impressive game for a portable system and it promises hours of gameplay, harrowing challenges, and an exciting story to follow.</desc>

You venture around the town in which you live on an overworld map where you can go to different locations. Once you arrive at a location, a character appears on the screen with some dialogue. More often than not this dialog involves the character challenging you to a fight. After you are challenged by a character, the game switches to a one-on-one fighting game engine. This is the RPG's battle system which differs from the usual turn-based battle engine's of the genre.
You can buy new parts for your Model which is how you gain experience throughout the game. You progress through the game by challenging a certain amount of people before the next event is triggered. Then special events pop up throughout the game after this number is met which usually involve a tournament or beating some strong boss-type character.</desc>

There are items you can collect along the way, but there are also hazards and obstacles designed to mess with your progress. There are only two game modes, one on a regular course with no items (sort of like a survival mode), and a special mode where there are items and obstacles to face. You can also play in the special mode against a second human player. It can be fun, albeit tough to put down, so give it a try!</desc>

Bubbles' nurturing personality shines in the video game, as you help her collect power-ups and battle the infamous, evil "Him." She might be an elementary school student, but she'll prove just how dedicated she is to crime fighting, as you help Bubbles shoot her way through level after level of original action. Many of the items that you collect throughout the adventure can be traded for others via friends playing the other POWERPUFF GIRLS games on their systems. Although it's a one-player game, the trading aspect gives the experience a significantly interactive element. Of course, the brilliant sense of humor from the cartoon series is present throughout the adventure, as are all of the other characters you've come to love.

You'd better be in top form as you command a killer spacecraft out into orbit in hopes of rescuing humanity from unthinkable misery. Each of the eight stages in PROJECT S-11 poses unique challenges, and each setting is more harrowing than the last. Although you're going it alone in this one, there are four different types of power-ups hidden throughout the game to give the boost you'll need to survive and wipe out the terrifying extra-terrestrials. You'll benefit from a complete statistical readout that adorns the right side of your screen, keeping you abreast of all necessary information: your score, your ship's armor level, and the number of bombs you have stored up for combat. The game's fast-paced action looks excellent in full color, and the intensity of it will have you breaking a sweat before you're through the first level.

		<name>Puchi Carat</name>
		<desc>A mix between classic "Walls" and "Bubbles" puzzles games
12 characters to challenge
12 gems to win
Intense competitions
4 amazing game modes

The general objective of Puchi Carat is to destroy gem-like blocks using a ball and paddle. Gems "fall in" from the top of the play area one line at a time and are connected to each other either horizontally or vertically. Hitting a gem with the ball will destroy it, and if the destroyed gem causes other gems to no longer be connected to the top of the play area, they fall off, scoring bonus points. Destroying a special flashing gem also destroys all regular gems of the same color in the playfield. There are also metallic blocks that take more than one hit to destroy.

The player controls a paddle at the bottom of the playfield, which can move left and right to bounce the ball back upward. Unlike in most other Breakout-style games, missing the ball does not cost a life or end the game, but rather adds more lines of gems to the top of the playfield. Gem lines will advance on their own after a certain amount of time, as well as when the playfield is cleared entirely or drops below a certain number of gems. If the gems advance across the line at the bottom of the playfield where the paddle resides, the player loses and the game is over.

The arcade version of Puchi Carat features three main gameplay modes: A single-player mode where the goal is to clear a certain number of gem lines, a story mode in which the player challenges each character in a head-to-head battle (where dropped gems are added to the opponent's playfield from the bottom), and a two-player versus mode following the same rules as the story mode. Each of the single-player modes offers three levels of difficulty. Various ports of the game offer additional gameplay modes (such as time-attack mode), more difficulty levels, and expanded storylines for each character.</desc>

The game features four different modes of play: Beginners Mode in which the basics are explained and the player receives hints on how to solve each level; Practice Mode that lets the player choose the size of the levels which are then randomly picked; Puzzle Mode in which the player has to complete 40 levels and receives a score depending on the time it took him to complete a level; and finally Action Mode, which is basically a story mode containing two stories. The game also features a password system and four different difficulty levels.</desc>

		<desc>The Goblin King has corrupted the elements and is flooding the world, and it's up to you to save it. Groups of four elements fire, water, stone, and wood fall from the sky. You must position the elements in such a way that three of the same type touch each other, and are thus eliminated. However, there are some complicating factors: monsters will appear on the play field and will throw pollution blocks that cannot be removed. Further, each round has some tasks which range from watering a flowerpot to triggering a drawbridge that will eliminate several rows which need to be completed.</desc>

		<desc>The game is essentially a series of 36 jigsaw puzzles with Tetris-like pieces known as pentominos that must be assembled into a specific shape. The puzzles start off with rectangular shapes and simple solutions, but the puzzles quickly grow more complex, with odder shapes like a rocket ship, a gun, and even enlarged versions of some of the pentominoes themselves. Each level is timed, and once the timer is started it cannot be stopped until the level is finished. One starts off the game with only three pentomino pieces, and at the completion of each early level, a new piece is awarded to the player. At the final level, the player is given the 2x2 square O tetromino and must complete an 8x8 square puzzle.

After completing each level, the player was given a password to access that level at a later time. Interestingly, each password was a common English four-letter word, so that by guessing common four-letter words, players could potentially access levels they had not actually reached by playing the game.</desc>

It seems that a maniacal scientist has transported you to a distant dimension. The only way to return to your rightful place is to solve dozens and dozens of puzzles--each of which will get you one step closer to escaping imprisonment and saving the world. Each unique mindbender uses tiles with varied symbols, charging you with the task of eliminating them, rearranging them, or otherwise manipulating them. The color graphics and cool sound effects only add to the charm of this great blend of puzzles and plot. Because PUZZLED has so many different challenges, the game takes hours to tackle, and the replay value is high. If you think you've got what it takes to crack a mountain of crazy puzzles and save the world, then you're just the hero the planet has been waiting for.</desc>

		<desc>The arcade hit Q*BERT comes to the Game Boy Color. The player takes control of an orange creature that hops around a course built of blocks. The goal is to change all of the blocks to the appropriate color by hopping on them. As the game progresses, blocks will require multiple jumps. Complicating the process, a snake that wants to destroy you hops around the course, and there are two balls that go down parts of the course undoing all of your work. There are more than 40 levels to complete with several that are larger than one screen. Since all of the action in the game moves in diagonals, there are two different control schemes to maximize your fun. If you remember playing Q*BERT at the arcade, you will enjoy being able to play it in the palm of your hand.</desc>

Based on the coin-operated classic, QIX, this GBC sequel to the puzzle-based original offers similar gaming styles and a few welcome updates. In this take, you'll use a cursor to draw boxes on the screen, avoiding the Qix. If you can draw a compete box without the Qix touching its perimeter, that area of the screen will disappear and get you one step closer to advancing. Adding an element of story, QIX ADVENTURE casts you in the role of Speedy, a treasure hunter who's traveled to a mysterious island. Each level that you pass will help you in your quest to rid the island of all its strange creatures. Easy to learn but extremely difficult to master, QIX ADVENTURE is addicting fun for puzzle lovers and other gamers. Are you quick enough for Qix? Find out alone or against a friend.</desc>

		<name>R-Type II</name>
		<desc>The game is the sequel to R-Type, which was first released as an arcade game in 1987 and profoundly influenced later shooting games with its charge shots, unique weaponry, and grotesque enemies. Hudson Soft ported the later 4 levels of the original R-Type to the TurboGrafx-16 with the title R-Type II, but the Hudson release is unrelated to the game described in this article.

The player controls a ship called the R-9C (or R-9 Custom), which is an improved version of its predecessor game's ship; the R-9. The ship's design was changed slightly, and the wave cannon was given homing capabilities. Two new types of weapons (the Search Laser and Shotgun Laser) were added, bringing the total number of weapon types up to five. A new anti-ground unit bomb was also added to the missile inventory.

Though the number of levels was decreased from the prequel, the number of enemies, their durability, and the number of bullets they shoot were greatly increased. Enemy movements and terrain were also made trickier, bringing the game's difficulty up considerably. The same revival system is used as in the prequel, where the player is brought back to a checkpoint whenever their ship is destroyed.</desc>

		<desc>Purebred destruction is the name of the game in RAMPAGE WORLD TOUR. Choose one of three different monsters (each a gargantuan tower of rage), and then join your counterparts as you wreak holy terror on city after city. You'll stomp buildings, crush cars, and even take down innocent pedestrians in your strides to do as much damage as possible. Parents can rest assured: although the game's focus is on tearing apart the scenery, there's little of the blood and gore that pervades many video games these days. There are more than 130 stages to romp through in this tribute to silver screen terrors, and each level presents all-new challenges and more difficult gameplay. If you're familiar with the RAMPAGE series, you'll love the inclusion of three new monsters to take the place of the familiar faces from the original game. The play is faithful to previous titles in the RAMPAGE series, but improved graphics and controls make for the most exhilarating entry to date. Devastation has never been so fun!</desc>

There are five mini-games to play; some are versions of classic kid's games, but with a fire theme. One is simple game MEMORY where players must match pictures of animals to rescue them from a fire, while another is similar to SIMON where players must memorize and repeat color combinations. Some of the other games are more action oriented and will challenge anyone's skill. For example, one game calls for the player to ride a jet ski to rescue people stuck on the other side of a river and drop buckets of water from a helicopter. If you have a Game Boy printer, the medals and awards earned can be printed. Now you can help a young gamer get started with RESCUE HEROES: Fire Frenzy.</desc>

		<desc>A mystical force known as Gaia permeates every aspect of the planet. Those who are aware of the force can manipulate it to do their bidding.

Along the way, you will encounter new friends that will aid you in the quest. Ultimately, you will encounter monsters, and if you're lucky, you'll be able to convince the monsters to join you. When a monster has joined the party, it can be summoned to help in battle. While the monster will not gain experience, it can be combined with other creatures to create a more powerful monster.

		<desc>It's amazing what some animals will do just to get a drink of water. Take Rocky the Rhino, for instance: Positively parched (he ate way too many peppers at a local jungle party), the little fellow is willing to traverse 19 enormous levels in the hope of quenching his mighty thirst. Help the adorable Rocky get through seven unique worlds, fending off all who would stand in his way. Many of the jungle's inhabitants are convinced that Rocky will drink up the water supply, you see, so they're all working against you from the outset. Make your way through forests and caves, using unique artillery like fireball breath and belly jumps to squelch the attempts of your foes and get to the magical spring. In addition to your weaponry, you'll have the assistance of various boats, planes, trampolines, and wagons to reach the end of each level.</desc>

You must race 15 other competitors to the finish line, but there's a catch: your opponents are equipped with weapons including chains, clubs, and pipes, and they have no problems using them on you when you get too close. Luckily, you can kick to get rid of these guys, or you just might be able to catch one and steal his weapon. Keep in mind, though, that the cops are patrolling and will not hesitate to pull you over. By placing in the top three of any race, you will be awarded some cash to spend on new bike parts or a whole new motorcycle. If your friends want to join the brutal action, they can with the Link Cable mode. Are you tough enough to take out the competition in ROAD RASH?</desc>

		<name>Robot Wars: Metal Mayhem</name>
		<desc>Robot Wars: Metal Mayhem is the first video game based on the British game show Robot Wars. It was released exclusively for Game Boy Color on 7 December 2000.[1] It was the first of four games based on the show, with the first three selling over 250,000 copies.[2] The game was based on the third series of the show, and competitors such as its champion Chaos 2 feature in the game.

In the game, a competitor robot from the series, or a robot created by the player, is entered into combat against a robot controlled by the game. A bout finishes when one robot's health bar is fully depleted. In the Tournament Mode, the first robot to win two bouts advances. The game features the arena obstacles and House Robots of the series, and in other modes, a selection of mini-games based on the show's side events.</desc>

		<name>RodLand</name>
		<desc>The player(s) control one or two fairies called Tam and Rit armed with a magic wand (rod). Following the concept of Taito's Bubble Bobble, the rod doesn't kill the monsters directly, but only leaves them immobilized, crying. To kill them, the rod can grasp them in a magic force-field and the player can smash them down over her head until they disappear and leave a power-up behind.

Each level is only one small screen composed of monsters, platforms, ladders and, later, tunnels. Unlike other games of the genre, the players can never jump, but have to use ladders. They can conjure one custom ladder above or below them in order to go to the appropriate platform. There can be only one such 'custom' ladder; therefore if the fairy summons it again, it will disappear from its previous position in order to appear again next to the fairy. This can be beneficial for the player, if a monster is climbing that ladder to approach her.

The fairies' quest is to rescue their mother, trapped in a tower. In the sequel (part of the original arcade machine) they must venture into a pyramid, to stop an evil force that is building a mobile fortress. The spirit of their departed father "guides" them at a couple of points. The ending implies that the evil in the pyramid was somehow responsible for their father's death.</desc>

		<name>Roland Garros 2000</name>
		<desc>Roland Garros French Open is the only appearance of the franchise on the Game Boy Color. Less of a serious simulation of tennis than other versions, the handheld edition features cartoony 2D graphics and outrageous court locations.

All-in-all, the game includes eight different players and twelve different tournaments. Only five players and four tournaments can be selected from the start, the others are unlocked by winning events. The starting tournaments are realistic grand slam events: the Roland Garros French Open (the only one with a license), the English Open (i.e. Wimbledon), the US Championship and the Australian Cup, on clay, grass or turf. Winning them unlocks the more unusual locations: from street and beach tournaments to far-out events in the Antarctic or on the moon.

All events are single elimination, starting at the quarter finals. Matches follow original rules, and are seen from a standard perspective behind the controlled player. All characters (players, officials and fans) are drawn in a cartoony style with oversized heads. The controls allow for a variety of moves including backhand and forehand shots, volleys and lobs.</desc>

MARIO comes this white-knuckle test of your reflexes. Replacing the usual bunch of plummeting shapes with six-sided dice, ROX adds an element of dominoes into the mix. Your real moment-to-moment challenge is to match one die with another, using the pair to eliminate the dice that lie in between the two.</desc>

		<desc>The Rugrats are about to find out that the only thing more exciting than traveling through your own backyard is traveling through time. After discovering a time machine, the kids accidentally scatter themselves throughout history, and you're the only one who can reunite the famous babies with their beloved cohorts. Each of the game's 12 levels puts you in charge of a different character, charging you with tasks like finding a lost toy, locating fellow Rugrats, or tracking down mysterious items. The whole debacle begins when Chuckie won't enter the time machine with the other babies, but he changes his mind as soon as the rest if the gang disappears and leaves him all alone. Chuckie's attempt to track down the others puts him in the 1800s, but none of his friends are there. In fact, Tommy is in ancient Egypt, Angelica is at an old circus, Phil is trapped in prehistory, and Dil is, somehow, lost in space! Can you collect all of the lost items and round up the babies before it's too late?</desc>

The player chooses between using either a helicopter or a jeep at the beginning of the game and then plays in their chosen vehicles through scrolling levels, shooting at oncoming enemies. Certain enemies when shot drop shield power-ups which can be either picked up to afford temporarily invincibility or detonated to destroy all enemies onscreen. Every so often a boss enemy will attack. The destruction of these bosses will give upgrades to the player's forward firing gun.</desc>

		<desc>Jinkies! Join up with the entire gang of meddling kids (Shaggy, Scooby, Fred, Daphne, and Velma) as you try to crack three separate mysteries each based on classic episodes of the beloved cartoon program. Taking the TV episodes "What a Night for a Knight," "That's Snow Ghost," and "A Tiki Scare is No Fair," the game runs the three stories together with a unifying plotline. You play as Shaggy, trudging through haunted forests, creepy basements, and abandoned buildings with your trusty pal, Scoob. Rather than having a "death" meter, as in most games of its kind, SCOOBY-DOO: Classic Creep Capers has a courage meter Scoob and Shag flee the scene if they get too scared. There are plenty of clues hidden throughout the game's expansive levels, but if you're not careful the bad guys might get to you before you can solve the mysteries. While the game certainly offers something for nostalgic fans of the series, it's a hilarious, original take that will keep gamers challenged as well.</desc>

		<desc>What do you say? It’s Scrabble, right? True, but not as we know it. Ubi Soft has finally reproduced one of the world’s most popular board games for the handheld gaming community. Yes, this is Scrabble for Game Boy Color. 

Visually, there’s really not much to say about this Game Boy Color version. The game consists of a series of white tiles each with their own letter and value. Is that enough for you? Oh yes. You know Scrabble. Seven random letters, make a word out of 'em, score points. Fall out with opponent optional. 

Seven lettered tiles it is then, with which you must formulate the highest scoring word possible. Clearly, letters such as Q, X and Z have a greater value, but the number of legitimate words that use these letters is limited. Once you’ve chosen your word, you must place it on a board in a horizontal or vertical fashion. Certain spaces on the board contain score boosters that will increase the value of your chosen word. Triple Word Score is particularly useful. Your letter supply will then be replenished and you must repeat the process once your opponent has placed his word on the board. At the end of the game, when the supply of tiles is exhausted, the highest scoring player wins. 

So there you have it. It’s Scrabble on a handheld, and it’s brilliant.</desc>

		<desc>The wackiest computer-animated film of all time has its own classic hand-held game! Boasting fast-paced thrills and the most hilarious characters ever portrayed in a video game, SHREK: Fairy Tales Freakdown turns the story of the movie into a fighting game that players of all ages will love. Taking six familiar faces from the popular film, Fairy Tales Freakdown pits the unlikely combatants in a series of battles against one another each fight taking place in a classic SHREK environment. Solid gameplay will earn you the right to play as one of three locked characters, and each brawler is characterized by a unique (and highly comical) fighting style. The mostly non-violent fighting closely mirrors the humor of the film, resulting in some truly memorable melees. Using animations that are straight from the film, the game delivers the look and feel that made SHREK so successful. Play alone or take on a friend in this lighthearted, tournament-style fighting game.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons: Bart vs. the Juggernauts</name>
		<desc>Bart Simpson here, on my way to the Springfield Arena to do battle with the Juggernauts, my all-time TV heroes.

It isn't going to be easy. There's nobody tougher than the Juggernauts (except maybe yours truly), but I'll be fighting 'em out on my own turf: Krustyland Amusement Park, Moe's Tavern, and the Nuclear Power Plant, just to name a few.

No one knows this, but I've got a whole new set of cool manoeuvres AND a new technological edge - I can CHEAT!

I'm psyched. I'm ready to rock and roll. On to victory, Man!

Your pal, Bart Simpson.</desc>

		<name>The Simpsons: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror</name>
		<desc>Halloween becomes a year-round treat with THE SIMPSONS: Night of the Living Treehouse of Horror. Based on the annual SIMPSONS Halloween specials, this lighthearted game allows you to play as anyone in the family: Bart, Lisa, Homer, Marge, or little Maggie. Each character has been drawn into a haunted world, and it's up to you to steer them home. There are six spooky levels in all, and each one of them is packed with chills and challenges for gamers of all ages. SIMPSONS aficionados are sure to get a kick out of all the cameos Principal Skinner, Krusty the Clown, Moe the Bartender, Barney, and plenty of others make appearances. The game successfully marries the hilarious antics of the Springfield regulars with some surprisingly exciting gameplay to yield a game that's as much fun to play as a SIMPSONS episode is to watch. You don't have to be a total series addict to get into this rollicking gem.</desc>

Rather than sending out a fleet of space destroyers or loads of nuclear warheads, it is determined that Earth's best chance of wiping out these creatures is (drum roll, please) you! As Space Marauder, it is your job to avoid waves of space beings careening through the outer reaches of the galaxy. You are aiding only by a jet pack and a laser gun. Sound tough? It is. Assorted power-ups are strewn about to help you in your plight, but the best asset you'll have is your itchy trigger finger and taste for alien blood. Lots of powerful bosses wait at the end of each of the game's levels, and every stage presents new and increasingly difficult challenges for our hero. Boasting a cool soundtrack and smooth controls, there's plenty of gameplay to keep your fingers moving for hours on end.</desc>

		<desc>Space Station Silicon Valley is a based on the Nintendo 64 game of the same name. It keeps story, gameplay mechanics and even the basic level design while translating everything into a platforming perspective shown from the side. 

The story is about a space station which is populated by independent robot animals. A while ago the station vanished but now it is back on full collision course towards Earth. Of course humanity sends squads out there to end the threat, but everyone but the robot Evo gets lost. The player takes the role of Evo who has to solve 35 levels in order to save Earth.

The unique characteristic of the game is that Evo has the ability to take control over any robot animal he meets. In fact, he is required to do so because his life energy rapidly decreases when outside of a host. All those animals have different abilities which are used to solve the numerous puzzles found in the levels. There are varying goals to complete in each level which range from destroying a machine to guiding sheep to their pens.</desc>

Travel over New York City rooftops, streets, subways, sewers, and all the way out to the docks in your attempt to save mankind. Just like in the popular comic book series, Spider-Man can climb walls, stick to any surface, detect danger with his Spider-Sense, and use regular old hand-to-hand combat to take down his enemies. There'll be plenty of awesome power-ups to help you catch Octopus: one-ups, hearts, limited invincibility, and more. Lots of characters from the comic book play significant roles in the hand-held game as well: Venom, Lizard, and Hobgoblin will try to take Spidey down, while Carnage waits at the game's end as a final boss. Fans of the comic series and gamers alike will love this Game Boy adaptation of a time-honored series.</desc>

		<name>The Spirit Of F-1</name>
		<desc>The game features racing in one of two Formula One cars around a variety of tracks near world capitals and landmarks. In the Family Computer version of the game, the cars come in three colors: red, light orange, and dark blue.

Gameplay is similar to that of Namco's Pole Position. Finishing in first, second, or third results in a podium finish; players must win on each track to advance to the next. Vehicles in the game have a generic two-speed manual transmission governing their speed (with a "LOW" setting and a "HI" setting). There are ten tracks in the race; the game repeats itself after the conclusion of the tenth circuit. Three difficult levels help beginners to adjust to the artificial intelligence on "skill level 1" while novices get some extra challenge on "skill level 2" and experts get the ultimate challenge on "skill level 3." A strict time limit forces players to finish races without mistakes in order to progress to a more complicated race track.

Several Nintendo characters appear at the end of race circuits: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Bowser, Link, Samus, Pit and Donkey Kong. The game resulted in a Grand Prix series sequel, featuring Famicom Grand Prix: F-1 Race and Famicom Grand Prix II: 3D Hot Rally.[citation needed] Similar to the original, both games were never released outside of Japan.</desc>

		<name>Spirou - The Robot Invasion</name>
		<desc>Spirou: The Robot Invasion is a 2D side'scrolling platform game based on the Franco-Belgian comic Spirou et Fantasio.

Fantasio bought a strange mechanical device. When he brings it home and thoroughly inspects it, it turns out to be a malevolent robot who subsequently escapes from the house. Soon a villain called Cyanide appears to be involved and the entire town is crawling with evil robots. It's up to the player (as Spirou) to set things straight! Armed with a maul you have to trash the robots. Controls are similar to other platform games: you can walk, jump, attack, use a switch and grab a ledge. You'll have to solve simples puzzles such as pressing switches to open doors. You can pick up items that restore your health or unlock bonus levels. The game also has a UBI key that allows you to unlock a secret level, and can also be used to unlock secrets in other Ubi Soft games.

The game is presented in comic strip style much like in Comix Zone, where you move from frame to frame, each divided by a white border.</desc>

		<name>Star Ocean: Blue Sphere</name>
		<desc>Star Ocean: Blue Sphere is a Role-Playing game, developed by Tri-Ace and published by Enix Corporation, which was released in Japan in 2001. The original game has never been released outside of Japan. On 8th June 2009, a remake was released for mobile phones but so far, only a Japanese version has been released. The text is colloquial with an emphasis on "sci-fi" jargon.

Blue Sphere attempts to adapt traditional Star Ocean gameplay to the Game Boy Color. For the first time, random battles are removed and enemy characters can be seen on the field. When engaged in combat, the screen changes to a side scrolling view and retains real time combat. The characters can only move left and right, and the majority of fighting is influenced through combos. Battle techniques and magic can be assigned to button combinations, making the battle system more similar to Star Ocean's cousin series, Tales.</desc>

		<name>Star Wars Episode I: Racer</name>
		<desc>The game design of the Game Boy Color edition of Star Wars Episode I: Racer is loosely based on the Nintendo 64 version. The game still takes place over multiple planets in the Star Wars universe -- the deserts of Tatooine, the ice tracks of Ando Prime, and swamps of Baroonda. You take control of Anakin and try and defeat your "rival" on each of the game's tracks. When you come in first on any track, you can take control of that track's "rival" alien and his pod racer -- and each alien's Pod Racer controls and drives differently. The controls are of the simple Accelerate, Brake, Left Turn, Right Turn nature -- but like the N64 version of the game, you can activate an Engine Boost when your speed reaches a certain peak. But it's only for temporary use, and will cause damage to your engines if you leave it on for longer than a few seconds.</desc>

Starting with only a knife and a broken radio, you must learn how to survive on the island until someone can rescue you. Food, water, and rest are your main concerns. Luckily, there are plenty of berries, mushrooms, and meat around the island and fresh water flows in all of the streams. As another stroke of luck, there are hollow trees that provide a comfortable place to take a nap. Rather than spend your whole time looking for food and water, collect as many items that a scattered throughout the island. Rocks, sticks, leaves, and other items can be turned into tools that will make your life easier. Try to survive until you are rescued in SURVIVAL KIDS.</desc>

Between newfound enemies and domestic obstacles, the tiny mouse is having one heck of a time! There are eight gigantic levels to conquer in The Journey Home, and each one is based on a scene from the box office smash STUART LITTLE movies (which are, of course, based on the book by E.B. White). You'll end up tackling a mini-golf course, Central Park, a model boat race, a bunch of toy cowboys, and more in this epic quest for peace. In addition, here are plenty of platforms and hazards to run, jump, and flip through, and three difficulty settings ensure that younger gamers and experienced veterans alike will find the game appealing.</desc>

		<name>Super Chase H.Q.</name>
		<desc>Chase H.Q. (チェイスH.Q.?, "Chase Headquarters") is a 1988 arcade racing game, released by Taito. It is sometimes seen as a spiritual successor to Taito's earlier Full Throttle. The player assumes the role of a police officer named Tony Gibson, member of the "Chase Special Investigation Department." Along with his partner, Raymond Broady, he must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits.

The game was well received in the gaming industry, resulting in three arcade-based sequels being released: Special Criminal Investigation (1989), Super Chase: Criminal Termination (1992) and Chase H.Q. 2 (2007). Two spin-offs were also released: Crime City (1989) and Quiz H.Q. (1990).

The game was ported to many home computers by Ocean Software in 1989, including versions for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST. Taito released versions of the game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (1989), Game Boy (1990), Sega Master System (1990), PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 (1990) and Sega Game Gear (1991). It was released for PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2007 as part of Taito Memories II Volume 2.</desc>

Although Acme Oil Co. has been destroyed by James Pond, Pond's arch enemy Dr. Maybe survived and has retreated to the North Pole where he has taken over Santa's workshop. Dr. Maybe is holding Santa's workers hostage (in most versions of the game they are penguins, in some they are elves), and has turned many of Santa's helpers into his own twisted and dangerous assistants. James Pond is recruited to infiltrate Santa's grotto, free the captive penguins, retrieve the stolen toys for the children of the world, and defeat Dr. Maybe once and for all. This time, however, due to the greater risks involved in this mission, Pond is given a robotic suit and the code name "RoboCod" (a pun on RoboCop). This suit gives Pond superhuman strength and agility as well as enabling him to stretch his midsection almost indefinitely and reach otherwise impossibly high areas.</desc>

		<name>Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins</name>
		<desc>In his greatest Game Boy adventure, Mario faces off against his evil rival Wario, who has captured Mario Land and turned it into his private playground.

To toss Wario off his ill-gotten throne, Mario must search all-new worlds for the six golden coins that unlock the gate to Mario's castle. A mob of monsters, old and new, seek to stop him. Along the way, through 6 zones, Mario can nab Power Mushrooms, Super Stars and Fire Flowers for extra power. And if he eats the Magic Carrot, he'll turn into a high-flying hare.

		<name>Super R.C. Pro-AM</name>
		<desc>Super R.C. Pro-Am is a racing video game that is similar to its predecessor, R.C. Pro-Am, for the NES. In the game, players race remote control cars on a series of tracks. It can be played solo, with two-players via the Game Link Cable, or with three or four players via the Four Player Adapter. The game features 24 different tracks of increasing difficulty, and the object is to finish in the top three in order to qualify to race in the next track. Players who do not finish in the top three may use a continue and retry the track; players get three continues, and the game ends when the player fails to finish in the top three and has no continues remaining.
Each track is different and range from standard ovals to tracks with many twists and turns. The game includes many obstacles, such as oil slicks that send players spinning, puddles of water that cause players to slide out of control, sand traps and "slow cones" that slow players down, large cones that bring players to a complete halt, and walls of tires that players bounce off. If a player hits an oil slick and then hits a wall while spinning, the player's car is temporarily destroyed, which loses time. The tracks also has items that help players along the way: "zippers" (a series of chevrons on the track) give players a speed boost, roll cages allow players to hit walls without being destroyed and allow them to crash opponents by forcing them into walls, and missiles and bombs temporarily destroy opponents' cars. Also on the track are spare parts which help improve performance—tires improve traction, batteries increase acceleration, and engines improve speed.
Players have the opportunity to upgrade their vehicles by collecting letters, which are distributed throughout the tracks. By spelling "Nintendo" with the letters, players upgrade to a better vehicle; players can upgrade from the "Racer" to the "Speed demon" and then to the Spiker, each of which performs progressively better than the previous vehicle. If players spell "Nintendo" while racing with the Spiker, then they win the game.</desc>

		<desc>In the South Pacific, Master Higgins lives peacefully wearing only a grass skirt and a cap. That is until the Evil Witch Doctor decides to capture the Princess Leilani and hold her as his own. It's up to Master Higgins to gather throwing axes, fireballs and skateboards in order to aid his noble quest.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way. Bosses await him at the end of levels, all the way to the Evil Witch Doctor himself.</desc>

To rescue this ravishing reporter, you must return to the sewers and dredge forth those reptiles with a penchant for pizza and all the nifty knifework of a chop suey chef. You'll control every move of Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Donatello and Raphael as they arm themselves with head-rattling Nunchakus, back-stabbing Sai Swords, and liver-lashing Katana Blades. Of course, this once in a light year adventure will really start rumbling the nanosecond you bust into 5 never-before-seen levels of Manhattan mayhem, including the Traffic Jam, Waste Dump Ravine and Technodrome Tower. Here you'll perfect the ancient art of icing, dicing and shuriken-slicing. And you'll get the chance to wipe the smirks off the faces of all-new creepshow freaks like Roadkill Rodney, Shell Shocker and that nasty villain Filet O'Filth. So get back into your shell and start snapping away, before April goes from delivering the news to singing the blues in some new cement shoes.</desc>

		<name>Mercenary Force</name>
		<desc>Over one hundred years ago during the mighty Shogun era, the Lord of Darkness sent his fearsome army to terrorize the Japanese countryside. Using the Dark Lord's powerful magic, his evil minions spread famine, plague, and pestilence wherever they went, leaving the peaceful population hopelessly oppressed. All who challenged the wicked Lord were mercilessly slain as a warning to all those who had any further thoughts of rebellion. Then one day while meditating, the great Shogun, Tokugawa, had a divine vision where he saw a small group of mighty warriors rise up to defeat the evil Lord. He immediately set out to recruit the five bravest and most skillful fighters in the land. After months of searching he was finally ready to put his dream into action. It was time to unleash the Mercenary Force.</desc>

		<desc>Tetris is a puzzle video game which was released in 1989 by Nintendo for the Game Boy. Geometric shapes fall from the top of a playfield to rest on the bottom; fit the pieces together and the formed line will disappear. If the pieces are not lined up correctly they eventually stack up to the top of the playfield and the game is over. Difficulty increases by dropping the pieces faster and faster over time. Tetris is a verifiable classic game, translated to well over 200 electronic and computer platforms. It takes 2 minutes to learn, but a lifetime to master!

		<name>Tetris Attack</name>
		<desc>In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send "garbage blocks" to the other player's playfield.</desc>

		<name>Tetris Attack</name>
		<desc>In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send "garbage blocks" to the other player's playfield.</desc>

The game is divided in 5 worlds (The Studios, Ice World, City, Gogo Dodo's world, Looniversity) with varying numbers of sublevels.

Getting to the candy is made complicated by conveyor belts, trap doors and fans as well as dissolving bridges etc. To add to the trouble, clones of popular Tiny Toon characters (Plucky Hamton, Furrball etc.) are programmed to attack the player.

Extras can be collected for extra energy, time etc. The game is presented from a top down perspective. Estimated playtime approx. 30 hours.</desc>

		<desc>Having grown tired of being a mad scientist's assistant, Igor creates four inventions: the diving suit, the helmet lamp, the propeller helmet, and the fireproof helmet. Wanting to test them, he has Phil (a gentle Frankenstein-type monster) put them all on. Unfortunately, the combination of all four inventions causes Phil to explode. You must guide Igor through 15 levels as he searches for all of Phil's parts, as well as all four of his inventions to complete the quest. However, getting through the levels is no walk in the park, as enemies lurk behind every corner. Fortunately, there are plenty of weapons to collect and throw at them. Will Igor be able to restore Phil before the mad scientist comes home? Find the answer by playing TOONSYLVANIA for the Game Boy Color</desc>

		<desc>If you're ready for explosive, mind-twisting puzzle-action mayhem then grab a copy of TROUBALLS from Capcom. In this massively addictive game developed exclusively for the Game Boy Color, it's up to you to gain as many points as you can while the clock ticks down. Here's how it works: different colored balls are attached to moving gears; you rotate the gears in an attempt to get four balls of the same color aligned (in a 2x2 square grid at the bottom of the screen), which blows them to smithereens. This clears the stage and advances you to the next level. There's no time to rest though, as each successive round of sphere-blasting fun is more difficult than the last. You'll listen to five original songs in the challenging, pop-and-bop gameplay that confronts you on more than 100 fast-moving levels. If you couldn't get enough of TETRIS or BUST-A-MOVE, then you'll love TROUBALLS to pieces.</desc>

		<name>Racin' Ratz</name>
		<desc>A variety of little animals take center stage in this racing challenge that takes you through some unlikely environments. Trek through the living room, Grandma's house, a bedroom, and the garage in your quest for glorious victory. There are 25 missions in all, and the action is spread over 10 huge levels. You choose to play as Chris (a cat) or Betty (a little bird), and then take your character through a slew of puzzles, avoiding hazards and collecting power-ups. Finding the appropriate items will allow you to jump across furniture, shrink your car, or even climb over your obstacles. Smart strategy and quick reflexes will help you unlock an extremely trying boss level where you'll take on either a cat or bird in a head-to-head duel. Sometimes the best things come in small packages, and that's certainly the case in this small-scale racing challenge for the Game Boy Color.</desc>

Once he is strong enough, players can successfully defend themselves against larger fish, seagulls that want to grab unsuspecting players out of the water and cats that want to eat players as a tasty snack. A variety of allies (includuing Octo Dude who is an octopus) can help Fish Dude when the problems grow too intense for him to handle alone.

With only three lives to lose until achieving a "game over" screen, the game requires cunning and dexterity to master. Levels allow players to scroll of the screen at the extreme ends of the field and come back on the other side of the playing field. There are 18 levels that get more difficult as the other fish get faster and more predators are introduced in an attempt to kill off the players. Each level concludes after 20 fish have been consumed.

Passwords are introduced from the third level onwards</desc>

		<path>./Virtual Wars (J).zip</path>
		<name>The Lawnmower Man</name>
		<desc>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story) starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training.

With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.

While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters.

The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</desc>

		<name>WCW The Main Event</name>
		<desc>WCW: The Main Event is a professional wrestling video game released in 1994 by FCI for the Nintendo Game Boy portable video game system. It was just the second video game based on World Championship Wrestling, and the first of two released to a handheld console.

Gameplay

There are two types of matches available: a set number of falls (best of one, three, or five) and a set time limit (five, ten, or fifteen minutes). Each wrestler has his unique special move along with punch, clothesline, bodyslam, suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match and an elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers.
Throwing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of the ring. There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters.
[edit]Wrestlers

These wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993. They were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former tag team duo The Steiner Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).</desc>

Choose to play as the Rock, Triple H, the Undertaker, or Stone Cold Steve Austin in this story-based wrestling game. You'll roam the streets, taking down thugs and seeking out valuable information along your journey to redemption. There'll be plenty of objects to pick up and throw, scenery to destroy, and havoc to wreak, but the only weapons you'll be given are your own bare fists and a solid pair of boots. Other weapons (steel pipes, cakes, and mailboxes) are available, though you'll have to defeat a few foes to earn them. Tons of power-ups are strewn throughout the game, but you'll be lucky if you can free up the time and energy to get to them. Awesome graphics, tough boss characters, and a great story make this one unique wrestling title.</desc>

		<name>Woody Woodpecker Racing</name>
		<desc>WOODY WOODPECHER RACING brings all of the classic Woody Woodpecker characters to the Game Boy Color. You can race as 10 different characters on 16 unique tracks. The racing action takes place in four different modes: Extreme, Grand Prix, Sprint, and Time Trial. Extreme has players trying to earn cups in a series of races, where the ultimate goal is to win first place in each race. Grand Prix stages races on the same tracks, but players are awarded points based on where they finish. Doing well in the races in both modes allows you to upgrade your vehicle. Both the Sprint and Time Trial modes allow for competition without the bloodlust of the other two modes. If you want to compete against another person, you can via a link cable. Race with a hyperactive bird in WOODY WOODPECKER RACING.</desc>

Choose whether you want to play three, five, or seven-minute halves, and decide whether you want your overtime decisions to be made Golden Goal or Extended Time-style. The gameplay and decisions are so detailed, you can even select your starting lineup and reserve players, pick a formation, and set up your own strategies. You can engage in any number of exhibition games (alone or against a friend), but the real fun begins in International Cup mode, in which you claw your way up from a ranking of 32nd in the world.

The game was developed and published by Nintendo, with assistance from Argonaut Software. X was followed by an internationally released DSiWare exclusive sequel, X-Scape, in 2010.


The game was influenced by the Starglider series, and was originally slated to be published by Mindscape as Eclipse or Lunar Chase, but Nintendo took over the project after becoming interested in the concept of having three-dimensional graphics on the Game Boy. Then Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi renamed the game X, shortly before its release. The Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu listed X as one of the four most influential Game Boy games released, as it was the first 3D game released for a portable system in Japan.


The game takes place in a wireframe 3D view. The player controls the VIXIV to complete various missions assigned by the Training Academy Coach. Objectives can range from destroying enemy targets, escorting cargo, or defending bases. A short break is provided after the completion of each mission, and the player is awarded a number of stars based on their skill in each level. 10 small stars equal one regular star, and a certain number of stars are needed to continue the game after failing a mission. The game is completed by finishing all ten missions.</desc>

		<desc>In the Game Boy Color version of Xtreme Sports, players compete against more than 200 computer-controlled opponents on 25 different tracks in sports such as street luge, skateboarding, inline skating, surfing and skyboarding. At the start of the game, players choose between characters Guppi and Fin and set off on a trip sponsored by the Xtreme Cola Company, which has invited all extreme sports athletes to Xtreme Sports Island to compete in a tournament. Among the people players encounter are the members of the Bone-Heads gang, who are the antagonists. The player's objective is to unravel the mystery behind them and win the tournament at the same time.

There are two modes available: Practice and Xtreme Island Adventure. In the former, players can participate in 15 different challenges with 3 difficulty settings. In the latter, players move around the island participating in events and exploring the surroundings. Some of the people players meet will give the player clues to solving the mystery of the Bone-Heads while others will issue challenges to compete in various sports. Players collect medals as the player win events. Players must win a certain number of easier challenges before the referees will allow the player into the tougher ones. Along the way players can also find Twitchy Shakes, which are special drinks that will increase the player's abilities depending on the next event the player enters. Players may be able to attain higher speeds or even become invincible.</desc>

		<desc>In the addictive, balloon-bursting tradition of POP 'N POP and BUST-A-MOVE comes YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast from Taito and Bam Entertainment. Jellystone Park is holding a Balloon Fest and Yogi Bear (that's you!) knows this is the perfect opportunity to grab hold of some delicious picnic baskets. But first you need to clear the skies of a ton of fast-moving, falling balloons. Guide Yogi across the bottom of the screen, sending balloons shooting upwards from your special picnic basket. The object is to align three balloons of the same color together. When you do, all three pop and disappear, your score goes up, and more balloons drop down. Clear the whole stack before they reach the ground or it's game over. If you're quick and clever, you can cause high-scoring chain reaction explosions that will make your job a little easier. When you feel ready, you can go head-to-head against a friend in Link cable mode. YOGI BEAR: Great Balloon Blast is Cartoon Network-licensed, party-popping fun for your Game Boy Color.</desc>

		<desc>In Tetris Attack, the player is presented with a playfield consisting of a virtual grid of squares, each of which can be occupied by a block. Blocks are stacked on top of one another and rise steadily toward the top of the playfield, with new blocks being added at the bottom. The player must arrange blocks in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more matching shapes by swapping blocks horizontally two at a time. As matching lines are formed, the blocks are cleared from the screen and any blocks above them fall into the gaps. The game is over when the blocks touch the top of the playfield, or another game-ending condition is met (such as reaching a time limit or clearing blocks below a set line). Clearing more than three tiles in a single move scores a Combo, while Chains are scored when falling blocks from one clear cause another clear to occur. Both of these events score extra bonus points, and in multiplayer Versus games, these also send "garbage blocks" to the other player's playfield.</desc>

Embark on a nine-level quest to collect as many Animal Friend Cards as possible, a task that will require lots of interaction and cooperation with other creatures. Make your way across each side-scrolling level, trying to keep your energy up by eating Goobleberries. If you don't eat enough, you'll run out of energy and fall asleep losing one turn. Collecting 100 Goobleberries will earn you an extra shot at completing the game, but that won't be easy with so many other tasks to keep your mind on. The game is certainly designed for younger players, but three skill settings (easy, easier, easiest) allow the game's difficulty to expand as kids grow accustomed to the challenges. Though the journey is long, games can be saved with the use of a password.</desc>

However, you only have a limited number of shots, and if all sections of the city are destroyed, it's Game Over. After successfully defending a city from two waves of missiles, you will be treated to a special animation that is related to the city. If your friends want to get in on the action, there is an alternating Two-Player mode. Try to defend the world's cities from destruction in MISSILE COMMAND.</desc>

		<desc>In PAPERBOY, all you have to do is deliver the newspaper to your subscribers. While this sounds easy enough, obstacles seem to constantly get into your way...things like dogs, kids on tricycles, traffic, and pedestrians. Since this is your neighborhood, you want punish those who do not subscribe to your paper, so you break their windows with rolled up newspapers. You will even hear the glass shatter thanks to the digitized sound effects and music! At the end of each level there is a bonus course, where you can demonstrate your newspaper-flinging accuracy and earn bonus points. Fortunately, there are three difficulty levels to help you get accustomed to the controls of the game. Will you become the master of your neighborhood or just another punk on a bike? Play PAPERBOY and find out.</desc>

		<name>Chase H.Q.: Secret Police</name>
		<desc>The chase is on in CHASE HQ: Secret Police for the Game Boy Color. Loosely adapted from the arcade game of the same name, CHASE HQ is a unique mix of racing and action for one or two players. In the One-Player mode, you'll lead a handpicked team of undercover cops, each with unique talents. You'll be shown what kind of vehicle the suspect is driving, and then you'll hit the streets to find him. When you finally locate the perp, you'll switch to a behind-the-vehicle view as you try to shoot or bump the criminal off the road. Once you've managed to lower their life-bar far enough, they'll pull over and you'll make the arrest. There are 10 levels of single-player action, so you'll be plenty busy as you try to collar the criminals. You can also grab a friend to play Head-to-Head using a link cable, with one person playing the cop and the other playing the bad guy.</desc>

		<name>Logical</name>
		<desc>LOGICAL adds a distinctive puzzle game experience to the Game Boy Color. Each of the 99 levels starts with a unique arrangement of pipes and slotted gears. Balls of various colors roll through a pipe at the top of the screen, and they'll fall into the gear and pipe arrangement. The goal is to get balls of the same color to fill all of the slots of a gear. Once that happens, the balls disappear. But time is always a factor in doing this, so you've got to be efficient. As the game progresses, several complicating factors enter the mix: some pipes will only allow balls to travel one way, and other will only let balls of one color pass through. The biggest problem is that some levels require colors be removed in a particular order. Try to solve as many puzzles as you can with LOGICAL</desc>

		<name>The Flintstones: BurgerTime in Bedrock</name>
		<desc>The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.</desc>
