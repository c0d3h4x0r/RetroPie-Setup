		<desc>Two teams, the blue army and the red army, compete on tiled maps in an attempt to vanquish one another in battle. Each team starts off in one particular portion of the map, usually but not always on opposite sides. Throughout the map are cities which start out neutral, but can be converted to the red or blue side through occupation. The more cities a team has, the more energy that team produces every round to direct toward the construction of newer and more powerful Gundams. Each team gets to issue three commands per turn, whether it be to move a Gundam around the map, or construct a new Gundam. Each type of robot has different ranges of movement, and different terrains effect how far a robot can travel. In order to destroy each other, players must attack the opposing team's Gundams by moving one of their own to a tile occupied by the enemy. When two Gundams rest on the same spot, a battle is initiated.</desc>

		<name>Putt Putt Golf</name>
		<desc>Putt Putt Golf by Pack-In-Video is one of many golf games for the Famicom and the Famicom Disk System, but one of the few to take players through an abstract world rather than an approximation of a real golf course. The goal of each stage is to reach the hole on the green and pot the ball in as few strokes as possible, but each of the courses are covered with various obstacles - some animated, some stationary. The player must navigate around them (or use them to their advantage, in some cases) in order to achieve the best score.</desc>

		<desc>Otocky can be described as a musical side-scrolling shoot 'em up. The player's spaceship has a ball for a weapon, which can be fired in eight directions; each direction corresponds to a different musical note. The note plays when the player presses the fire button, and is also quantized in time so that it matches the beat playing in the background. By using the weapon selectively the player can improvise music while playing.</desc>
