He tells Shao Kahn that the invitation for Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and if they hold it in Outworld, the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan, and even restores Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory will allow him to subdue Earthrealm.</desc>

    <desc>Up to four human players can take part, each always controlling a single player for their team, and AI for missing players. This allows for four players to face each other in teams of two, or for two players to team up against a third player with a CPU team-mate.

The Tournament Edition ups each team's roster to three players, and allows for substitutions between quarters. Shoving players now results in injuries, which lower a player's stats; encouraging you to sub them out and let them recover. Aside from the usual secret characters and cheat modes, the T.E. also includes four new additions you can individually enable from the special options menu.</desc>

    <desc>WWF RAW is a video game based on the television show of the same name produced by the World Wrestling Federation, released for the SNES, Sega 32X, Mega Drive/Genesis, and Game Boy in late 1994 and early 1995 by Acclaim Entertainment. It is the sequel to the WWF Royal Rumble game that was released in 1993, and is the final part of LJN's 16-bit WWF trilogy. Players can play either One-on-One, Tag Team, Bedlam, Survivor Series, Royal Rumble, or a Raw Endurance Match.

WWF RAW introduces differences between the characters in that they not only have their own signature moves, but differing move sets altogether (including new over-the-top "mega moves"). The game adds many moves not seen in the previous games, such as a DDT, a fallaway slam, and various types of suplexes. Additionally, wrestlers differ in attributes of speed, strength, stamina, and weight.</desc>

    <desc>Virtua Fighter was the first of it's kind: A one-on-one fighting game featuring fully 3D environments and characters. The fighters and arenas are rendered in flat-shaded polygons. Unlike many fighting games, Virtua Fighter focuses on deep gameplay based on actual fighting styles, rather than outrageous special moves and story lines.

There are 8 fighters to choose from in Virtua Fighter, and an equal number of fighting backdrops in which to compete. Each fighter has a distinctive fighting style, and their own set of signature moves.</desc>

    <desc>Fahrenheit is an interactive movie that puts players into the flame-resistant suit of a firefighter. You are the new guy in the firehouse. Last week, you saved three lives. But now, you're on a new squad, and have to prove yourself to them.

 Like most interactive movies, Fahrenheit is played entirely while watching a digitized video. At certain critical points in the video, players must press certain directions on the control pad or action buttons in order to progress in the game. Fahrenheit takes this a step further by providing several buildings in which the player has the ability to move from room to room in in a non-linear fashion. As players move from room to room, they have to locate victims and neutralize fire hazards.</desc>

Five girls who previously stayed there had disappeared, so the "Sega Control Attack Team" ("Sega" changed to "Special" once the game was ported to other consoles) is called upon to protect the new guests and find out what happened. As the new wave of girls arrive for a slumber party (one of whom is undercover SCAT agent Kelly (or Kelli) Medd,[a] played by Dana Plato), the vampiric Augers begin to invade the Martin family house, and it's up to the player to save the girls.</desc>

The action is viewed from your perspective as you travel around the arena. You also have an overall view of where your opponents are. Terrain surfaces and characteristics vary in each battle.
